Ambuj Saxena (talk) 03:48, 25 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] Contested speedy for db-repostI hope this is the right place to get help for this. Lexink was deleted by JzG early on 7/24. I had seen it the first time it was posted and when I saw it reappear today (created by Cocoonprod, I thought it sounded awfully familiar, and I distinctly remember a couple of phrases in particular that I know were used in the article's first incarnation(s). However, note that I am not an admin so I can't see the exact content of the page pre-deletion; I was going by distinctly remembering having read this article on newpage patrol when I decided to add it to speedy as a repost of deleted content. Another user added the advert tag to it as I was reviewing which speedy template to add, so both the advert and db-repost templates were added. I checked back later to find that another username, Nadiamuller, had apparently been created for the sole purpose of removing both of these tags, no doubt to get around the injunction that if you are going to contest a speedy deletion on a page you yourself created, you should use the hangon tag. I restored both the advert and db-repost tags to the article before I considered that this may not have been appropriate to do so, since no matter how obvious it might occur to me that there were shenanigans afoot, it was at least in theory another user who removed the repost tag. That does not, of course, negate the fact that it still does meet the requirements for db-repost. My question is, what is the proper protocol in this situation, specifically with regards to a speedy for reposting? Was I incorrect? Should this now go to AfD? -RaCha'ar 00:44, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Personally I would keep the {{db-repost}} on it and the admin that reviews it can look at the previous incarnation and check. Repost doesn't need to refer to a word for word repost, but the same information with no additions. Removing speedy deletion tags qualifies as vandalism and you should warn the appropriate user - as you said the {{hangon}} should be used. ViridaeTalk 06:16, 25 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] New InfoboxI would like to make a new infobox for my new proposed project. The infobox I will make should include about guitar specifications. So the question is, can I make a brand new infobox? And where can I find the information about it? As I have tried to seach the information about it but couldnt find any.Cheers. -Imoeng 05:55, 25 July 2006 (UTC)You can find information here: Wikipedia:List of infoboxes, but I do believe you are looking for something more like this: Category:Music infobox templates.

If you prefer, you can use my talk page. SynergeticMaggot 06:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Actually that is not exactly I'm looking for. I need something so I can create a new infobox, to explain about guitar specifications e.g. Wood type, company, pickup type etc. So do you know where and how can I make a new infobox? Thanks - Imoeng 06:36, 25 July 2006 (UTC)The template syntax is discussed at help:template. If you don't think you can make one, there's a page for requesting someone else make one for you at Wikipedia:Requested templates. -- Rick Block (talk) 13:11, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Thank you for all helpers, I have been able to make my infobox (see my userpage if you want:) ).

Are you looking for anything in particular? -- Lost 04:34, 22 July 2006 (UTC)That just says how to make one. I responded to the one I am in. I don't see any documentation on what else I am supposed to do or not do. I feel kind of lost. Ste4k 05:29, 22 July 2006 (UTC)(no pun intended. I just noticed it.) Ste4k 06:18, 22 July 2006 (UTC)If you are referring to my signature, no offence taken. I myself feel kind of lost many times, hence the name. Regarding your second question, I will let another, more experienced editor answer it. Better still, you could ask at the talk page of WP:RFC -- Lost 07:19, 22 July 2006 (UTC)If I remember correctly, there's a template which to base off an RFC request which details exactly what you should do. Of course, all the regular rules apply. Have you looked at any existing RFC's to get an idea of how they work? - Mgm|(talk) 08:27, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Thanks for both of you helping on this. I was the subject of the RfC, rather than one of the initiators. I'll look into discussion of the main page later maybe. Keep up the good work.

The page in question is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Chiles The discussion page on it tells what is going on. Can someone please do this for me?Rockydallas 15:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)If in your opinion some article should be deleted, take a look at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion. Jacek Kendysz 16:12, 25 July 2006 (UTC)I've checked that out and it says that in 1 weeks time this article should come up for what appears to be a vote. However, this article was flagged on 7-1 and still has not gone to this vote. The subject of the page has recieved rude emails regarding this page which he was not aware existed and has since contacted me and told me to get the page removed. Yet I can't seem to get this done. I don't get it, the page is attacked for being biased and unfit for wikipedia, yet I can't get it taken down. Any suggestions?Rockydallas 18:31, 25 July 2006 (UTC)On 1 July, a point of view flag was added to the article. This is an invitation to improve it, not a request to delete. You "blanked" the article: but this is recognised as vandalism and promptly repaired. If you believe that an article should be deleted you need to follow the instructions in that article, to nominate it. You need to be able to give clear reasons why this article doesn't belong in Wikipedia  and cannot be improved sufficiently to stay. I'm sorry you've had a bad experience of Wikipedia. Remember that with over a million articles, there have to be some pretty formal procedures to get certain things done. Otherwise anyone could just say "delete that article, won't you!". And remember, too, that Wikipedia is a collaboration: none of us have any special rights over the articles we start.

I just didn't know if I should alert someone to this or not. Thanks. PharmerJess 18:53, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Wikipedia has a very stringent policy regarding copyrights. See WP:Copyrights. An article can be speedily deleted by an admin if it is established as a copyright violation. The article you are talking about however clearly states that it is using material from Wikipedia and not the other way round -- Lost 18:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)PharmerJess, look at the bottom of that URL you gave.

To this day, these issues have no been taken care of. I would like to work on the matter myself, but I know nothing of the topic. My question is: what are wikipedians supposed to do in this situation? Are they just supposed to let the problems go unresolved? 0plusminus0 19:16, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Well, the hope is that someone would notice and take care of it. We have {{cleanup}} templates that add articles to the category of articles needing clean up. That is how we deal with them. I find myself working on articles I know nothing about and usually learn something intersting in the process. It can be tagged with a clean up template and left for someone else or you could work on it. Thanks for spotting it.WAvegetarian(talk) 19:21, 25 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] Both am & am not registered - what gives??Hi, I have just created an account "A12n" (fully completed, that is with the email and confirmation page) and added a comment to the Hausa main page ha.wikipedia.org. However I cannot migrate around the Wikipedia. Moreover, when I log out and try to log back in I usually get a message that there is no such user as A12n. I was able to get in and began to make a comment to the Ewe page ee.wikipedia.org page but was booted off. I tried unsuccessfully to relog on and eventually could but I'm stuck on the Hausa page (even though I changed my preference to the English page).Maybe I'm expecting too much in terms of being able to move about the Wikipedia and keep my identiry, maybe my membership is too new, or maybe it's because I had a Wikipedia window open in another browser (use Firefox 1.5 mainly, but also MSIE6).Is this usual? Do I need to create an identity for each part of the Wikipedia?Thanks in advance for your time and help."A12n"Your identify is specific to each different language version of Wikipedia. If it is free, you can create the same identify in each one, but they are not connected. Notinasnaid 20:07, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Its not being used, so you should be able to make an account here.

SynergeticMaggot 20:12, 25 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] How did I make an edit without updating the history?I found a large image scribbled on Desertification so tried to revert it using a procedure I only vaguely remembered. i.e. go to older revision and save it. This seems to have removed the image but the change I made doesn't appear on the history page. Nevertheless I clicked on the prechanged entry in the history and got a chance to move to a newer revision - the article itself. What's going on? Will the the missing history fix itself or did I find a weird way of making edits that don't appear in the history? If it's a cache problem how can I get at the real history? It doesn't appear to be due my own browser cache. Quirkie 20:15, 25 July 2006 (UTC)What article are you talking about and what process did you use? Try clearing your browser cache. You could be served an outdated history page if editing is really heavy during the time you're editing. - Mgm|(talk) 21:58, 25 July 2006 (UTC)The article in question is the one I mentioned. I also said it wasn't my browser cache. In fact, something more screwy happened. User:Titoxd has now apparently tried to make the same change I did and had to do it twice to get it to work. It would appear that the information about the change that I made got lost, whereas the article retained the change, so that a duplicate change made no effect. Race conditions in mediawiki perhaps. - Quirkie 22:21, 25 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] Editing permissions in namespacesI know this is not the place to ask this, I haven't found an easy to do this (that doesn't require a complex registration process, for one).Does anybody know how can I create namespaces in Mediawiki and allow only some groups to read them? I do know how to control read and write permissions together (there's a patch in Title.php that does the trick). What I want is to control only editing, yet allow everybody to view the namespace.Ripper234 20:37, 25 July 2006 (UTC)There's something at NamespacePermissions Extension on Meta, yet I'm not sure whether it works with the current version of MediaWiki or not.

If you replace that number with 0, you will be editing the introduction only.WAvegetarian(talk) 22:09, 25 July 2006 (UTC)Based on the sound of it, you are editing sections of articles, while not editing the full page. Normally this is useful, so you do not have to scroll through large amounts of text to get to the part you want. However, the first section does not have a button to section edit. Instead you must edit the whole page, which you can do by clicking the "Edit this page" tab at the top of the article.

Sorry.WAvegetarian(talk) 07:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] Article on Winston ChurchillAt the end of the first paragraph of the section of this article headed Family and Personal Life it says Some of the siblings wrote serious books. This is the writer's opinion and amounts to damning with faint praise - something I don't find appropriate. I don't know what these people wrote so I didn't change the sentence but perhaps someone who knows might be able to say: Randolph, Sarah and Mary were all writers who, however, did not enjoy critical success - or something more balanced like that - with references to critical reviews of their work.More seriously, at the end of the paragraph it says,Diana became a prostitute. At first I thought this was obvious vandalism and I was tempted to delete it however I looked back in the history and it seems to have been added by one D22 who also added other things that appear quite reasonable. The article about Diana Churchill doesn't say anything about her being a prostitute. There is a vague, Diana caused her parents great distress as an adult and it does report she was mentally ill but nothing about prostitution. Of course the dead can't be libelled but surely this kind of provocative statement must have a reference attached.--Lebois 07:18, 26 July 2006 (UTC)Thank you very much for spotting this. I'm not sure where the first of those questionable sentences came from, but I agree that is is inappropriate to state that without any sources. The second one was vandalism. It wasn't added by D22 however, D22 was trying to fix vandalism by someone else but diddn't quite catch all of it. I have removed both. Thanks again for fact checking.WAvegetarian(talk) 07:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] Speedied articlesWhere do I go to see a list of speedy deleted articles?

A couple of people have brought up the concept of "maintainability" and are claiming that the article is "unmaintanable". It seems like a fairly abstract concept that people use the way they see fit. Are there any established Wiki guidelines or definitions on this term? A quick search of the Help pages turned up nothing. Let me know, preferably on my talk page. Thanks! SliceNYC 13:06, 26 July 2006 (UTC)From my point of view, this unmaintainable probably means that the article could be change (badly) by other people easily, as maybe you didn't cite the best reference. Citation is very important because it tells where did people get the information. Without that, anyone could change it with their own mind, thus its unmaintainable. - Imoeng 13:48, 26 July 2006 (UTC)The Wikipedia:Deletion policy details the reasons why an article may or may not be deleted.

Pigs are known to fly. Every president of the Ukraine has been a pig."My first thought would be to simply delete these, but I have been told that such "blanket deletions" are unacceptable.I recently encountered the Mini Mammoth page, which included a number of such statements about sightings of Mini Mammoths, uses for Mini Mammoths and so forth. This relates to an amusing Wikipedia prank being played by an Australian radio station, JJJ.I deleted or modified the "joke" statements, and left the true or uncertain statements intact, but was told by other contributors that this was not an acceptable edit, and to flag the statements instead with [citation needed].In cases such as these, it seems a waste of time to flag a statement such as "There already exists a black market for mini mammoth tusks for use as toothpicks" with [citation needed], rather than deleting it.What would you recommend in such cases?Ordinary Person 04:07, 27 July 2006 (UTC)A core policy of Wikipedia is Wikipedia:Verifiability. If a statement can be verified using a reliable source, then it deserves to be on Wikipedia. Hence if a statement has been inserted by another editor in good faith, but you think it may not be true, the above tag is more appropriate. However, if you see blatant vandalism, just go ahead and remove it. -- Lost 04:13, 27 July 2006 (UTC)If you think it is quite obviously a hoax, delete it and if necessary (if you think it is going to cause trouble) not why on the talk page. Obvious hoaxes should NOT be left in an article. Any iffy statements could also be moved to the talk page (state why) untill such time as someone can come up with a reference - not the usual way of doing things, but things you think are probobly a hoax or wildly inaccurate. This stops people getting angry. If you could provide me with some diff links I could maybe give you better advice. ViridaeTalk 04:15, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Thank you for your help. This is the article, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Mammoth, which has now been marked for consideration for deletion, so perhaps I should just let that take its course. I described the changes I made in this subsection, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mini_Mammoth#Clean_Up. The changes were subsequently reverted, and I'm not interested in getting into a reversion battle. In that section, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pontifexmaximus suggests I just use the [citation needed] flag.Judging by the AfD the article will probobly not be deleted due to no concensus. I have left a note for Pontifexmaximus on the talk page. You might like to read it. ViridaeTalk 05:14, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Changed my mind - most of the keep sare newbie votes which appear to have little merit. ViridaeTalk 05:32, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Thank you. So how long does it normally take the closure committee to decide on these things? Ordinary Person 05:49, 27 July 2006 (UTC)5 or 7 days - I can't remember. The information should be availiable in WP:AFD or Wikipedia:Deletion process. It may be closed early if there is overwhelming support for deletion or keep. I have reverted the article twice, and that is as far as I will go. I have no intention of gettiung into an edit war with someone who doesn't understand wikipedia policy. ViridaeTalk 06:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)5 days is the minimum, but there is often a queue of around 2-3 days. Currently there are a few AfDs from 18th July waiting to be closed. See WP:AFD/Old.Also, the 'closure committee' consists of everyone who wants to lend a hand. Even non-admins can close debates, as long as they haven't ended in a consensus for delete (deletion requires admin buttons) and, to quote Wikipedia:Deletion process, "they know what they are doing". --Sam Blanning(talk) 11:37, 27 July 2006 (UTC)I use the citation needed template for facts that appear to be true but need sources still.

Is there anything that can be done? It seems a little bias and cumbersome to write "Image:Flag of Canton of Zrich.svg|25", where, using the ISO codes, "flagicon|CHE-ZH" would be easier to use.I realize that not all divisions have flags. But for the ones that do, isn't there a way to work through the wikicode? To be fair, this would have to be only used where all of the nation's divisions do have flags (such as Ireland's counties).Thanks for your time.--Paploo 05:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC){{flagicon}} is actually a fairly intricate template -- it references other templates, which in turn reference still more. Template redirects are also involved. I'll spare you the technical details: all you need to do is create a new template called {{country flag alias CHE-ZH}}, at which point {{flagicon|CHE-ZH}} will do what you're looking for. For a reference, look at {{country flag alias Japan}} and see how it's built up. If you need help, reply here or send me a talk. Luna Santin 06:12, 28 July 2006 (UTC)The way to make CHE-ZH work would be to click on the red link above and edit it so that it says Flag of Canton of Zrich.svg. (If you wish to you may follow that by <noinclude>Image:Flag of Canton of Zrich.svg</noinclude>. This optional secondary bit will make the image display on the template page so that you know what you're working with.) WAvegetarian(talk) 06:20, 28 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] Renaming a section title--not a page titleThe Wikipedia editing instructions indicate to avoid changing the names of sections as there might already be links to it. Indeed, on the page I am working I know there are links to certain sections. However, some of the section titles are incorrect. Do I leave them as such? Is there nothing to do? Is there a way I can back track and see which and how many references there are to a section?Thanks,--IsaacIsaac, could you give us the link to the article? So, the way to put in internal link is to put double of this "[" before and double of this "]" after the word, e.g User:Imoeng.

Hope that helpsImoeng 00:18, 28 July 2006 (UTC)Unfortunately, I don't think there's a tool you can use to check to see what section titles are linked to. You can use "what links here" and check them one-by-one, but obviously that's a bit tedious. However, if the section titles are harming the quality of the article, I recommend you change them, and hopefully people will fix the broken links as they come across them. EWS23 (Leave me a message!) 00:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)P.S.- Could you tell us what page it is?

He gets this message: "Your user name or IP address has been blocked from editing. You were blocked by Mackensen for the following reason (see our blocking policy): targeted range block Your IP address is 70.130.185.251." I presume he was not the target of the block, since his specific IP does not appear on the block log, but apparently someone with a similar IP was. Any way to exclude his IP from the block?

I'm new at this. I recently, today, entered an article on the history of Quaker Oats and my home town of Ravenna. I'm not perfectly clear as to how to enter an article. There is already one article on Quaker Oats but I've researched the earlier history of the company in relationship to my city.I then submitted an article for publication. I've waited a while to see where it would appear. It has not. Though, since then, I believe that I've received a warning that I may have affected another person's information. This was not my intent at all.I've read you information as to how to get started but I felt that the directions were as clear as mud. I couldn't make heads or tails of how to enter, or edit, an article both old or new.Could you please print me a step by step method of directions to do this. I have so much more information that I've gathered over the years.I would appreciate your help.Respectfully, Richard Rufener (******@****.***)If you enter information, it should appear immediately. Just type in the title in the search box and click go ('Go' is case-sensitive). The message you got about affecting another person's info is probably a vandalism warning aimed at someone using the same IP as you, which is unfortunately quite common. Where you logged in when you got the message?

In both cases, the user has also been uncivil in his or her response, and both have engaged in personal attacks. Because Wikipedia:Removing warnings is only proposed policy, I'm afraid to push too hard in telling the users that they shouldn't be removing legitimate warnings from their talk pages, and I'm also having difficulties finding the best way to deal with their other misbehavior, much of which seems to be trolling. A request for comment might seem applicable in both cases, but I know I'm supposed to try to find a better solution first, and would like to. Neither user seems cooperative, however, so I'm somewhat at a loss in terms of how to proceed. ----Emufarmers(T/C) 06:33, 30 July 2006 (UTC)I think maybe you should post this to WP:AN. SynergeticMaggot 06:35, 30 July 2006 (UTC)Will do: I'd decided to post it here because most of the other places I looked at said they weren't for dispute resolution. Thanks, though. ----Emufarmers(T/C) 06:38, 30 July 2006 (UTC)Yeah if someone removes warnings, you should try and notify an admin. I'm not entirely sure what the process is, but I know its not good to remove warnings from your user page/talk page. SynergeticMaggot 06:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)WP:VANDAL is policy and it is stated there: The above does not apply to the user's own Talk page, where users generally are permitted to remove and archive comments at their discretion, except in cases of warnings, which they are generally prohibited from removing, especially where the intention of the removal is to mislead other editors. It's worded slightly weasely, but its a pretty good fit here.--Fuhghettaboutit 06:50, 30 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] questions about signinghello wikipedia people,i could not find detailed information on signing. do i sign my name like this: Markkrom 01:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)? or this: --Markkrom 01:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)? how does wikipedia understand this signing to be mine? is it linked up with my email address, or with my user page?mark Markkrom 01:30, 30 July 2006 (UTC)Please see Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages -- Rick Block (talk) 01:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)To be specific, the important part is the ~~~~, which adds the name and date - you can sign --~~~~ or ~~~~, the two hyphens are just for decoration.

The report credited Dr. Hans Liebherr of Germany with inventing the first tower crane in 1949. I searched the web and discovered what I believed were U.S. patent numbers applied for in 2001 in the name of Dr. Leibherr's company for a subsequent version or versions of the tower crane. A U.S. construction industry magazine, simply identified the crane, the company and "patent numbers..." followed by a list of patent numbers. I searched the U.S.Patent Office database on line and the numbers were not recognized. I found other web sites that simply state Dr. Liebherr invented the tower crane but do not cite a source. There doesn't appear to be a way to verify the inventor short of contacting the German Patent Office to see if a patent exists in that country. A visit to the History Channel turned up no information. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. The reason I believe verification is important aside from Wiki requirements is that I also found reference to a French variation of the tower crane that appears to have been invented after 1949. I had planned to insert the inventor's name into the existing Wiki article on tower cranes. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Walt Isgro205.209.85.207 17:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)Since there seems to be a small conflict in knowing who invented it, or which version, you should check your local library or book store for a books references. You can also check (small possibility) major newspapers, and other magazines for information. Such archives might provide you with details.

If I obtained all my images through screenshots on my computer, what do I have to do to keep it free and legal?-Dark Kubrick 01:17, 31 July 2006 (UTC)As long as there aren't a lot of screenshots of these particular films already used in their articles, the images should qualify for fair use. Just make sure that they are low resolution, and then tag them with {{film-screenshot}}. Also, make sure you add a fair use rationale for each one. Check out Wikipedia:Fair use for more information. --Hetar 02:13, 31 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] Question about speedy deleting imagesWP:CSD says that images lacking copyright info may be deleted 7 days after they are tagged as such, and thus placed into categories like Category:Images with no copyright tag (from {{untagged}}, like the bot does). Yet that category still has images from 17 days ago, and lots of them. Is this just because no one has gotten around to it, or does an image with no copyright tag have to have been in Category:Images with unknown copyright status (from {{no licence}}) for 7 days to be deleted? CSD claims that either is enough to delete it, but only those in the 2nd actually seem to be getting deleted. Is it worth it, then, to manually change {untagged} to {no licence} so it gets done, or is it unneccisary? -Goldom   05:21, 31 July 2006 (UTC)It has to be tagged with nld or nsd for seven days before it can be deleted, so yes, if you wanted the image to be deleted you will need to tag it accordingly.

How can I help?Tami [email removed for your protection]Probably the best way to get started is to just read the articles on the subjects you are interested in. Register for an account, and make sure you are logged in; this is important for following your own work, and for your credibilit. Make small edits; after a little while see what happened to them. Did they "stick"? If not, look at the article history or talk page to see what happened. If you disagree, begin or join in discussions on the talk pages. In any case, read the talk pages of the articles you are interested in; often there is a lot of history behind a small sentence. In this way you will not only be contributing, you will be getting to know how Wikipedia works. In particular, the style of encyclopedia articles is unlike many other kinds of article; for example they never express your opinion, and should cite sources. After a while, as you grow in confidence, you may want to add missing articles or do something else more ambitious. I would always advise new editors against starting with new articles. Finally, always sign your contributions to discussions by adding ~~~~; but never sign contributions to articles. Notinasnaid 09:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Also, feel free to join a WikiProject.

Why was the work of a proper photographer who actually lives in the city removed?Ian KehoeThe best thing to do would be to upload the images here. Please be sure however, that the images mention the source, copyright holder and the appropriate license or they will be removed.

Now I'd like to know what other links or templates or references I need to update, to complete the job as far as I am able, that is, apart from adding facts to the article itself. I'm thinking of templates that should ideally be added, lists of articles that should be updated, entries in indexes, or list of articles requesting input or some such that is not automatically done. I'd like to do it myself, to learn by doing, rather than having it done by another, so just an indication/name of something do or to look up would be appreciated. I have started making an "article check list" for myself to go through when doing an article. Is there such a checklist already available?

I see where I made the citation mistake, but when I looked at the article I didn't even notice it. I'll forgive myself for that by noting that I was tired - I'm on UTC+2 time, and it was 3:30am or thereabouts here. I've added WP:MoS to my Firefox Scrapbook, so that it's readily available, and have installed the Wikipedia toolbar (still have to work out what it does, though:)). And I'll be looking for a pic. Maybe a photo of the Carhart portrait on display in the deaf school here, suitably labelled, would be interesting - it sort of adds value if the reader realised that the portrait is displayed more than 10,000 miles from where the man worked - another continent, another country. But I'd first have to find out who owns the pic, etc - hope it works out copyright wise. And then Persondata is exactly the sort of thing I was asking about, something which may well have taken me months to discover in all those help pages. The use of the template makes sense to me. And so in it goes, I'm off to fill in the template. --Seejyb 22:13, 31 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] Article does not come up when I searchI constructed the article below- which also appears in recent changes.

See WP:VFAQ#An article doesn't show up in the search -- Lost(talk) 16:42, 31 July 2006 (UTC)Don't worry about the search index ("search", not "go"), but do worry about "go" and do worry about links. Links are case sensitive, so links have to exactly match the article's title. This link works: The Wilberforce Wanderers AFC. If you want ANY other link to work, you have to add a redirect. Please see wikipedia:redirect. If you want to be able to get to the article by typing anything except "The Wilberforce Wanderers AFC" in the "search" box and clicking "go" (not "search"), you need to add redirects for this purpose as well. How "go" works is described at wikipedia:go button. It generally masks the fact that article titles are case sensitive, but doesn't in this case. If you want to be able to type "the wilberforce wanderes afc" and click "go" and get to the article, you'll need to add a redirect. I'd suggest The Wilberforce Wanderers Afc in this case. -- Rick Block (talk) 23:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)[edit] Most visited pages in WikipediaIsn't there a list of most visited pages in Wikipedia?

However, in an hour, I need to go to bed, so it is unlikely for me to finish the article in a good condition. So my question is, is there a way to tell the "deletionist" that I'll continue my article tomorrow? Thanks for your time! Imoeng 10:32, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Hmm, you could try {{underconstruction}}, possibly along with a note at the talk page. There's a few other alternatives at Wikipedia:Template_messages/Cleanup (from WP:TEMP or WP:TEMPLATE). Hope that helps, good luck.:) Luna Santin 10:39, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Cheers, that is exactly what I need.:) Imoeng 10:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Some users also tend to create drafts in their userspace before adding it to the article namespace Minun Spiderman  Review Me 11:12, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Just to note that adding that tamplate to a page probably won't last. It is normally used for persistent updating so any article with no edits for a few hours may get it removed by a passing editor. It certainly won't keep the deletionists away. The best bet is to say in oyur last edit summary coming back to this tomorrow to add more and to add a note on the talk page. Although it depends what state you leave the article in - if it is of ufficine length and is on a notable subject the most that should happen is that it gets tagged to be wikified or copyedited. Otherwise it is unlikely to get speedy or instantly deleted, if it is nominated for deletion it will most likely be with the {{PROD}} template which allows 5 days for an editor to come back and improve the article. Basically don't worry it should still be there tomorrow!!! --Errant Tmorton166(Talk)(Review me) 12:42, 1 August 2006 (UTC)All great advice here. Yes, typically if I'm writing a large article or making a large change I will either write the change in Notepad and then copy/paste when complete or I'll create a subpage in my userspace. Another alternative to {{underconstruction}} is {{inuse}} or in your case {{inuse|1 day}}. Only use this if there are no other primary editors on your page.--NMajdantalk 16:54, 1 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] How is a page made to "hit" on a search?Pynchon's new novel is called Against the Day. If you enter against the day in the search box and click Search, you get a massive list with no direct hits. Most of them seem to have something to do with holidays and/or wars. If you enter the same phrase and click Go, you end up at "No page with that title exists." However, if you enter Against the Day, same phrase, just capitalized, and click Go, you get the correct page. How could I get the phrase search to go to the right page?--Snowsim 14:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)"Go" simply does that - it goes to the page with that exact name, with exactly the same capitalizations. The "Search" button searches Wikipedia for a page with similar title and text. But note that the Wikipedia search engine is only updated sporadically, and will not display new pages. Google will not have the latest pages idea, but it will often be more up-to-date than Wikipedia's search engine. To use Google to search Wikipedia, add "site:en.wikipedia.org" to your search query.

Keakealani //Me/Pokeh// 07:40, 2 August 2006 (UTC)For the spam problem, you can use the formal warning messages listed in Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace.

Road Wizard 07:45, 2 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] Marking articles for deletionHow do you mark offensive or inaccurate articles for deletion? We wrote an article on our organization, Teens Transforming the Community, and some students from our school thought it would be funny to alter the information to make it inaccurate. We now regret publicizing the details of the organization and would like to retract/delete the article before national corporations view the inaccurate version. Thank you.I have marked it for speedy deletion as primary author requesting deletion. ViridaeTalk 00:47, 2 August 2006 (UTC)However, it may not go ahead, seeing as two editors have made substantial edits. If you could both log in here and indicate (on this page or the talk page of the article) that you wish it to be deleted then it would be more likely. IF the speedy deletion does not occur, try marking it with {{prod}} ({{prod|the reason you want it deleted goes here}} at the top of the article, which will get it deleted in 5 days if it is not contested or I would be happy to nominate it for Deletion at WP:AFD on your behalf. Feel free to ontact me here or on my talk page, by clicking the talk link in my signature. ViridaeTalk 00:51, 2 August 2006 (UTC)Putting this particular genie back in its bottle may never really be possible, even if the article is deleted here; it may have found its way to the many Wikipedia mirrors. Please note also, that writing about yourself, or your own organisation, or using Wikipedia to promote anything is highly frowned upon. The argument goes that if something is notable enough, then someone else will write about it. This may be in your favour, however; you can nominate this article for deletion on the grounds that it is not notable enough: Wikipedia certainly doesn't plan to list every after school club in the world. So you may be able to get rid of it that way. However, you have no automatic right to delete, because you agreed to release what you wrote as part of the deal. Good luck in sorting it out, though!

Thanks for the info. ViridaeTalk 12:23, 2 August 2006 (UTC)No problems, it is the side affect of the evolution of html / xhtml. The <br> tag used in all html standards works fine but when this was upgraded to xhtml standard they made the parsing stricter. With html you could leave, say, a <div> tag with no closing tag and things will work fine, with xhtml you have to have a closing tag. Single tags like <br> don't have a closing tag but the xhtml standards say it must be closed by adding a space and forward slash - <br />. At the moment most browsers are backwards compatible with html and so it isnt a problem but it's always best to use the most current version.To make matters worse Xhtml 2 is on it's way which takes html syntax right back to it's xml roots - which is a good idea but will make changing to the new standard annoying lol --Errant Tmorton166(Talk)(Review me) 12:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)I think it's unlikely XHTML 2 will ever be widely adopted. It will end up being more like a fork of HTML than a viable standard on its own--it just sacrifices too much backwards compatibility. rodii 13:01, 2 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] Can I publish on my Wikipedia page?Hello,My question, can I write about the organization I recently founded and publish my website address, on my Wikipedia page?My name is Kishmir L.

Dar-Ape 20:10, 1 August 2006 (UTC)If you noticed, Dar-Ape, RobbieG already has a user account and used it to ask the question. Point aside, depending on the type of block, you may or may not be able to edit even with logging in. It's been only recently that the developers have introduced the feature of being able to block only IP addresses and not user accounts using the ip address. However it's my belief that most admins have readily taken up this option and and you more than likely are able to still edit with your user account. If this isn't the case with a particular IP address, just email the blocking admin explaining your situation, that you are a registered user and you would like to be able to edit.

One would be to edit it yourself to fit NPOV better (and thus less advert-y), or at least bring up the subject on the article's Talk page so that other editors can share their opinions and help edit the article to be more encyclopedic. The other suggestion would be to nominate it for deletion and allow other editors to discuss whether or not they feel it has merit as an article or should be deleted.Regardless of who has edited an article, everyone has the right to change things they feel aren't right, so just be bold.Keakealani //Me/Pokeh// 21:44, 2 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] Copyright issue on X-Ray pictureI have a radiograph on my teeth, and would like to put it on Wisdom teeth.

If I take a photo of you, it is my copyright, not yours. If I hand you the photo it is still my copyright, even if I give you the negatives and everything. There is a lot of discussion of this on http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/33217. To be on the safe side, call your dentist and ask if they claim copyright (as they are entitled to); if not you should note this fact on the image page. Notinasnaid 11:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)The picture may be muddier than thatand pardon my choice of phrase. There's an argument that the dentist produced the x-ray (for example) as a work for hire. The dentist was paid to produce the image in the course of his regular workand I'm sure that he billed you (or someone) for it. The law on this one probably varies by jurisdiction, and I suspect that there's very little in the way of case law anywhere on this point. TenOfAllTrades(talk) 13:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)Well, from Wikipedia:Copyright_FAQ, "copyright is the right that the producer of a creative work has been granted to prevent others from copying it". There is probably no creative way to take an x-ray image, all dentists must follow the same standard procedure; the object being displayed (teeth) probably also cannot be copyrighted. So x-ray images probably are ineligible for copyright, in my opinion. --Leeyc0 (Talk) 14:39, 2 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] How World Tourism Organization help Goa tourismin India?--125.22.91.180 14:05, 2 August 2006 (UTC)anoopmonarchUm, I think you should be inquiring at the website of World Tourism Organisation.

In early May or late April of this year, sometimes between 6:00-7:00 AM, a new story regarding the above was broadcasted. Specifically, the story highlighted the absence of enforcement of these federal privacy regulations and changes forthcoming. I'm doing some research on these items, and I'd like to get a copy or transcript.

Help with this would be greatly appreciated! --Grudolph 00:32, 3 August 2006 (UTC)Ah, you're giving us too much credit.:) It's not really anything you set, per se, the notices you see are just added manually. Head on over to the category page, edit it, and just add "The main article for this category is Foo" or whatever particular phrasing you prefer, to the top. A category page will generally include a very small amount of text -- say, the main article, the parent categories, interwiki links, and maybe criteria for inclusion. The rest should all be automatic. Does that help? Luna Santin 00:38, 3 August 2006 (UTC)Aha! No wonder I couldn't find a way to do that.

The subject/keyword turned up nothing in Wikipedia. How do I have the article inserted in the Wikipedia? Name of the article is GWARIGHAT.ksdograThe sandbox is just for test edits; nothing lasts long in there. If you want to create an article on Wikipedia, you need to do a search for that article's title, and if it doesn't find it, click the link to create it. In this case, it would be GWARIGHAT. Keep in mind, though, that what you have in mind might not work for a few reasons: For one, material on Wikipedia shouldn't be copyrighted material from elsewhere (this would apply if you didn't write that material yourself, or didn't want to license it under Wikipedia's copyright policy. There are a few other potential problems, but you're free to create an article, at any rate; just be aware that if it happens to violate one of Wikipedia's guidelines, it might be deleted. --Emufarmers(T/C) 01:05, 3 August 2006 (UTC)The sandbox is just for practice, and so your practice was wiped out a little later. It is still in the history: if you want to rescue your work, here is a link to it [1]. You can copy and paste to save the text and make a new article. Note that the title of the article would not be in capitals: it would be Gwarighat. Important: you include an author credit. This suggests that the article is copyright. The author's permission to give all rights to Wikipedia would be needed, to keep Wikipedia legal. It is better to completely rewrite in your own words, and with your own structure. Notinasnaid 07:00, 3 August 2006 (UTC)It doesn't mean signing over all rights to Wikipedia, but we do need the owner to release it under a free license, meaning the text could be reused by any Wikipedia visitor who follows the rules (including commercial use) and it could be heavily edited. Also, we need definite proof the person giving the permission can do so. Therefore, we need an email message at permissions at wikimedia dot org from a recognizable email address. -- Mgm|(talk) 10:39, 3 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] i want address of al noor hospital in makkahhello i want address and phone number of al noor hospital in makkah?Sorry, the help desk is more for questions directly related to using, browsing, and editing Wikipedia.

Luna Santin 08:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] Where to report...Is there a replace for reporting systematic copyright problems? I seem to have discovered a user who has uploaded lots of images, which were tagged as not having a source, who then dealt with the issue by removing the "no source" tags. Maybe this will get sorted out in time, but when I see something more complex than a single image with a bad license claim, is there a place to note it for attention from someone more versed in the necessary rules, procedures and diplomacy?

Now if someone left a message there, would I also get the "you have new messages" at the top of every page, as is the case with my normal talk page? I tried this myself, but of course that doesn't work because when I do that I myself have just visited it (this also doesn't work with my normal talk page). Of course the simplest way to answer this would be for someone to actually leave me a message there (just saying 'hi' or something). The talk page is User talk:DirkvdM/Photographs. Thanks.

Luna Santin 07:00, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Indeed, I didn't get the message. Too bad. I don't check my watchlist very often and the sort of message I expect will be important (requiring a fast reply) but rare. Of course I could put my email address on my user page, but then would that be an invitation for spammers? Or don't they check such pages? DirkvdM 09:46, 1 August 2006 (UTC)I recommend you redirect that talk page to your regular one to allow for the orange box to appear. - Mgm|(talk) 10:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Thanks for the magic, McGyver, but then I might as well just use the regular talk page.:) DirkvdM 19:43, 3 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] comparison tableI noticed that a lot of articles have templates to consolidate information into tables that look the same from article to article. Is there some way to show all that information in a single table without hand-typing it? For example, every NFL team has a template. On NFL, it would be nice to have a table of pertinent information for each team. It would be in one place so you don't have to keep jumping from article to article. If someone updates a template, the main table updates automatically. Is that possible? Youth in Asia 20:13, 2 August 2006 (UTC)Actually, yes, that's what Wikipedia:Templates are for. ~Kylu (u|t) 21:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)I have looked at templates and I cannot find any sort of "tag" that will create a dynamic table containing the data from all templates. Using my example above, what "tag" do I put in NFL so that the information from all the NFL team templates shows up in one big comparison table? Youth in Asia 12:41, 3 August 2006 (UTC)To my knowledge, you cannot do that. I did make an extension that does it, but it isn't part of Wikipedia. See http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/TemplateTable_extension if you have your own wiki and you want to use it. --Kainaw (talk) 17:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] Seeking participants on Requests for feedbackSeveral months ago, I created Requests for feedback, an initiative for new editors to seek feedback on new articles they write (or major edits they make to existing articles). This feedback will help them understand their strengths and weaknesses as an editor - for example, they may be excellent with screenshots and NPOV, but weak in referencing and linking. Hopefully they will use the feedback they receive to improve their editing skills and the articles they make.I created RFF after trying to get feedback on two articles I wrote, Google Groups and Homerun (film), but finding established processes such as Peer Review and Requests for Expansion not meeting my needs. Traffic is growing and we currently receive a couple of requests for feedback from new editors daily. It seems my idea is popular among newcomers, and I intend to develop it into an established Wikipedia process.Currently, there are only 4 Wikipedians who regularly respond to requests for feedback posted on RFF: Hildanknight, Tangotango, Saxifrage and Imoeng. We will need more regular participants in this project; hopefully experienced Wikipedians who are familiar with Wikipedia process and friendly towards newcomers.I am therefore posting here, requesting help on making RFF an established Wikipedia process, and seeking regular participants who will respond to requests for feedback posted on RFF.--J.L.W.S.

I wanted to change it, but couldn't find where it was. I looked at:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Citation_neededBut that didn't seem to be it. Somebody else changed it eventually before I could find out where I needed to go. I was wondering, for future reference, where that template is located so I can roll it back in case of such a situation. Cat Parade 16:59, 3 August 2006 (UTC)Errr, it was actually citations missing, but nonetheless... Cat Parade 17:02, 3 August 2006 (UTC)First of all, links to wikipedia pages should be made with double brackets, so [[Template:Citation needed]] becomes Template:Citation needed. You edit a template in its page in the template namespace. Template:Citation needed is just a redirect to Template:Fact, so you can edit that page. Now, you'll have to be more specific. If the template that was vandalized wasn't Template:Citation needed, which one was it? -- Meni Rosenfeld (talk) 19:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] Pipes HELP!!!I don't understand how to use pipes. my keyboard doesn't have a backslash on it. It only has forward slashes like this "/" and using shift makes it into a question mark.There should be a button that allows you to type \ that is right above the enter key. If not, you can go into the character map and find the | character. In Unicode, this character is &007C;. Rylng 17:20, 3 August 2006 (UTC)When you're in edit mode on a wikipedia page, below the edit summary screen is a whole list of symbols, Simply clicking on one should add it to the document. The pipe is the second symbol in the "Symbols" list. If that doesn't work, you can simply highlight the pipe, copy to your clipboard and paste it into the document. To do this, you can highlight something and in most browsers, go to the "edit button" in your browser screen at the top; click "copy", and to paste, simply place your cursor where you want to paste, go back into the edit function and click "paste." An easier way of doing this is highlighting something and clicking control + c to copy, and control + v to paste (on most PCs) or the same, but the apple key + c or v for Macs. --Fuhghettaboutit 18:00, 3 August 2006 (UTC)On an average keyboard (102 qwerty), holding shift and hitting the / key should produce a? - as that is the shifted code for that key. The backslash is an entirely different key. Shifting that produces |. Now, if this is a foreign language keyboard, the backslash is left out. For example, on a Spanish keyboard you have to use alt-gr combination to type it. --Kainaw (talk) 18:11, 3 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] Password emailHi I forgot my password so I clicked the forgot password link and they said a email would be sent to me but I didn't receive one.

On a comic book site, I found a picture that I wanted to use in an article I edited. I sent out an email to the administrator of the site in which I asked him for permission. He said I can use it here, and now I don't know how to prove it to you(I have the email). On the upload page I could not find an answer so I ask here, because need a fast answer to finally complete the article.--Captain ginyu 22:31, 1 August 2006 (UTC)Have the site administrator send an e-mail to permissions(at)wikimedia(dot)org. Note that if it is not fair use, they must specifically allow its use under the GFDL (or public domain). If it is not fair use, it would not be enough for them to only allow Wikipedia to use. Wikipedia articles are copied and used on dozens of other websites. Centrxtalk 22:36, 1 August 2006 (UTC)In addition, if the picture in question is of, or features, copyrighted characters (ie pretty much all comicbook characters) or copyrighted art then the website administrator cannot actually give you permission to use it, unless they themselves created the characters/art (scanning it in doesn't count). --Daduzi talk 12:26, 2 August 2006 (UTC)Yeah well, this is all nice, but I don't understand how most articles about comic book characters have often more than one picture. By the way you put it, it is unbelievable to me that everyone would go through so much trouble every time he or she wants a picture to upload on wikipedia...--Captain ginyu 18:38, 2 August 2006 (UTC)Generally images of comic book characters on Wikipedia are covered by fair use, which doesn't require permission. Fair use images on Wikipedia are limited by fairly strict rules, however, and you have to make sure that fair use criteria are followed. So if somebody has an image of Superman on their website you can download it and use it on Wikipedia without asking for the website owner's permission, provided you follow all the rules on fair use images (if you don't the image may be deleted). --Daduzi talk 06:18, 4 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] August 2[edit] Keeping my username in other WikiprojectsIs there a way for me to extend this username to cover all Wikimedia sites I want to use, so I have an over-arching Wiki username? Or do I have to create a separate account for each one? -Vnaughtdeltat 17:28, 3 August 2006 (UTC)No. Some Wikimedia sites won't even let you create a username. What could happen is that a trusted site can create something like an LDAP. Then sites can volunteer to authenticate through that LDAP. But, to my knowledge, nothing like that exists. --Kainaw (talk) 17:34, 3 August 2006 (UTC)No, this is unavailable. Now you need to create separate account for all Wikimedia sites, but maybe in future we will have 'single login' (see meta:Single login specifications for further information). Jacek Kendysz 17:38, 3 August 2006 (UTC)In order to prepare for the m:Single login specifications, and to ensure a speedy transition, it is suggested that you (1) Create an account using the same username (if available) on all wikis you use. (2) Set the same e-mail address for all wikis you use, and follow the confirmation procedures. The password can be different; that won't matter. You can link your user pages by using the same interwiki syntax used on articles.

Everything seemed to proceed normally, but when I tried to save the article, and looked at it, certain of the changes are enclosed in dotted lines and they have no or few carriage returns. They run way off the right side of the page. I thought this was some artifact of the textual presentation but when I exited and came back, the article seems to be presented that way to the public. What did I do wrong? While I was writing, the paragraphs appeared normal. Separately, I registered and changed my preferences as prompted to do. I was asked for a signature. I don't have clue in the world what they are talking about. Is it an image file? Is it a link to my computer (I doubt that)? I am mystified. Now I am asking this question after clicking on "Ask your question" but the heading tells me I am editing some article. What is going on? Will anyone ever even see this?

Do you monitor "recent changes". Depend on your users to correct information as needed?My situation is i've setup a wiki within our company. I work in the Information Technology department. We've setup a wiki to serve as a knowledge base where all of our many technology teams can go to for answers. But we havent fully implemented yet, we are selling our case to management and they want it to be highly regulated and controlled, rather than a collaborative work like wiki's are supposed to be.I told them to go to wikipedia because "it just works" and I dont know how to explain it. But I was wondering, does wikipedia have any policies in place on how to monitor content?-matt.edlhuber AT aurora DOT orgA surprising number of measures are in place, ranging from RC Patrol to Wikignomes. Thanks to diligent enforcement of policies like no original research and Verifiability, random "joke" entries are often removed within a few minutes -- in a world where we can't readily prove our identity, we must cite reliable sources to find credibility. Beyond that, it's important to remember good faith -- every article was written by someone, and probably by a multitiude of editors; most of these editors care about the time they put into these articles, and they don't want to see that work ruined. So we have the watchlist, which allows us to easily keep track of changes to various articles. We don't need any overarching system to watch every article, because we instead have a decentralized army, with each page being watched by a few people. Suppose you have a wiki with 1,000 articles and 50 regular editors -- each editor need watch only 20 articles for every page to be watched. That's not as much trouble as it sounds; many pages, especially active ones, are watched by quite a few people; I myself have a watchlist of over 200 articles, and I know of some sysops who watch over 1,000. If it's really a problem, we can always protect pages. Hope that helps you some, and good luck.:) Luna Santin 19:20, 3 August 2006 (UTC)In a company setting, if users were to required to have usernames, all edits they make can be retraced to them as is custom on a regular wiki. In the remote case an employee wants to mess with the wiki, it's easy to figure out who did the messing by reading the entry's edit history. No regulation or control needed. Just make sure only reliable employees can access the thing. - Mgm|(talk) 21:43, 3 August 2006 (UTC)To sell it in an intranet setting, you should understand and work with the concerns of management. Their world view is one that is likely to avoid things that are cool, rather than embrace them, and you have to present from their perspective. I would make a case which depends on (1) accountability: compulsory use of usernames, centrally administered or distributed by e-mail [not the Wikipedia model]; (2) visibility, through the history, providing a complete audit trail. Managers love that. Don't stress it's just like Wikipedia, since some press coverage will have presented Wikipedia as an unreliable source, rightly or wrongly. Rather, stress that it will use the same software, but be set up for full accountability and auditability. (3) Stress also that it means that information can be distributed at lower cost, (4) will never be lost due to misfiling and (5) will be available in all situations including emergencies (make sure to include contingency plans!). Notinasnaid 08:34, 4 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] Famous PersonsIf I typed a search for a famous person such as Tom Cruise on Wikipedia I'd get information on him from when and where he was born to his Oprah appearance and the movies he's done in between. He's famous for movies and his antics during interviews. My question is what is famous?I ask this because I frequented a site called The Student Center and it is a forum based website. There people posted while interacting with others all over the world. I posted there for a total of about 2 years and my user name became very well known. It's so well known that it would be hard to find someone who wouldn't have heard of it on that site. You can Google it and you will find that in all (but two occasions where someone else used it to mock) the times it is used it is used by me and for me. But on that site it was very famous that I could start arguments or discussion based on the fact I said something (posted it). Someone else could have said (posted) the same thing and be ignored.My friend frequents your site a lot and I had asked him if he could write an article (objectively cause he is that good) on my user name for that site. He told me that this site can't be used for self promotion and such. I understand that this site is to be used to write things objectively because otherwise the site would be spammed with crap about people and it would be chaotic. I got that.So I ask if a famous person is someone that just acts like a different person for money, someone that gives their opinion in an open forum such as court, or a person that is paid to talk on the radio for hours about their opinion....than cannot a famous person also be someone that can stir up internet users on a site with saying the most mundane things and not be paid? I could not post a single thing without everyone knowing what it was I posted and where it was.I have a total of 104,000 posts. I lost 40,000 due to events that people that did not like me. So I would actually have close to 150,000 posts. That's a lot of time spent on the internet and on a single site. People did not know how it was done. I sometimes don't know how it was done and I'm the one that did it. No where else is there someone that has that amount of post on any site.It's not that this is a great feat and should be praised and documented as awesome as a basketball star that shoots from half court and gets a swoosh. It's that due to recent events on that site I was kicked off because of a huge lie about me. Yes I understand that this site is NOT for anything similar to propaganda and such. I get that. This is why I asked my friend to do it. He is my friend and he's a good friend but of all the people that I know that would do it he's the one that would take painstaking assurance that he was being objective and not bias for me.So what is famous? Can you be famous on the internet (as lame as that sounds there are famous people who use videos for that 15 minutes why not words?)?Thank you for reading and answering.We have numerous policies and essays on notability.

Reinyday, 08:00, 4 August 2006 (UTC)I'm afraid that's not even very notable. I just checked: in the world outside Wikipedia, I have around 100,000 posts to various discussion forums and usenet: mostly technical replies, not chat. I don't say this to get any credit, there are lots of very active people on the internet, and my posts don't even approach that. In forums where you can just chat, someone who puts in a lot of "me too!" and "yeah!" replies could easily rack up a million in a few years. But this isn't really an achievement.

Most of the images I create myself with hardware and software at my house although I create them I don't own the copyright (ie. movie posters) so I list the film company or production company that does own them and give their website as well.

I reverted his or her edits, but feel a experienced user adding something so akin to vandalism ought to warrant a more severe reprocussion. How would you suggest I proceed? --jwandersTalk 20:35, 4 August 2006 (UTC)Perhaps you could add a {{test1}} template to the user's talk page, informing him that such edits are inappropriate? If the user continues and becomes an obvious vandal, then you will have justification for a warning or for getting an admin involved. (whoops, forgot to sign) Keakealani Poke Mecontribs 20:57, 4 August 2006 (UTC)As a note, it appears that edit is a copy-paste from Encyclopedia damatica, and thus would be plagiarism and possibly intended trolling.

Keakealani Poke Mecontribs 21:12, 4 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] Essays and namespacesI'm thinking of writing an essay on bad arguments I see a lot at AfD (and to a lesser extent other *fDs) and was wondering if there's any rules as regards adding the essay to the Wikipedia: namespace versus creating it in my user space. I'd prefer to add it to the Wikipedia namespace (thus allowing the creation of the oft used WP:ILIKEIT shortcut) and was wondering if there'd be any problems with that. --Daduzi talk 21:34, 4 August 2006 (UTC)Well you can create the soft link anyway wherever the page is. Bear in mind though that the soft redirects are actually in the Article namespace and are not a seperate namespace in themsleves. You could write it in either namespace and have the softlink to it but Ithink most people put essays in their user space - at least until people start to take a wide interest! (I create them in my user space anyway:D ) --Errant Tmorton166(Talk)(Review me) 21:44, 4 August 2006 (UTC)You can create an essay in the Wikipedia namespace.

I think that might have the answer you seek. ViridaeTalk 11:58, 5 August 2006 (UTC)That page has more information on starting new WikiProjects than what the current ones actually do, so I'll try to give a brief explanation. They most often contain advice on how to edit their particular family of pages and other useful information, lists of participants, and to-do lists. Some have more than others, generally depending on their scope - to pick one at random, Wikiproject Novels is of suitably broad scope that they have their own 'current tasks' pane like the one at the community portal. There's also WikiProjects dedicated to general clerical tasks, such as managing categories, cleanup, and even standardising succession boxes (that seems to be the newest one in that category). Basically, if you're interested in a specific subject, or you know of an article that could use some specialist attention, the WikiProjects are a good place to go. Looking over Wikipedia:List of WikiProjects will give you a good overview of what there is available. --Sam Blanning(talk) 12:05, 5 August 2006 (UTC)Also, don't forget the list of proposed projects, as maybe you can develop a project from almost nothing, but it really suits for you. -- Imoeng 12:11, 5 August 2006 (UTC)[edit] ADDITING OUR SITE IN WIKIPEDIADEAR SIR,WE ARE THE MANUFACTURERS OF THERMOL & THERMACT RANGE OF PRODUCTS FUNCTIONING AS ADDITIVES FOR BOTH SOLID AND LIQUID FUEL ADDITIVES.OUR WEB SITE - WWW.ABHITECH.BIZ E-MAIL: removed to prevent spam KINDLY LET US KNOW HOW TO UPLOAD THE SITE TO YOUR WEBSITE AND KEEP A LINK IN THE SAME.REGARDS.AMUL EXECUTIVEFirst, please note our Wikipedia:Verifiability, Wikipedia:No original research, and Wikipedia:Notability policies, which all articles must abide by.

An article is usually no longer a stub when its over 9-10 sentences long, and has a few if not several section headers, including the see also, references, notes and external liks. As for category tags, I think if you just browse this page you should be ok. I'm not sure if there is actually a list of cats. SynergeticMaggot 18:52, 5 August 2006 (UTC)For stubs, you may want to see this guideline. It gives some definitions and also when it is appropriate to remove the tag. For categories, I generally look at similar articles and am able to find categories. Another way is to start looking in a broader category. It contains subcategories and so on.

The third should be blanked because it stretches the page width, and the fourth should be blanked because it's a load of nonsense which includes a page error thanks to the <ref></ref> tags (I think). I've done all three. --Sam Blanning(talk) 00:25, 6 August 2006 (UTC)The third one is a talk page of a page which does not exist, so it qualifies for speedy deletion under CSD G8.
