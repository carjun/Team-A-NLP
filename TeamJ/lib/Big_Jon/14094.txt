Octuplets mom wins in court against hounding by strangers wanting to oversee her children's finances    Orange :  CA :  USA|Jan 09, 2010By AnneHart        2 0     Views: 696      According to a January 8, 2010 Associated Press article, a Santa Ana, California appeals court ruled in favor of octuplets mother Nadya SulemanNadya Suleman on January 7, 2010. The 4th District court of Appeal labeled the petition, an "unprecedented, meritless effort by a stranger." Check out the site, "Octomom Nadya Suleman Films New Documentary to Fund Family - ABC News."  In a November 24, 2009 excluvise interview with Good Morning America (TV show), Nadya Suleman told Good Morning America that "she may have more kids someday," according to ABC News. Suleman reported from her La Habra, CA home in an exclusive interview with Good Morning America that, ""I've basically been a science experiment for the last 10 years." Suleman put her family in front of cameras earlier in the fall of 2009 for a one-hour documentary that has already aired in the United Kingdom and will air in the United States as well. The production company has the option to produce more installments and will likely resume shooting around Christmas. Check out the article, "Octomom Trademarks Nickname for Line of Baby Clothes - ABC News." According to the ABC article, "Octomom Nadya Suleman Films New Documentary to Fund Family - ABC News," Suleman earned an estimated $250,000 for the first year of access to her family. However, the article reported that, "Half of that money went straight to the care of her children, all of whom were born through in vitro fertilization." She told ABC, "it's the only way to support her enormous family." Now the court has finally decided in her favor. The strangers, 'er, advocates for the children, (in this editorial opinion) had called for an independent guardian to monitor her children's finances. But the court directed an Orange County probate court to "vacate its order for an investigation into the family's finances." See the site, "Octomom | TMZ.com."  The mother of the world's only surving octuplets has been hounded by lawyers and the public since the in-vitro birth of her children. On one hand, the advocates for children in the entertainment industry argued that her children were vulnerable. Of course children have to be protected. But evidence presented in court showed that the mother of the octuplets did no financial misconduct. And the court decided in the mother's favor. The lawyers and some of the public demanded that an independent guardian should be appointed to make sure the financial interests of the children were maintained in the best interests of the kids until their adulthood. However, the appeals court said the probate judge erred because the advocate failed to show that Suleman was engaging in financial misconduct. Suleman gave birth to octuplets on Jan. 26, 2009. The medical curiosity of their delivery turned to public outrage because she already had six other children, all born through in-vitro fertilization. She was at the time single and an unemployed college graduate in psychology.  Instead of offers of financial, food, or diaper help from the big corporations, or employment offers with child care included from wealthier segment of the public or commerce, unwanted hate mail and criticism ensued by much of the public. Too many people came out of the wood work to control the mother rather than to offer help. Instead of offering child care with no strings attached, the public tried to take her power away, her ability to raise her children away, under the disguise of protecting the children. From what? There was no misconduct of finances, according to the court. Was it all because she didn't have a "man' in the house bringing home the bacon for her to fry up in the pan, she was condemned with a symbolic scarlett letter of in-virtro fertilization? Was it a mistake to have fourteen children without a husband or an income and depend on others? On the government? The mother of fourteen sought solutions instead where she wouldn't have to ask for help from the government. She earned money to support her family the way her education prepared her for, by showing the public what it's like to walk in her shoes. Did the reality show create empathy, compassion, and commitment or connections to her community? Did it land her a steady income? The public found out she had used Social Security disability payments and food stamps for three of her children. And the public's rage increased with it was revealed publicly that some of the disability money was spent on in-vitro fertilizations, even though she had children with disabilities at home. The fertilizations resulted in a total of 14 living children. It's time for the public to stop calling her crazy. She is providing financially for her children and has not engaged in financial misconduct. She has been compared to others that wanted to have reality TV shows. The public on the other hand, thinks what extremes will some people go to in order to get an income, a reality show, attention, or help? The reality is, the woman has an income, and should not be annoyed by the public just because she doesn't have a man in the house to pay the bills. Basically, as long as the children are safe, well-cared for, and sound, she should be left to solve her problems by her wits. She does have a college degree in psychology and has been offered several months ago, a reality TV show by a British production company that wants to follow her children on camera until they reach age 18. People are curious, though what's happened to her, now that she has been out of the news for many months. Her children are a year older. Is it the public's business what happened to her and her children? What's your opinion? Yes or No? What would she like the public to do--butt out? Or take an interest in making sure her children are safe, nourished, and happy?        1 of 2              Octomom discusses her son's autismuTube video      AnneHart is based in Sacramento, California, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (56.7%) Canada (32.6%) United Kingdom (5.5%) Venezuela (2.4%) 6 other countries (1.4%)           READ MORE: Octomom wins in court, entertainment-news, Orange, Nadya Suleman, Suleman octuplets, Nadia, probate court, multiple births, Entertainment Culture, social issues, financial misconduct   More News From: Orange :  CA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 2            Reply  Posted By     George Vieto|12 monthsagoThank you for this news report.
