Bush administration, these controversial attacks were called a part of the US' "War on Terrorism" and sought to defeat the Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants who were thought to have found a safe haven in Pakistan.[2] Most of these attacks are on targets in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border in Northwest Pakistan.These strikes are mostly carried out by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operated remotely from Creech Air Force Base and have continued under the Presidency of Barack Obama.[3][4] Generally the UAVs used are MQ-1 Predator and more recently MQ-9 Reaper firing AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. The drones have become a weapon of choice for the United States in the fight against al-Qaeda.[5] Some media refer to the series of attacks as a "drone war".[6][7] Pakistan's government publicly condemns these attacks but has secretly shared intelligence with Americans[8] and also allegedly allowed the drones to operate from Shamsi airfield in Pakistan.[9]Contents1 Statistics2 Timeline2.1 200420072.2 20082.3 20092.3.1 January to June2.3.2 July to December2.4 20102.4.1 January to March2.4.2 April to June2.4.3 July to September2.4.4 October to December2.5 20112.5.1 January to March3 US viewpoint4 Pakistani response5 United Nations human rights concerns6 Interviews with people from Waziristan7 Drone weapons8 See also9 References10 External links[edit] StatisticsUS Drone Strike Statistics[1]YearNumber of Drone StrikesNumber Killed (Min)Number Killed (Max)200414520052672006223232007453742008342632962009534137092010118595993201141922Total2181,3762,129[edit] Timeline[edit] 20042007June 18, 2004: 5 including Nek Muhammad Wazir killed in a strike near Wana, South Waziristan.[10]May 14, 2005: 2 killed including Haitham al-Yemeni in a strike near the Afghan border in North Waziristan.[11]November 30, 2005: Al-Qaeda's 3rd in command, Abu Hamza Rabia killed in an attack by CIA drones in Asoray, near Miranshah, the capital of North Waziristan along with 4 other militants.[12]January 13, 2006: Damadola airstrike kills 18 civilians in Bajaur area but misses Ayman al-Zawahri.October 30, 2006 Chenagai airstrike allegedly aimed at Ayman al-Zawahri destroys a madrassa in Bajaur area and kills 70-80 civilians.January 16, 2007: Up to 30 Taliban killed in a drone strike in Salamat Keley, Zamazola, South Waziristan.[13]April 26, 2007: 4 killed in the village of Saidgi in North Waziristan[14]June 19, 2007: 30 killed in the village of Mami Rogha in North Waziristan[15]November 2, 2007: 5 killed in an attack on a madrasah in North Waziristan[16][edit] 2008January 29, 2008: Abu Laith al-Libi killed in a strike in North Waziristan along with 11 other militants.[17][18]February 27, 2008: 12 people killed in a strike near Kalosha village in South Waziristan.[19]March 18, 2008: 16 killed in a strike in South Waziristan[20]May 14, 2008: 12 including Abu Sulayman Al-Jazairi killed near village of Damadola, Bajaur.[21][22]June 14, 2008: US drones fired three missiles at a potential hideout of TTP leader Meshud, killing one person.[23]July 28, 2008: Midhat Mursi and 5 other Al-Qaeda operatives killed in South Waziristan.[18]August 12, 2008: Nine killed in four strikes in the area near Angore Adda in South Waziristan during a meeting of militants.[24]August 13, 2008: US drone strike on a compound run by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar killed Taliban commander Abdul Rehman, along with Islam Wazir, three Turkmen, and several Arab fighters.

According to Koh, the US is involved in an armed conflict with al-Qaida, the Taliban, and their affiliates and therefore may use force consistent with self-defense under international law.[286]US officials stated in March 2009 that the Predator strikes had killed nine of al-Qaeda's 20 top commanders. The officials added that many top Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders, as a result of the strikes, had fled to Quetta or even further to Karachi.[287]Some US politicians have condemned the drone strikes. US Congressman Dennis Kucinich asserted that the United States was violating international law by carrying out strikes against a country that never attacked the United States.[288]US military reports asserted that al-Qaeda is being slowly but systematically routed because of these attacks, and that they have served to sow the seeds of uncertainty and discord among their ranks. They also claimed that the drone attacks have addled and confused the Taliban, and have led them to turn against each other.[289] In July 2009 it was reported that (according to US officials) Osama Bin Laden's son Saad bin Laden was believed to have been killed in a drone attack earlier in the year.[290]During a protest against drone attacks, in an event sponsored by Nevada Desert Experience, Father Louie Vitale, Kathy Kelly, Stephen Kelly, SJ, Eve Tetaz, John Dear, and others were arrested outside Creech Air Force Base on Wednesday April 9, 2009.[291][292]In May 2009 it was reported that the USA was sharing drone intelligence with Pakistan.[293] Leon Panetta reiterated on May 19, 2009 that the US intended to continue the drone attacks.[294]On July 14, 2009, Daniel L. Byman of the Brookings Institution stated that although accurate data on the results of drone strikes is difficult to obtain, it seemed that ten civilians had died in the drone attacks for every militant killed.[295] He suggested that the real answer to halting al-Qaeda's activity in Pakistan will be long-term support of Pakistan's counterinsurgency efforts.[296]In December 2009 expansion of the drone attacks was authorized by President Barack Obama to parallel the decision to send 30,000 more American troops to Afghanistan.[297] Senior US officials are reportedly pushing for extending the strikes into Quetta in Balochistan against the Quetta Shura.[298] Speaking at a news conference in Islamabad on January 7, 2010 Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman stated the drone attacks were effective and would continue but stated that US would make greater efforts to prevent collateral damage.[299] In an effort to strenghthen trust with Pakistan 'US sharing drone surveillance data with Pakistan, says Mike Mullen '[300] US defence budget for 2011 asked for a 75% increase in funds to enhance the drone operations.[301]The Associated Press (AP) noted that Barack Obama apparently expanded the scope and increased the aggressiveness of the drone campaign against militants in Pakistan after taking office. According to the news agency, the US increased strikes against the Pakistani Taliban, which earned favor from the Pakistani government, resulting in increased cooperation from Pakistani intelligence services. Also, the Obama administration toned down the US government's public rhetoric against Islamic terrorism, garnering better cooperation from other Islamic governments. Furthermore, with the drawdown of the war in Iraq, more drones, support personnel, and intelligence assets became available for the campaigns in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Since Obama took office, according to the AP, the number of drones operated by the CIA over Afghanistan and Pakistan doubled.[302] A May 2010 Reuters report quoted unnamed counterterrorism officials who speculated that the Obama administration's closure of the secret CIA interrogation centers and intent to close the Guantanamo Bay prison was a direct influence on the expansion of the drone targeted killings. According to the officials, the killings are necessary because there is no longer any place to put captured terrorists.[303]A study called 'The Year of the Drone" published in February 2010 by New America Foundation found that in a total of 114 drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and early 2010 approximately between 834 and 1,216 individuals had been killed, about two thirds of whom were thought to be militants and one third were civilians.[304][edit] Pakistani responseShamsi airbase in 2006, reported to show three Predator drones.[305]Pakistan has repeatedly protested these attacks as they are an infringement of its sovereignty and because civilian deaths have also resulted, including women and children, which has further angered the Pakistani government and people.[306][307][308] General David Petraeus was told in November 2008 that these strikes were unhelpful.[309] However on October 4, 2008 The Washington Post reported that there was a secret deal between the US and Pakistan allowing these drone attacks.[310] US Senator Dianne Feinstein said in February 2009: As I understand it, these are flown out of a Pakistani base.[311] Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi denied that this was true.[312]Between November 2008 and January 2009 Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy (AIRRA), a think tank of researchers and activists from FATA and NWFP conducted a survey of the public opinion about the drone strikes in Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Five teams of five researchers each interviewed 550 people from all walks of life.[297] Based on the responses the researchers concluded 'The popular notion outside the Pakhtun belt that a large majority of the local population supports the Taliban movement lacks substance'. Most people thought that the drone attacks were accurate and did not lead to anti-American sentiment and were effective in damaging the militants. In addition the locals wanted the Pakistani forces to also target the militants.[313] According to Farhat Taj a member of AIRRA the drones have never killed any civilians. Some people in Waziristan compare the drones to Ababils , the holy swallows sent by God to avenge Abraha, the invader of the Khana Kaaba.[314]In September 28, a spokesman for the Pakistani army condemned Washington's killing of Pakistani civilians and warned of retaliatory action: "Border violations by US-led forces in Afghanistan, which have killed scores of Pakistani civilians, would no longer be tolerated, and we have informed them that we reserve the right to self defense and that we will retaliate if the US continues cross-border attacks."[315]The British newspaper The Times stated on February 18, 2009 that the CIA was using Shamsi airfield, 190miles (310 km) southwest of Quetta and 30miles (48 km) from the Afghan border, as its base for drone operations. Safar Khan, a journalist based in the area near Shamsi, told the Times, "We can see the planes flying from the base. The area around the base is a high-security zone and no one is allowed there."[316] [316] Top US officials confirmed to Fox News Channel that Shamsi airfield had been used by the CIA to launch the drones since 2002.[305]The drone attacks continue, despite repeated requests made by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari through different channels.[317][318] Baitullah Mehsud while claiming responsibility for the 2009 Lahore police academy attacks, stated that it was in retaliation for the drone attacks.[319] According to The Daily Telegraph, Pakistani intelligence has agreed to secretly provide information to the United States on Mehsud's and his militants' whereabouts while publicly the Pakistani government will continue to condemn the attacks.[320] According to Pakistani authorities, from January 14, 2006 to April 8, 2009, 60 U.S. strikes against Pakistan killed 701 people, of which 14 were Al-Qaeda militants and 687 innocent civilians.[321]On April 28, 2009 Pakistan's consul general to the US, Aqil Nadeem, asked the US to hand over control of its drones in Pakistan to his government. Said Nadeem, "Do we want to lose the war on terror or do we want to keep those weapons classified? If the American government insists on our true cooperation, then they should also be helping us in fighting those terrorists."[322] President Zardari has also requested that Pakistan be given control over the drones but this has been rejected by the US who are worried that Pakistanis will leak information about targets to militants.[68] In December 2009 Pakistan's Defence minister Ahmad Mukhtar acknowledged that Americans were using Shamsi airfield but stated that Pakistan was not satisfied with payments for using the facility.[323]In an analysis published in Daily Times on January 2, 2010 author Farhat Taj challenged the view that the local people of Waziristan were against the drone attacks. Author states on the basis of personal interviews with people in Waziristan that the locals in Waziristan support the attacks and see the drones as their 'liberators' from the clutches of Taliban and Pakistan's Intelligence agencies. She further challenged the government of Pakistan to provide accurate figures about the 'civilian' casualties and tell what methodology was used to collect this data. According to her 'The people of Waziristan are suffering a brutal kind of occupation under the Taliban and al Qaeda. It is in this context that they would welcome anyone, Americans, Israelis, Indians or even the devil, to rid them of the Taliban and al Qaeda.'[324] In response to this analysis Irfan Husain writing in Dawn agreed with her assessment and called for more drone attacks. He wrote 'We need to wake up to the reality that the enemy has grown very strong in the years we temporized and tried to do deals with them. Clearly, we need allies in this fight. Howling at the moon is not going to get us the cooperation we so desperately need. A solid case can be made for more drone attacks, not less.[325]In December 2010 the CIA's Station Chief in Islamabad operating under the alias Jonathan Banks was hastily pulled from the country.[326][327] Lawsuits filed by families of victims of drone strikes had named Banks as a defendant, he had been receiving death threats, and a Pakistani journalist whose brother and son died in a drone strike called for prosecuting Banks for murder.[328][329][edit] United Nations human rights concernsOn June 3, 2009, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) delivered a report sharply critical of US tactics. The report asserted that the US government has failed to keep track of civilian casualties of its military operations, including the drone attacks, and to provide means for citizens of affected nations to obtain information about the casualties and any legal inquests regarding them.[330] Any such information held by the U.S. military is allegedly inaccessible to the public due to the high level of secrecy surrounding the drone attacks program.[331] The US representative at UNHRC has argued that the UN investigator for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions does not have jurisdiction over US military actions,[330] while another US diplomat claimed that the US military is investigating any wrongdoing and doing all it can to furnish information about the deaths.[332]On October 27, 2009 UNHRC investigator Philip Alston called on the US to demonstrate that it was not randomly killing people in violation of international law through its use of drones on the Afghan border. Alston criticized the US's refusal to respond to date to the UN's concerns. Said Alston, "Otherwise you have the really problematic bottom line, which is that the Central Intelligence Agency is running a program that is killing significant numbers of people and there is absolutely no accountability in terms of the relevant international laws."[333]On June 2, 2010 Alston's team released a report on its investigation into the drone strikes, criticizing the United States for being, "the most prolific user of targeted killings" in the world. Alston, however, acknowledged that the drone attacks may be justified under the right to self-defense. He called on the US to be more open about the program. Alston's report was submitted to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights the following day.[334][edit] Interviews with people from WaziristanBetween November 2008 and January 2009 Pakistani Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy conducted a survey of the public opinion about the drone strikes in Federally Administered Tribal Areas. 5 teams of 5 researchers each interviewed a total of 550 people from all walks of life. Most people thought that the drone attacks were accurate and did not lead to anti-American sentiment and were effective in damaging the militants.[297]In an analysis published in Daily Times (Pakistan) on January 2, 2010 Farhat Taj, a research fellow at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Gender Research, University of Oslo and a member of Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy discussed the issue of drone attacks with hundreds of people of Waziristan. She claims that they see the US drone attacks as their liberators from the clutches of Islamist militiants into which, they say, their state has wilfully thrown them. She claims that estimates about civilian casualties in the US and Pakistani media are wrong because after every attack Islamist militiants cordon off the area and no one, including the local villagers, is allowed to come even near the targeted place. The militants themselves collect the bodies, bury the dead and then issue the statement that all of them were innocent civilians. However, according to the people of Waziristan, the only civilians who have been killed so far in the drone attacks are women or children of the militants in whose houses/compounds they hold meetings. But that used to happen in the past and now they dont hold meetings at places where women and children of the militants reside. In one case when the funeral procession of an Islamist commander was hit and some civilians were killed. But after the attack people got the excuse of not attending the funeral of slain militants or offering them food.Farhat Taj claims that locals usually appreciate drone attacks when they compare it with the Pakistan Armys attacks, which always result in collateral damage. People said that when a drone would hover over the skies, they wouldnt be disturbed and would carry on their usual business because they would be sure that it does not target the civilians, but the same people would run for shelter when a Pakistani jet would appear in the skies because of its indiscriminate firing. They say that even in the same compound only the exact room  where a high value target (HVT) is present  is targeted and others in the same compound are spared.[335]In response to this analysis Irfan Husain writing in Dawn agreed with Farhat Taj's assessment and called for more drone attacks. He wrote: "We need to wake up to the reality that the enemy has grown very strong in the years we temporized and tried to do deals with them. Clearly, we need allies in this fight. Howling at the moon is not going to get us the cooperation we so desperately need. A solid case can be made for more drone attacks, not less."[325][edit] Drone weaponsAccording to media reports, in 2009 or 2010 CIA drones began employing smaller missiles in airstrikes in Pakistan in order to reduce collateral damage, including civilian casualties. The new missiles, called the Small Smart Weapon or Scorpion, are reportedly about the size of a violin case (21inches long) and weigh 16kg. The missiles are used in combination with new technology to increase accuracy and expanded surveillance, including the use of small, unarmed drones about the size of "pizza platters" to exactly pinpoint the location of targets. The US hopes that civilian casualties will decrease, thereby decreasing public outrage over the missile strikes.[336][337][edit] See alsoDrone attacks in YemenTargeted killingTerrorism in PakistanList of terrorist incidents in Pakistan since 2001Violence in Pakistan 2006-09Operation Menu (the secret bombing of Laos during the Vietnam War)[edit] References^ a b The Year of the Drone An Analysis of U.S. Drone Strikes in Pakistan, 20042010^ a b The CIA's Silent War in Pakistan, TIME, 2009-06-01^ Strikes in Pakistan Underscore Obamas Options, The New York Times, 2009-01-23^ Shah, Saeed.
