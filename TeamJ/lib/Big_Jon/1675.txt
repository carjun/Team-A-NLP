It is the joint oldest team in Test cricket, having played in the first Test match in 1877 [2]. The team also plays One Day International cricket and Twenty20 International, participating in both the first ODI, against England in the 1970-71 season [3] and the first Twenty20 International, against New Zealand in the 2004-05 season [4], winning both games. The team mainly draws its players from teams playing in the Australian domestic competitions - the Sheffield Shield, the Australian Domestic One-Day Series and the Twenty20 Big Bash.The Australian team has played 730 Test matches, winning 341, losing 192, drawing 195 and tieing two.[2] Australia is ranked the number-one team overall in Test cricket in terms of overall wins, win-loss ratio and wins percentage. Australia is currently ranked fifth in the ICC Test Championship behind India, South Africa, England and Sri Lanka, and led the Test rankings for a record time of 73 months from 2003 to 2008.Australia have played 751 ODI matches, winning 464, losing 255, tieing eight and with 24 ending in no-result[3]. They have led the ICC ODI Championship since its inception for all but a period of 48 days in 2007. Australia have made six World Cup final appearances and have won the World Cup a record four times in total; 1987 Cricket World Cup, 1999 Cricket World Cup, 2003 Cricket World Cup & 2007 Cricket World Cup.The team is currently undefeated in 29 consecutive World Cup matches. Australia have also won the ICC Champions Trophy twice - in 2006 and in 2009 - making them the first and the only team to become back to back winners in the Champions Trophy tournaments. The team has also played 39 Twenty20 Internationals[4], making the final of the ICC World Twenty20 in 2010 before losing it to England.Contents1 History1.1 Early History1.2 Golden Age1.3 Cricket between the wars1.4 The Bradman Era1.5 Cricket after World War II1.6 1970s and onward1.7 Modern Era1.7.1 India1.7.2 Pakistani Tour 2004051.7.3 2005 Ashes1.7.4 ICC Super Series1.7.5 West Indies1.7.6 South Africa Tour1.7.7 Bangladesh Tour1.7.8 200607 Ashes1.7.9 200607 ODI season1.7.10 2007 World Cup1.7.11 Recent Seasons2 Team colours3 International grounds4 Personnel4.1 Coaching staff5 Test match records5.1 Team5.2 Appearances5.3 Batting5.4 Bowling5.5 Fielding and wicketkeeping6 One Day International records6.1 Team7 Tournament history8 Under the Southern Cross I Stand9 See also10 Notes11 External links[edit] HistoryThis article or section may be slanted towards recent events. Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective. (December 2010)1878 teamMain article: History of the Australian cricket team[edit] Early HistoryMain article: History of Australian cricket from 187677 to 1890The Australian cricket team participated in the first Test match at the MCG in 1877, defeating an English team by 45 runs, with Charles Bannerman making the first Test century, a score of 165 retired hurt. Test cricket, which only occurred between Australia and England at the time, was limited by the long distance between the two countries, which would take several months by sea. Despite Australia's much smaller population, the team was very competitive in early games, producing stars such as Jack Blackham, Billy Murdoch, Fred "The Demon" Spofforth, George Bonnor, Percy McDonnell, George Giffen and Charles "The Terror" Turner. Most cricketers at the time were either from New South Wales or Victoria, with the notable exception of George Giffen, the star South Australian all-rounder.A highlight of Australia's early history was the 1882 Test match against England at The Oval. In this match Fred Spofforth took 7/44 in the game's fourth innings to save the match by preventing England from making their 85-run target. After this match The Sporting Times, a major newspaper in London at the time, printed a mock obituary in which the death of English cricket was proclaimed and the announcement made that "the body was cremated and the ashes taken to Australia." This was the start of the famous Ashes series in which Australia and England play a Test match series to decide the holder of the Ashes. To this day, the contest is one of the fiercest rivalries in sport.[edit] Golden AgeMain article: History of Australian cricket from 189091 to 1900Main article: History of Australian cricket from 1900-01 to 1918The so-called 'Golden Age' of Australian test cricket occurred around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, with the team under the captaincy of Joe Darling, Monty Noble and Clem Hill winning eight of ten tours it participated in between the 1897-98 English tour of Australia and the 1910-11 South African tour of Australia. Outstanding batsman such as Joe Darling, Clem Hill, Reggie Duff, Syd Gregory, Warren Bardsley and Victor Trumper, brilliant all-rounders including Monty Noble, George Giffen, Harry Trott and Warwick Armstrong and excellent bowlers including Ernie Jones, Hugh Trumble, Tibby Cotter, Bill Howell, Jack Saunders and Bill Whitty, all helped Australia to become the dominant cricketing nation for most of this period.Victor Trumper became one of Australia's first sporting heroes, and was widely considered Australia's greatest batsman before Bradman and one of the most popular players. He played a record (at the time) number of tests at 48, and scored 3163 (another record) runs at a high for the time average of 39.04. His early death in 1915 at the age of 37 from kidney disease caused national mourning. The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, in its obituary for him, called him Australia's greatest batsman: "Of all the great Australian batsmen Victor Trumper was by general consent the best and most brilliant." [5]The years leading up to the start of World War I were marred by conflict between the players, led by Clem Hill, Victor Trumper and Frank Laver, the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket (formed in 1905), led by Peter McAlister, who were attempting to gain more control of tours from the players. This led to six leading players (the so-called "Big Six") walking out on the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England, with Australia fielding what was generally considered a second-rate side. This was the last series before the war, and no more cricket was played by Australia for eight years, with Tibby Cotter being killed in Palestine during the war.[edit] Cricket between the warsMain article: History of Australian cricket from 1918-19 to 1930Test cricket resumed in the 1920/21 season in Australia with a touring English team, captained by Johnny Douglas losing all five Tests to Australia, captained by the "Big Ship" Warwick Armstrong. Several players from before the war, including Warwick Armstrong, Charlie Macartney, Charles Kelleway, Warren Bardsley and the wicket-keeper Sammy Carter, were instrumental in the team's success, as well as new players Herbie Collins, Jack Ryder, Bert Oldfield, the spinner Arthur Mailey and the so-called "twin destroyers" Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald. The team continued its success on the 1921 Tour of England, winning three out of the five Tests in Warwick Armstrong's last series. The side was on the whole inconsistent in the latter half of the 1920s, losing its first home Ashes series since the 1911-12 season in 1928-29.[edit] The Bradman EraMain article: History of Australian cricket from 193031 to 1945The 1930 Tour of England heralded a new age of success for the Australian team. The team, led by Bill Woodfull - the "Great Un-bowlable" - featured legends of the game including Bill Ponsford, Stan McCabe, Clarrie Grimmett and the young pair of Archie Jackson and Don Bradman. Bradman was the outstanding batsman of the series, scoring a record 974 runs, including one century, two double centuries and one triple century, a massive score of 334 at Leeds which including 309 runs in a day. Jackson died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 three years later, after playing eight tests. The team was widely considered unstoppable, winning nine of its next ten Tests.The 1932-33 England tour of Australia is considered one of the most infamous episodes of cricket, due to the England team's use of bodyline, where captain Douglas Jardine instructed his bowlers Bill Voce and Harold Larwood to bowl fast, short-pitched deliveries aimed at the bodies of the Australian batsmen. The tactic, although effective, was widely considered by Australian crowds as vicious and unsporting. Injuries to Bill Woodfull, who was struck over the heart, and Bert Oldfield, who received a fractured skull (although from a non-Bodyline ball), exacerbated the situation, almost causing a full-scale riot from the 50 000 fans at the Adelaide Oval for the Third Test. The conflict almost escalated into a diplomatic incident between the two countries, as leading Australian political figures, including the Governor of South Australia, Alexander Hore-Ruthven, protested to their English counterparts. The series ended in a 4-1 win for England, but the Bodyline tactics used were banned the year after.The Australian team managed to overcame the damaging series, winning their next tour of England in 1934. The team was led by Bill Woodfull on his final tour, and was notably dominated by Ponsford and Bradman, who twice put on partnerships of over 380 runs, with Bradman once again scoring a triple-century at Leeds. The bowling was dominated by the spin pair of Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett, who took 53 wickets between them, with O'Reilly twice taking seven wicket hauls.Sir Donald Bradman is widely considered the greatest batsman of all time.[6][7] He dominated the sport from 1930 until his retirement in 1948, setting new records for the highest score in a test innings (334 vs England at Headingley in 1930), the most number of runs (6996), the most number of centuries (29), the most number of double centuries and the greatest Test and first-class batting averages. His record for the highest Test batting average - 99.94 - has never been beaten. It is almost 40 runs above the next highest average. He would have finished with an average of over 100 runs per innings if he had not been dismissed for a duck in his last Test. He was knighted in 1949 for services to cricket. He is generally considered one of Australia's greatest sporting heroes.Test cricket was again interrupted by war, with the last Test series in 1938 made notable by Len Hutton making a world record 364 for England, with Chuck Fleetwood-Smith conceding 298 runs in England's world record total of 7-903. Ross Gregory, a notable young batsman who played two Tests before the war, was killed in the war.[edit] Cricket after World War IIMain article: History of Australian cricket from 1945-46 to 1960The team continued its success after the end of the Second World War, with the first Test (also Australia's first against New Zealand) being played in the 1945-46 season against New Zealand. Australia was by far the most successful team of the 1940s, being undefeated throughout the decade, winning two Ashes series against England and its first Test series against India. The team capitalised on its aging stars Bradman, Sid Barnes, Bill Brown and Lindsay Hassett while new talent, including Ian Johnson, Don Tallon, Arthur Morris, Neil Harvey, Bill Johnston and the fast bowling pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, who all made their debut in the latter half of the 1940s, and were to form the basis of the team for a good part of the next decade. The team that Don Bradman led to England in 1948 gained the moniker The Invincibles, after going through the tour with losing a single game. Of 31 first-class games played during the tour, they won 23 and drew 8, including winning the five match Test series 4-0, with one draw. The tour was particularly notably for the Fourth Test of the series, in which Australia won by seven wickets chasing a target of 404, setting a new record for the highest runchase in Test cricket, with Arthur Morris and Bradman both scoring centuries, as well as for the final Test in the series, Bradman's last, where he finished with a duck in his last innings after needing only four runs to secure a career average of 100.Australia was less successful in the 1950s, losing three consecutive Ashes series to England, including a horrendous 1956 Tour of England, where the 'spin twins' Laker and Lock destroyed Australia, taking 61 wickets between them, including Laker taking 19 wickets in the game (a first-class record) at Leeds, a game dubbed Laker's Match.However, the team rebounded to win five consecutive series in the latter half of the 1950s, first under the leadership of Ian Johnson, then Ian Craig and Richie Benaud. The series against the West Indies in the 1960-61 season was notable for the Tied Test in the first game at The Gabba, which was the first in Test cricket. Australia ended up winning the series 2-1 after a hard fought series that was praised for its excellent standards and sense of fair-play. Stand-out players in that series as well as through the early part of the 1960s were Richie Benaud, who took a then-record number of wickets as a leg-spinner, and who also captained Australia in 28 Tests, including 24 without defeat; Alan Davidson, who became the first player to take 10 wickets and make 100 runs in the same game in the first Test, and was also a notable fast-bowler; Bob Simpson, who also later captained Australia for two different periods of time; Colin McDonald, the first-choice opening batsman for most of the 1950s and early '60s; Norm O'Neill, who made 181 in the Tied Test; Neil Harvey, towards the end of his long career; and Wally Grout, an excellent wicket-keeper who died at the age of 41.[edit] 1970s and onwardAustralia continued its success up until the 1980s, built mainly around the likes of Bob Simpson (cricketer), the Chappell brothers, Dennis Lillee, and Rod Marsh. The 1980s was a period of relative mediocrity after the turmoil caused by World Series Cricket and the subsequent retirement of several key players, and it was not until the captaincy of Allan Border that the team was restructured. The 1990s and early 21st century were arguably Australia's most successful period, unbeaten in all Ashes series played bar the famous 2005 series and achieving a hat-trick of World Cups. This success has been attributed to the restructuring of the team and system by Border, successive shrewd captains, and the effectiveness of several key players, most notably Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Steve Waugh, Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting. In recent years however, following the retirement of most of this group of players, Australia has lost series to both India and England and has dropped to fifth place in the ICC Test Championship rankings.[edit] Modern Era[edit] IndiaAustralian captain Steve Waugh referred to India as the "Final Frontier", as that was the only place where Australia hadn't won a series in over thirty years. Australia lost in the 2001 series 21 and when India came to Australia for Waugh's farewell series in 200304, they drew the series 11 and came close to winning it after scoring a national record 705 but not enforcing the follow-on.However, later in the year, the side (captained by Adam Gilchrist) won in India for the first time in 35 years. The Australians won this series 21 (with one match rained out on the last day).[edit] Pakistani Tour 200405The 200405 summer season in Australia was against the touring Pakistani cricket team which Australia won convincingly, several matches ending on the 4th day (of 5). The first Test of 2005 ended with: AUS 568 and 1/62 v PAK 304 and 325; Ponting made 207 in the first innings, laying to rest a minor media issue of him not making a Test 100 in his first season as captain.[edit] 2005 AshesThe 2005 Ashes tour to England became a watershed event in Australian cricket when, for the first time since 198687 a Test series was lost to the old enemy England, and The Ashes were thus surrendered. The summer started with four defeats in one week in one day matches (to England in a Twenty20 match, Somerset in a warm up match, and then Bangladesh and England in successive One Day Internationals). Australia and England tied the final match of the first One Day International series, before Australia won the second series 21.The first Test match at Lord's was a convincing victory for Australia, with Glenn McGrath impressing in particular. Captain Ricky Ponting afterwards famously said: Weve a very good chance of winning 50. However at the second Test at Edgbaston star bowler Glenn McGrath was ruled out by an ankle injury after stepping on a ball in the practice nets; Ponting put England in to bat on a fair batting wicket (England scored 407 runs on the first day) and England eventually won a pulsating match by two runs and so leveled the series. England dominated the rain-affected third Test at Old Trafford, but a fine rearguard innings by Ponting just saved Australia on the final day and the match was drawn. In the fourth Test at Trent Bridge Australia were again outplayed and forced to follow-on for the first time in 191 Test matches and eighteen years. England struggled in their second innings but eventually got the 129 runs they needed to win, losing seven wickets in the process. Australia needed to win the fifth and final Test at The Oval to level the series and retain the Ashes but were hampered by bad weather, a strong England bowling performance on the fourth day and England's excellent batting (led by Kevin Pietersen and tailender Ashley Giles) on the final day before the match ended in a draw, handing England a 21 series win.Ageing stars such as Hayden, Gilchrist, Martyn, Gillespie and Kasprowicz underperformed in the tour with Gillespie being subsequently dropped for new and younger talent. On the other hand Shane Warne, who took 40 wickets and scored 249 runs, gave an all-round good performance. Members of the old guard (Ponting, Langer, Lee and McGrath) also played well.[edit] ICC Super SeriesThe ICC (International Cricket Council) sanctioned a test and three-match one-day series for 2005. This series was to be played between the top ranking test and One Day International nations (according to rankings as at April 2005) and an internationally selected Rest of the World XI. Australia was the top ranked nation in both forms of the game as at April 2005.Australia had an opportunity to begin the rebuilding process following the Ashes series loss at the Super Test held against a Rest of the World team in Sydney in October. Although the match was of poor quality with the World team underperforming, it was a good opportunity for some of the Australian team to get back on track. Many did, especially Hayden who scored 111 and 87 and Gilchrist who scored 94 in the first innings and made seven dismissals. Stuart MacGill (who had not played in the 2005 Ashes) took nine wickets. Overall, the Australian Cricket Team clean swept the World XI Team 30 in the One Day International Series, and also won the six-day Test Match.[edit] West IndiesIn November Australia continued to perform well winning a three match Test series with the West Indies comfortably. Stars were Hayden (who was clearly intent on proving that rumors of his cricketing death were premature  he scored 445 runs at an average of 89) and Hussey who had an auspicious debut season. Gilchrist, however, was out of touch with the bat as he had been in England throughout the month.[edit] South Africa TourMain article: Australian cricket team in South Africa in 200506See also: Australia in South Africa, 5th ODI, 2006In the 2006 cricket tour to South Africa, Australia lost the one-day series 32 after a record-breaking final ODI. Setting South Africa a world record target of 434 off 50 overs (the previous record being 398/5 scored by Sri Lanka vs Kenya 10 years previously), South Africa managed to beat Australia by 1 wicket with a new record score of 438. Earlier, Ricky Ponting top-scored with 164 off 105 balls. South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs, likewise batting at number 3, went on to score 175 off 111 balls thereby playing an instrumental role in the run chase. Many other records were broken in the same match. A total of 872 runs were scored (The previous record was 693 when India beat Pakistan by five runs in Karachi in March 2004). Mick Lewis had the ignominy of becoming the most expensive bowler in ODI history with figures of 0/113 in his 10 overs.In the test series that followed however, Australia won convincingly with Brett Lee and Stuart Clark (Man of the Series) playing particularly well.[citation needed][edit] Bangladesh TourFollowing the South African series, Australia toured Bangladesh for a two-test series. Despite expectations of a one-sided contest, the first test proved a very close affair with Bangladesh (historically the weakest test-playing nation) scoring more than 400 first-innings runs and bowling Australia out for 269 in the first innings on a very good batting wicket and ultimately setting Australia a challenging 307 for victory. Ponting's men were able to win this match by three wickets. However, in the second match Australia dominated throughout, winning by an innings and 80 runs. In Australia's only innings, Jason Gillespie became the first nightwatchman to score a double century with 201 not out.[edit] 200607 AshesMain article: 200607 Ashes seriesWarne (right) bowling to Ian Bell at Brisbane Cricket Ground in 2006After winning the ICC Champions Trophy convincingly, Australia went home for their summer to play England in a five-test series.The first test took place in Brisbane at the Gabba. The second test took place in Adelaide from 1 December. The third match of the series was held at the WACA Ground in the West Australian city of Perth. Following the Third test victory, Australia reclaimed the Ashes, already having achieved a winning margin of 30 in the best of five series. England lamented the shortest period of Ashes retention in the history of the tournament, dating back to 1882. In the days following the historic win in Perth, spin bowler Shane Warne announced that he will retire from international cricket at the conclusion of the fifth and final Sydney test in January 2007. This also prompted Justin Langer, Australian opening batsmen at the time, to announce his retirement from Test cricket after the 5th test as well. Fast bowler Glenn McGrath later announced he too would retire from international cricket after the 2007 Cricket World Cup.The fourth match of the series was played at the MCG. Australia took victory in just three days, only needing one innings of batting to outscore England. The fifth match in Sydney ended with Australia capturing a 10 wicket victory. The Australians completed a 50 whitewash of the Ashes series, the first time either side had achieved such a feat since the 192021 series.[edit] 200607 ODI seasonFollowing the Ashes victory over England, Australia began the 2007 Commonwealth Bank Tri-series against England and New Zealand with a series of largely comfortable victories, leading to their coach John Buchanan complaining that the lack of opposition was undermining Australia's World Cup bid.[8] However, injuries to key players contributed to Australia losing two matches in the qualification games and the final 20 to an also injury hit England. With Ponting rested for the series against New Zealand, Australia under Michael Hussey lost the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy 30, their first One Day series loss in New Zealand for 33 years. The loss also cost them the overall number one ranking for the first time since the rankings began.[9][edit] 2007 World CupAustralia dominated the 2007 Cricket World Cup, remaining unbeaten through the tournament. They dominated with the bat and ball. Remarkably they lost just 42 wickets in 11 matches, while claiming 104 out of 110 of their opponents. The best batsman for the tournament was Matthew Hayden, getting three centuries and 659 runs at an average of 73. Australia's keeper Adam Gilchrist starred in the World cup Final, scoring 149 in a convincing and controversial Australian win. Bowler Glenn McGrath was named Man of the Series for his magnificent contribution with the ball.[10][edit] Recent SeasonsMain article: Australian cricket team in 200708Main article: Australian cricket team in 2008Main article: Australian cricket team in 200809Main article: Australian cricket team in 200910[edit] Team coloursFor Test matches, the team wears cricket whites, with an optional sweater or sweater-vest with a green and gold V-neck for use in cold weather. The sponsor's (currently Vodafone) logo is displayed on the right side of the chest while the Cricket Australia coat-of-arms is displayed on the left. If the sweater is being worn the coat-of-arms is displayed under the V-neck and the sponsor's logo is again displayed on the right side of the chest. [11] The baggy green, the Australian cricket cap, is considered an essential part of the cricketing uniform and as a symbol of the national team, with new players being presented with one upon their selection in the team. The helmet also prominently displays the Australian cricketing coat-of-arms. Adidas currently manufactures the whites, with the Adidas logo being displayed on the shirt and pants. Players may choose any manufacturer for their other gear (bat, pads, shoes, gloves, etc).In One Day International cricket and Twenty20 International cricket, the team wears uniforms usually coloured green and gold, Australia's national colours. There have been a variety of different styles and layouts used in both forms of the limited-overs game, with coloured clothing (sometimes known as "pyjamas") being introduced for World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. The sponsors' logos (the Commonwealth Bank for ODIs and KFC for Twenty20s) are prominently displayed on the shirts and other gears.[edit] International groundsMain article: List of cricket grounds in AustraliaEighteen different grounds in Australia have been used for international cricket (Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals. Five were only used once, during the 1992 World Cup, while three (all in Tasmania) only hosted games during 1980s World Series Cups. The main six used are:The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in Melbourne, Victoria (first used for Test cricket in 1877).The Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) in Sydney, New South Wales (first used in 1882).Adelaide Oval in Adelaide, South Australia (first used in 1884).Brisbane Cricket Ground (commonly known as 'The Gabba') in Brisbane, Queensland (first used in 1931).The WACA Ground (commonly known as 'The WACA') in Perth, Western Australia (first used in 1970).Bellerive Oval in Hobart, Tasmania (first used in 1989).Other grounds which have been used for Test cricket are:The Brisbane Exhibition Ground in Brisbane, Queensland (hosted two Tests between 1928 and 1930; no longer used for cricket).Marrara Oval in Darwin, the Northern Territory (hosted two Tests against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in 2003 and 2004).Cazaly's Stadium in Cairns, Queensland(hosted two Tests against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in 2003 and 2004).Grounds which have been used for One Day Internationals only are:The TCA Ground in Hobart, Tasmania (used for one ODI in the 1985 World Series Cup).The NTCA Ground in Launceston, Tasmania (used for one ODI in the 1986 World Series Cup).Devonport Oval in Devonport, Tasmania (used for one ODI in the 1987 World Series Cup).Harrup Park in Mackay, Queensland (hosted one ODI during the 1992 World Cup that was abandoned after two balls[12]).Eastern Oval in Ballarat, Victoria (hosted one ODI during the 1992 World Cup).Manuka Oval in Canberra, ACT (hosted one ODI during the 1992 World Cup and another in the 2008 Commonwealth Bank Series).Berri Oval in Berri, South Australia (hosted one ODI during the 1992 World Cup).Lavington Sports Ground in Albury, New South Wales (hosted one ODI during the 1992 World Cup).Docklands Stadium in Melbourne, Victoria (hosted several ODIs, including all of Melbourne's games in 2006 when the MCG was unavailable due to the 2006 Commonwealth Games - the only indoor stadium used for cricket in Australia).[edit] PersonnelThis is a list of every player to have played for Australia in the last year, and the forms of the game in which they have played.
