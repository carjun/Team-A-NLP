Sarah Palin put a hit out on someone...in front of the whole country and today an assassin killed 6 innocent people trying to follow through with her commands.This isn't conspiracy or coincidence. This actually happened today right underneath all of our noses!! This kind of thing by a major politician has never been so brazenly done in the history of American politics. Whether you believe it or not, Sarah Palin was one of the main contenders to run for President in 2012, and asked for someone to be killed and someone tried to follow through on this for her.This is more than a typical political disagreement or political violence or previous assassination attempts by some rogue citizens. This is one of the most powerful politicians in the country publicly stating that she wants certain people killed and then people trying to kill them. I can't believe even some people here at DU are withholding judgement here on Palin. The facts are right in front of your face. She put crosshairs on someone who got a bullet in her head today.Refresh|+333 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadPalin is a terrorist and should be arrestedRosa LuxemburgJan-08-11 09:02 PM#1+1proud2BlibKansanJan-08-11 09:03 PM#3Hey, Sarah...pokerfanJan-08-11 09:18 PM#23Taking them back one by one?Rosa LuxemburgJan-08-11 10:14 PM#47LOL!            ntEnthusiastJan-09-11 11:15 AM#96and you know who is actually happy about it tonight?

Sarah here and her ilk have.However I would like to put this counter spin on this for a moment.  Can we wait a bit before we fuck something up.  First mention of a Sarah Palin connection and someone called whoever said it first on cnn's comments a retard.  So let it be known a Sarah Palin supporter called a possible anti Sarah Palin supporter a retard first.  Course no boths sids have said retard probably should watch a few episodes of CSI.  namely the one in which a down syndrome person (which I don't know the current term is) is called a retard and killed for it.  and at the end.  to retard or retarded is to hold back.and Grissom says to the a hole..  his life is about to be retarded.  Clearly I'm not shocked this happened, yes I am shocked it didn't happen in 2008, 2009 or 2010.  Still shocked someone hadn't tried this on Obama.  ( say tried because it's really not possible.  although not impossible)    Frankly the way security was around the Republican Conventions in St Paul in 2008 was sick.  Where were they here?  Dems don't rely on thugs to control their security.  Or Minority Report style security.  I'm depressed, and I've got a moronic dad who keeps encouraging me to kill myself.  Except I'm also a Christian and suicide is bad.  My faith is better off than my dad who's a tea party member.  Albiet it comes with a down side.  I'm depressed and my only vent is politics.  Keeps me sane.  Usually his retort is that hey go ahead.  and they won't charge him for mental abuse because I have no rights.  I really have no idea.  Someone puts a person down every day (lately he has not been acting like himself though) is that legal?  Wouldn't have the balls to try.    He's a big Vander Plats fan in Iowa.  Who wants to circumvent our supreme court in Iowa.  Already did it to 3 of them.  I'm tempered by this fact.  Knee jerks are not good and I hope we on the left can stop a few knee jerks.  Dad does them often, I do them sometimes too simply because I'm in a corner.     Like Sean Hannity trying to make a person do a knee jerk.  They provoke a person just to prove they are right.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmolly77      (796 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:07 PMResponse to Reply #143146.PatrynXXI am sorry that you are depressed.

I've been warning about Palin for a long time.I also disagree with those who are clucking away that she will be easy to beat so leave her alone. As far as I'm concerned she's dangerous. Also dangerous politically, she's got the whole right wing behind her, her party's base, which makes her nomination easier, which makes it easier for her to sail into the general election unbruised.  She's polished herself enough and found judgment-free venues for her political filth that she's in much better shape for 2012 than when she was the VP nominee and she is DANGEROUS.Palin has to be stopped NOW, politically.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topzonkers      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 09:02 PMResponse to Original message2.Assassination Politics.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmalaise      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 09:03 PMResponse to Original message4.Palin is historyThis semi-literate accessory to murder is done - at last.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDuer 157099      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 09:07 PMResponse to Reply #412.I wish I could be as optimistic as you areSadly, I don't think this will have any real impact on her or her aspirations.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopUzybone      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 11:27 PMResponse to Reply #468.agreedPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOld and In the Way      (1000+ posts)Sat Jan-08-11 09:04 PMResponse to Original message5.Sorry...hit the unrec instead of the rec.Yeah, inciting violence used to be a crime.

Douglas who was firedEdited on Sun Jan-09-11 11:22 AM by 1monsterby Geico under pressure from Andrew Bitebart fans after D.C. Douglass, as private citizen Lance Baxter, left a voice mail on Dick Army's Freedomworks:"I called as a private citizen to make a complaint," explains Mr. Douglas. "Racism and homophobia are my Achilles heel, but unfortunately my message included inappropriate words and I am sorry for that. However, telling their members to harass my employer to get me fired is an egregiously disproportionate response to my actions." Mr. Douglas believes his connection to GEICO, a company already on FreedomWorks' boycott list for pulling their ads from Glenn Beck's show, is the main reason he was targeted so forcefully. "Even though I left the message during the week of March 23, the harassing calls didn't hit until April 14, the morning after I posted about my GEICO campaign on my Facebook page."It's not clear if Douglas is gay, although in all press accounts of the firing, he mentions being enraged by the homophobia of the Tea Party movement. His message to FreedomWorks asked "how many retarded people" work there and whether the group would take responsibility when one of their members killed somebody. Douglas says he doesn't blame GEICO for his firing, but he's open to suing FreedomWorks. http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2010/04/geico-announcer-fi... I guess that it is a no brainer that Sarah won't own up to any responsibility for her unacceptable imagery.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopRandomThoughts      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 09:08 PMResponse to Original message13.Or someone did it to get you to post that exact thing.Using violence and hurt to try to change something.

Michael Savage discussed multiculturalism and predicted, "This is not going to go on in this country much longer. We're going to have a revolution in this country if this keeps up. These people are pushing the wrong people around." Savage further said that "the rage has reached a boil. If they keep pushing us around, and if we keep having these schmucks running for office catering to the multicultural people who are destroying the culture of this country ... guaranteed the people -- the white male in particular." He continued:    Let me talk specifically. The white male in particular -- the one without connections, the one without money -- has nothing to lose, and you haven't seen him yet. You haven't seen him explode in this country, and he's still a majority, by the way. In case you don't know it. He is still the majority. No one speaks for him. Everyone craps on him. People use him for cannon fodder. And he has no voice whatsoever. He has nobody speaking for him.    So he goes to these extreme fighting events. Take a look at them, and you'll see what the white male is capable of. And you're going to find out that if you keep pushing this country around, you'll find out that there's an ugly side to the white male that has been suppressed for probably 30 years right now, but it really has never gone away.More quotes here:http://mediamatters.org/iphone/research/200909300003 http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/report_white_powder_inc...

However, they have invited vile people into their tent and accepted race and hatred in every form, and they know that among those people are some who are unbalanced enough to take their rhetoric seriously enough to act on it.  And yet, they keep parroting the hateful rhetoric anyway.  They are to blame for the actions their hate inspires.http://www.politicsplus.org/blog/?p=2324     * As noted by The Fold Blog last week, a right wing extremist, Byron Williams, opened fire on police in Oakland, CA during a traffic stop.  The gunman was later found to have been a fan of Fox News and Glenn Beck.  He told police his intention was to start a revolution by targeting organizations and people he had heard about on Fox News.  His mother stated Williams "watched the news on television and was upset by 'the way Congress was railroading through all these left-wing agenda items.'"Pittsburgh police say a man wearing a bulletproof vest opened fire on officers during a domestic disturbance call, killing three of them. Police chief Nate Harper says the motive for Saturdays shooting isnt clear.http://www.oliverwillis.com/2009/04/04/right-wing-paran... /http://www.thefoldblog.com/2010/07/extremist-gop-rhetor...

When Obama was elected they bought so much ammo that all the gun shops ran out, they manufactured more and the gun shops ran out again.
