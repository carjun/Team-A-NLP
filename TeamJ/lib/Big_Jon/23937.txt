   ThinkProgress           Lax Gun Control Laws Allowed Mentally Ill Shooter To Buy Previously-Banned Magazine Clip    ThinkProgressWonk RoomYglesiasProgress ReportThink ProgressLax Gun Control Laws Allowed Mentally Ill Shooter To Buy Previously-Banned Magazine Clip            By Tanya Somanader  on Jan 10th, 2011 at 12:04 pm          Lax Gun Control Laws Allowed Mentally Ill Shooter To Buy Previously-Banned Magazine Clip The profile of 22-year-old assassin Jared Lee Loughner has triggered a debate over gun control, societys treatment of the mentally ill, and the dangerous intersection of the two. The shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, was a known recluse and a rejected Army recruit with a history of troubling behavior that he documented in rambling postings on his MySpace page, YouTube videos and classes he attended at Pima Community College in Tucson.Railing against new currency, government brainwash methods, and his own mind-control abilities, Loughners mental health prompted college officials to suspend him and tell his parents that he would have to get a mental health evaluation if he wanted to return to school. However, despite evidence of his precarious mental state, Loughner walked into the Sportsmans Warehouse in Tucson, passed a background check, and legally purchased a gun on Nov. 30, 2010.Current federal laws prohibit selling weapons to the mentally ill but, as forensic psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz notes, current gun control laws allow no way to determine [someone] is a mentally ill person. The only thing the existing law does about that is quite absurd, Dietz said, referring to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms form which only asks the applicant whether they had been adjudicated dangerously mentally ill. Whats more, there is no waiting period in Arizona unless someone is flagged by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). A measure even more unlikely to work in Arizona as the state is woefully behind in entering the 121,700 records of disqualifying mental illness into NICS, having entered only 4, 465 between 2008 and 2010. But even with Loughner slipping through the system, the magazine clip he purchased with his gun wouldnt have existed had gun laws been up to date. The now-expired assault weapons ban that existed from 1994 to 2004 prohibited gun manufacturers from marketing handguns with the high-capacity magazines Loughner used. Under the assault weapons ban, it was illegal to make or sell clips holding more than 10 rounds. The magazine used by Loughner held 31 rounds. The Brady Campaign said that, had he used a traditional magazine, it would have drastically reduced the number of shots he got off before reloading. While President Bush backed renewing the ban, it never passed Congress in 2004. The failure to address these gaps in gun control was not lost on conservative Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, who said the following on C-Span this morning: KRISTOL: I think it really would be terrible if our political discourse gets further poisoned by the kind of debate about this assassination attempt and these murders. Cant we just agree that these murders are terrible?  We can have a reasonable debate about  what could be done about security. We can have a reasonable debate about policy issues, like gun-control. I think thats a perfectly reasonable thing to address. I wouldnt do it the day after. Its better to reflect a little bit about  sensible legislation, but its not ridiculous for someone to say lets look at why this guy could got so many shots off so quickly. Maybe we should go back to at the assault weapons ban  Im ambivalent about that, I think there are policy arguments on both sides  but thats a kind of reasonable response. Watch it (begins at 1:05):While Kristol may recognize gun control as an important discussion, some conservative lawmakers remain adamantly opposed to such a reasonable response. Ignoring the failure of these laws, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) argues we have state and federal laws on the books that already prohibit persons who have been deemed mentally insane so I dont think were going to legislate our way out of the risk. Believing Arizonas weak gun laws were unrelated to the shooting, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) stated more bluntly, the weapons dont kill people; its the individual that kills these people.New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is leading a nationwide campaign against gun violence, said, the Tucson shootings are just terrible examples, and a terrible reminder, of the gun violence that happens every single day in our country.  And so it will continue until we get serious about cracking down on illegal guns and protecting innocent people.Update The New York Times notes today that the number of Americans supporting stricter gun laws has been gradually declining over the last 20 years, decreasing from 78 percent in 1990 to 44 percent in 2010. While the 1999 Columbine and 2007 Virginia Tech shootings have had little effect on these views, 54 percent of Americans mark "substantially more support" for a nationwide assault weapons ban.Update Longtime gun control advocate Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) said today he will "introduce legislation banning high-capacity ammunition clips like the one linked to a weekend shooting." "The only reason to have 33 bullets loaded in a handgun is to kill a lot of people very quickly. These high-capacity clips simply should not be on the market," he said. Lautenberg will introduce the bill when the Senate returns to session later this month.TweetPrintRelated Posts:NRA Members Disagree With NRA Leadership: Those On Terrorist Watch List Should Not Be Able To Buy FirearmsNRA Members Dont Think Gun Owners Should Bring Weapons Into Bars And Drink AlcoholPoll Shows NRA Members Are More Moderate Than Their Leaders, Support Some Restrictions On FirearmsGun Industry Profits Off NRAs Fearmongering About Obama Gun PoliciesIs The Obama Administration Walking Back Its Commitment To Reinstating The Assault Weapons Ban?Anonymoustheres an achievement the nra can be proud of.katyi remember commenting here at TP when that law was allowed to expirewe all knew what would happenmaybe the surprise is that it took this longBadmoodman   Jared Loughners extensive legal fees will be covered by the NRA, one way or another.

There is no reason to abolish waiting periods and to ban guns from certain places. Here in PA, you cant take a gun into Stadiums and other public places.

I know its unreasonable  it only takes one bullet to kill somebody if you are skilled, and having multiple small clips can still do the job of one big one  but this desperate spray and pray killing may benefit from high-capacity magazines.If the Assault Weapons Ban gets reinstated, its going to mean that lots of people will try and snap up whatever they can.  Not only that, but the gun manufacturers and gun lobby will crank up their efforts to repeal the legislation; and with Citizens United (or Untied) still in place, that means millions of dollars can taint the next election.AnonymousThis explains the question I had  I couldnt understand how a person with a pistol shot so many people.  Even if they were a super shot and a bullet went through 2 people, you wouldnt have the number of shot and killed people.Oversized clips on a pistol!

Gabrielle GiffordsAnonymousIt seems to me that I have heard several right-wingers say we dont need new immigration laws; we need to enforce the existing laws.Too bad that Arizonas politicians didnt take their own advice when it comes to gun laws.  And you can bet that this weekends tragedy wont motivate them to do so now.  I have a friend who lives in the Tucson area in the winter who told me yesterday that the likely reaction in Arizona will be to REQUIRE that all citizens carry concealed handguns.  That sounds very probable to me . . . its the usual burn-the-toast-and-scrape-it right wing response.We have all seen this movie before and we know how it ends.  Sadly, we will see it again in the future.Badmoodman   We need to develop and apply a competency test that will prevent whackjobs from obtaining rapid-fire weapons. That university banned Loughner from their campus because he was unstable. Had they told any government agency that Loughner was dangerous, and, if that agency had quickly disseminated the information, then maybe he would not have easily gotten a semi-automatic weapon and a big box of bullets to go with it. (Guns dont kill people; bullets kill people.)I dont know Arizona law, but I doubt that the school was required to report that they had a dangerous student, and, citing privacy concerns, the school can escape responsibility for their inaction. And, because government moves at the speed of a crippled turtle, rapid dissemination isnt going to happen.Austininc4You do know  that is  total  BullSh!t,  right?

So why allow PEOPLE to have guns in their hands?  Do you believe more innocent lives are saved because the good guys have guns than are lost because the bad guys have guns?  There is no comparison.  Many, many, many more innocents are shot and or killed because the other guy has a gun; not because they dont!AnonymousIts too bad that TP couldnt have come up with a picture truly representative of the weapon that Loughner actually used.

Here are some excerpts from a speech given by Robert F Kennedy in Cleveland Ohio on April 5, 1968, the day after Martin Luther King, Jr. was murdered in Memphis.  Ironically, two months later  to the day, June 5, 1968  Robert Kennedy was also murdered.The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same.  If only his words had been heard and applied.This . . . is not a day for politics. I have saved this one opportunity, my only event of today, to speak briefly to you about the mindless menace of violence in America which again stains our land and every one of our lives.It is not the concern of any one race. The victims of the violence are black and white, rich and poor, young and old, famous and unknown. They are, most important of all, human beings whom other human beings loved and needed. No oneno matter where he lives or what he doescan be certain who next will suffer from some senseless act of bloodshed. And yet it goes on and on and on in this country of ours.Why? What has violence ever accomplished? What has it ever created? No martyrs cause has ever been stilled by an assassins bullet.No wrongs have ever been righted by riots and civil disorders. A sniper is only a coward, not a hero; and an uncontrolled, uncontrollable mob is only the voice of madness, not the voice of reason.. . . whenever we tear at the fabric of the life which another man has painfully and clumsily woven for himself and his children, whenever we do this, then the whole nation is degraded. . . . Yet we seemingly tolerate a rising level of violence that ignores our common humanity and our claims to civilization alike. We calmly accept newspaper reports of civilian slaughter in far-off lands. We glorify killing on movie and television screens and call it entertainment. We make it easy for men of all shades of sanity to acquire whatever weapons and ammunition they desire.Too often we honor swagger and bluster and wielders of force; too often we excuse those who are willing to build their own lives on the shattered dreams of other human beings.. . . this much is clear: violence breeds violence, repression brings retaliation, and only a cleansing of our whole society can remove this sickness from our soul.For there is another kind of violence, slower but just as deadly destructive as the shot or the bomb in the night. This is the violence of institutions; indifference and inaction and slow decay. This is the violence that afflicts the poor, that poisons relations between men because their skin has different colors. This is the slow destruction of a child by hunger, and schools without books and homes without heat in the winter.This is the breaking of a mans spirit by denying him the chance to stand as a father and as a man among other men. And this too afflicts us all.. . . When you teach a man to hate and fear his brother, when you teach that he is a lesser man because of his color or his beliefs or the policies that he pursues, when you teach that those who differ from you threaten your freedom or your job or your home, or your family, then you also learn to confront others not as fellow citizens but as enemies, to be met not with cooperation but with conquest; to be subjugated and to be mastered.We learn, at the last, to look at our brothers as aliens, alien men with whom we share a city, but not a community; men bound to us in common dwelling, but not in a common effort. We learn to share only a common fear, only a common desire to retreat from each other, only a common impulse to meet disagreement with force. For all this, there are no final answers.Yet we know what we must do. It is to achieve true justice among our fellow citizens. The question is not what programs we should seek to enact. The question is whether we can find in our own midst and in our own hearts that leadership of humane purpose that will recognize the terrible truths of our existence.We must admit the vanity of our false distinctions among men and learn to find our own advancement in the search for the advancement of others. We must admit in ourselves that our own childrens future cannot be built on the misfortunes of others. We must recognize that this short life can neither be ennobled or enriched by hatred or revenge.Our lives on this planet are too short and the work to be done too great to let this spirit flourish any longer in this land of ours. Of course we cannot vanquish it with a program, nor with a resolution.But we can perhaps remember, if only for a time, that those who live with us are our brothers, that they share with us the same short moment of life; that they seek, as do we, nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and in happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment that they can.Surely, this bond of common faith, surely this bond of common goal, can begin to teach us something. Surely, we can learn, at least, to look at those around us as fellow men, and surely we can begin to work a little harder to bind up the wounds among us and to become in our own hearts brothers and countrymen once again.BelacNor does dissent require 30 round clips.AnonymousNah  he could have done the same thing with a sling shot. /snarkhttp://www.youtube.com/BizarrobrainBizarrobrainYup.

I had to walk through Watts to get back home, as I didnt have money for a cab. Watts was a firestorm that day, with many people on street corners very angry with MKLs death.As a white guy, I dont know how I ever made it out of there alive. Adults would send kids out on the street to taunt me as I walked by. The adults would shout & question WTF I was doing in their neighborhoods. Finally, 3 large men came out & stood in front of me, asking me the questions directly.I explained what I was doing there and that I didnt have money for a ride.They believed me. I thought to myself, Im not going to die in Viet Nam. Im going to die in Watts.My point? Im sure some of these folks had guns. NOBODY fired a shot. Thats the difference.

We could probably do this all day.But Id like to throw something else into the soup.  And that is the point made in Michael Moores documentary, Bowling for Columbine.In it, Moore points out that the number of guns per capita is about the same in the United States as it is in Canada.  Yet Canada experiences far fewer shootings (of humans) than we do here in the USA.Why is that?Our culture differs from Canadas significantly when it comes to fear.  We are told to be afraid.

We are told that we must do everything possible to protect ourselves, because were in danger.We get this from politicians who look to be re-elected.  We get this from pundits using sensationalism for ratings.  We get this from home alarm salespeople trying to make money.As a result, we have one of the most paranoid, fearful, OCD-ridden societies in the world.  We put multiple locks on our doors.  We dont permit our children outside unsupervised, and we certainly dont allow them to walk to school by themselves.  And we feel the need to own guns to protect ourselves from all the boogeymen out there.Why have we allowed ourselves to become this?  Because people make money and gain power through the fear industry.Unfortunately, a byproduct of this culture is that we wind up with a lot of people who become unhinged.

Thats my point!AnonymousPart of the problem with this whole crazy person got a gun tack is that if youre talking about taking a right away from someone, some form of due process should be involved.  A college suspending someone because of disruptive behavior doesnt count as formal/legal due process.  Only involuntary commitment would.  Im not sure how you could write a law that would have prevented this guy from getting a gun due to his mental state without seriously fudging the line in terms of general revocation of citizens rights across the board.  If anybody says youre crazy then you never get to buy a gun even if youve never seen the inside of a court or mental health facility?  If so, what other rights might such a rule be used as precedent to revoke?Not supporting any wingnut side here, just wondering how this argument could play out in practical legal terms.Maybe we should fund mental health services more and the college could have triggered a proactive visit to this guy from a mental health professional, but even that wouldnt guarantee that he couldnt have slipped through a crack.  And it involves a certain amount of invasiveness in and of itself.AnonymousLord, you dont know anything, do you?  I dont want it added, its already there.

Unlike every other Constitutional amendment, the 2nd states its own reasoning in its text: to maintain a well-regulated militia.  I cant imagine how you missed that part.  It comes right before the part that you were able to comprehend.The founding fathers even passed a law requiring all adult males to buy a gun (hello, individual mandate!) so theyd be able to bring it if they were ever called up to muster.  They were well on record as explaining why the 2nd amendment is there: because they couldnt afford to supply a standing army.Furthermore, the strong military response to Shays revolt and the Whiskey rebellion demonstrates quite clearly what the founding fathers thought of people who take up arms against the United States government.AnonymousThe magazine used by Loughner held 31 rounds. One of the women that got shot grabbed a second clip away from him and he was loading a third that jammed before two other people grabbed him and sat on him.

Thank God it wasnt.AnonymousSince the earlier post got hijacked:The mechanism for preventing mentally ill people from buying a gun is already in place.

Also, another problem with the crazy person with a gun meme is what I just saw on Faux (I dont watch it, but a local docs waiting room was set to it).  As opposed to their previous stance, they are now rather self-serving-ly changed to a new stance of how awful it is that the lib-rals instantly jumped to blaming the tea party.  How awful it is to jump to conclusions before you have the full story.  More and more it looks like a crazy person with a gun, etc.  Only problem is they are using this to totally divorce themselves from any responsisibility for the effects of hate speech.  That a crazy person with a gun may be influenced by the hate speech, etc.    Or see more recent TP article of Frum blaming marijuana.AnonymousA person who applies to a labor employment agency has to take a psychological test to see if they are mentally stable enough to be sent to a job site to dig a ditch for minimum wage.  Yet a person can buy a gun in this country simply by putting down the money in many areas.  Does this even make sense?http://tpzoo.wordpress.com/ZooeyCurrent federal laws prohibit selling weapons to the mentally ill but, as forensic psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz notes, current gun control laws allow no way to determine [someone] is a mentally ill person. I asked you for your suggestions about how to define mentally ill.  Clearly you cannot do so  and neither can mental health professionals, like Dr Dietz.  Are you seeing the problem of unintended consequences in some laws?Whats your major malfunction?AnonymousIts sad and telling that we have so many here mocking and laughing at the suggestion that gun laws have gotten more lax while at the same time that gun deaths have continued unabated and that a semi-automatic gun was used in the deaths Saturday in Tucson.  What most of those posting here fail to understand is that there is something in our culture, not just the ready availability of guns, as Michael Moore tried to discern and articulate in his 2002 movie Bowling for Columbine that encourages and enhances both gun ownership and gun violence.In fact, the ready availability of guns and the continuing slide toward the wild west mentality of the last half of the 1800s as depicted in that stable of Hollywood since the movie moguls from the east coast first moved movie making to Hollywood, is a symptom rather than a cause.    Indeed, we are one of the most violent industrialized nations in the world; we regularly have by far the highest levels of violence and statistics for shooting deaths every year and have for years.  Most countries have deaths in the low hundreds for the yearwe generally have deaths in the tens of thousands.  And the statistic is not a reflection of our population but is a direct result of our gun culture.And it has been this way for at least a century.  I once read some newspapers from Chicago in the 1920s and one newspaper, I think it was the Tribune had a clock and a daily count of how many people had been killed to date for that year.  And it was in the hundreds by the end of the year in each of years that I looked at.  In fact for the decade of the twenties Chicago had more than one gun death a day on average. So this reliance on violence and guns to solve our problems both private and public isnt a recent phenomenon, what is troubling is that even though we have been long aware of the problem of violent deaths by shooting we have done nothing substantive in all that time to change or that has changed the culture.And with every one of these tragedies we go through this little exercise and the people who would sincerely like to see something done about this are pooh-poohed by those who like to believe that guns dont cause violent deaths only people do.  Yet we make no apparent progress in fining out why we are the most violent country in the industrialized world.   And when people make statements like Mr. Helmke, who said, If more guns made us safer, wed be the safest country in the world.  What he is reflecting here is the idea that we can somehow shoot our way to safety.  If we all had guns then we wouldnt shoot each other.  Yet we all know that there are people everyday who are shooting people in states like Texas and Arizona with these lax gun laws.  But why have gun laws become so lax.  Why have we, after all these years of gun deaths, still not seriously looked at why we are such a violent society and culture.The way we have fetishized gun ownership is at least as astounding as the way we have fetishized tax cuts and the sense of rugged individualism and the frontier mentality.  I mention theses all together because I think they are all related to this violence.  The fact that we took this nation from the natives, stole it really at the point of a gun might have something to do with our dependence on guns as the weapon of last resort when we cant get what we want.  The idea that we can always take what we want at the point of a gun if all else fails is another idea that seems to be purely American in origin.  The fact that our Constitution enshrines gun ownership right after freedom to assemble, speak out, and worship whatever go we want or not, is indicative of just how deep this fetishization of gun ownership goes.I recently saw part of John Fords famous 1956 western The Searchers which is widely seen as his most important film.  In the scene that I saw, John Wayne is angry at the Indians and he takes two rifles and begins wildly killing the buffaloes while ranting against the Indians and says that his killing of these animals which he does for a couple of minutes in this film is designed to keep them out of the hands of the Indians because he knows that the natives are dependent on the buffalo for so much of their culture.  Even though this is the only time I have seen this seen and I watch numerous movies, I have had a hard time getting it out of my mind.  First, for its maniacal brutality but second for its intent and its importance in this highly and widely celebrate film.  I think that there is something at the heart of this film and its depiction that is indeed central to our culture and it is this idea and this sensibility that is at the core of our problem.On my bookshelf, and I am bookish and so rather than guns I own books I have two that I am set to read by Richard Slotkin, who has studied this cultural heritage for over 30 years, that may go a long way to understanding this aspect of our collective American consciousness, one is called The Fatal Environment: The Myth of the Frontier In the Age of Industrialization 1800-1890 (1985) the other is called Gunfiighter Nation: The Myth of the Frontier in Twentieth Century America (1998).  As I said our obsession with and fetishization of guns is and always has been a troubling and dangerous aspect of our society, not a cause but a symptom of a far greater problem.  And even though I think that gun laws need to be strengthened I am not sanguine about the impact of that on the rest of our society. But I dont think that letting or encouraging everyone to own a gun is the answer either, it seems if the myths are any clue that we tried that in the 1800s and it didnt work out too well.AnonymousSomalia doesnt have gun control eitherthe rest of the CIVILIZED world thinks we are insane.which at least 50% of us absolutely are.AnonymousYa lax gun laws. Thats a laff.Last time I was in America some guy tried to sell me a pistol he had under his towel at the beach.As far as I see it you dont have any gun laws. If somebody wants a gun in America (or Canada, Mexico, the Carribean, western Europe) they get a gun in America.AnonymousId be interested in seeing an exact count of how many people would have been harmed or killed if Loughner had been restricted to regular sized clips.  I imagine itll take a while for the police to fully work out the gunshot sequence.AnonymousSounds like a reasonable approach and comparison.  I think the overall amount of regulation involved for firearms use should be equivalent to that involved in owning and operating a motor vehicle.  Which is to say quite a bit, but those who use them responsibly shouldnt have anything to complain about.Frankly, regulation would be good for the NRA since theyre presently the main group teaching firearm safety classes; making such classes mandatory would help to fill their coffers.AnonymousGiven that at any moment someone could concivibly take a machine gun out of thier trunk and open fire into a crowd with a weapon they bought legally with no background check and less then 500$ from a store just across townYa, you have us pegged. We do kinda think you lot are insane.AnonymousAs someone who is an outspoken critic of the GOP I would encourage the Democrats to abandon the gun control rhetoric. You will not win. It is a lose/lose issue that will completely alienate moderates and could lead to a disastrous outcome like Gore losing his own state in the 2000 election. Take my word for it, continue and you will regret it.AnonymousSounds like a good place to start.  Low-hanging fruit and all that.AnonymousSo the way for progressives to gain victories is to capitulate to the extremist right?  Yeah, we arent going to fall for that.AnonymousTwo points:  All firearms purchases from a store require a background check, and machine guns cost a minimum of $10,000, not $500.AnonymousBut remember the old saw, repeated again recently by a troll, Guns dont kill people, People kill people.  With that logic Loughner couldve had an ammo belt and a machine gun and still the gun would have remained blameless.Sorry, I know that sounds trite and bitter, and maybe it is.  But my anger at the continuing STUPIDITY that surrounds gun ownership sometimes demands that I point out the obvious.  Again, and again, and again.How I wish we could do away with the second amendment, or at least interpret it properly.  No way did the founders ever wish this level of crap to descend on the country they so proudly and carefully designed.AnonymousWhy didnt you notify a policeman?  Thats an illegal sale.Anonymousnice to see you back, elbruce.AnonymousFYI:  Jared Lee Loughner had a MySpace page.  MySpace is own by Fox.  Enough said.AnonymousI am not the extremist right but I do own guns. If liberals try to declare a gun control strategy it will backfire on them like it did in the 2000 election. I despise the GOP but I will NOT sanction nor vote for someone who proposes gun control. Bottom line, whether you on the left or the extremists on the right like it or not  most of the country is in the middle. I live in Illinois and you would lose this state, except Chicago, if you enacted gun control legislation. Im just giving you some good advice, hoping the degenerates in the GOP dont ride this into office. You try to enact gun control legislation and youll be cutting off your nose to spite your face. But the fools in the Democratic party will probably get all self-righteous and do their best Jerry Falwell impersonation and trumpet gun control as the Democrats new strategy. Im sure you idiots will self-destruct AGAIN because the dimwits on the left are very, very good at doing that.AnonymousSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) stated more bluntly, the weapons dont kill people; its the individual that kills these people..  This makes me nuts!  If someone kills with their bare hands, that is people killing people.  But, as one who has been robbed at gunpoint, it changes EVERYTHING.  Guns kill people with more efficiency, more rapidity and more devastation than anything else short of a bomb.  Bigger guns with more capacity can kill more people.  ITS THE GUNS THAT KILL, I say to the Diva Paul.  Reasonable controls are not the same as an outright ban.  Get real and be responsible.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PZPpWTRTUBamboo_HarvesterWhy are we still hearing from this nazi ?AnonymousThat background check in Arizona must have been a real doozey.AnonymousSorry sport,  people dont go around shooting people on pot,  otherwise their would be only a handful of people still alive today.

I even spent several years working for a large ammo manufacturer. What I would like to see is for all purchases of firearms and ammo be held to the standard of a conceal/carry law. Another good idea would be for those who supply guns, in violation of the law, to psychopaths to face the same charges as said psychopath.In a sane world, the person who supplied the gun used in this attack would be facing death row.AnonymousThe only problem is the definition of reasonable. Some here have already proposed we go back to black powder muzzle loaders because thats what they had when the second amendment was written. Idiots like that keep any reasonable efforts from being proposed or adopted.Gun owners don not trust gun control advocates. Nor should they. I sure dont.AnonymousThere are many gun owners who are also advocates of sane controls.  Being a gun owner does not infer a political status. Shock of shocks, even liberals own guns.  They are just not rabidly enraptured with them.El BruceAll Im reading here is I play a moderate on the internet, but Im here to say that you progressives should cave on this issue or else youll lose.  I dont know if youve noticed how the Dems have been doing for the past two years, but caving is losing.Anonymouswhy wasnt loughner taken out as soon as the first shot was fired???The rational answer is, because those who know how to operate firearms safely (one of the men who tackled Loughner had a gun on him) know better than to take a shot in a crowded venue. Why? Bullets arent always projectiles that kill a target and stay there sometimes the shooter will miss (as was the case with Loughner himself), and sometimes the bullet will ricochet. Sometimes, even with a 9mm, the bullet will go through the intended target and kill someone behind him.Of course, few righties will mention this very common-sense reason because in all likelihood they dont know how to operate a firearm safely.AnonymousYeah, and theyd be the first to complain about rude drivers in India or Brazil.AnonymousSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) stated more bluntly, the weapons dont kill people; its the individual that kills these people.Well, God bless weapons.Its this kind of convoluted logic that could lead to the banning of people.Seriously, it takes two to tango. If humans are going to kill, they need a weapon, even if its only their hands. Given the right conditions, a pellet gun can kill. The debate is about why we should keep piling on more and more weapons. How much is too much? Are bombs OK? Really, really big bombs? Where do we draw the line?Then comes regulation, traditonally laid-off as liberal value. I wonder.One definition for conservativism is: the tendency to prefer an existing or traditional situation to change. If that be the case, I defy you to find a person more conservativethan a guy with a loaded gun pointed at him.Its an old conundrum, this; guns dont kill people bumper-sticker. Yes, people kill people and the preferred weapon is a gun. Thats what there made for. To those who would argue that a gun is only a tool, Id suggest that you go look up the definition of same. Tools are instruments usually associated with creativity and building,and not simply for destruction. That is the sum total of the use for a gun.If were going to have to live with the serpent, were going to have to have ENFORCED regulations, Such does not seem to be the case in Tucson.AnonymousNo kidding? Then the ones that tried to sell me them were breaking the law, as was the gun show I was at with teh m-16 as was the guy who had a pistol under his beach towel.Dude, I assume youre American, Im not. Im a Canadian. I get offered more guns to buy in after hours club in New York then I do at a legal gun show in Canada.If I were a scum bag I could make all sorts of money moving firearms across the border. All things being equal, Im not a scum bag.I would be happy to testify that I was offered a fully automatic weapon at a gunshow-no questions asked- even though I was a foriegn citizen. For 500$.AnonymousAre you mistaking machine guns for assault rifles?  Im guessing thats the disconnect.  And yes, anyone who tried to sell a firearm, no matter what the type, to a non-national is breaking the law.  The only legal way to sell a firearm without an NCIS check is between citizens of the same state, or the (should be closed) gun show loophole.  Further New York has prohibitions on damned near everything, so pretty much any firearms-related transaction youre getting in the bars you go to is illegal.AnonymousAttorneys cost $480?  Do you have contact information for them?AnonymousIts the same as in every state.  Ive already posted twice about the lack of compliance on Arizonas part regarding reporting the mentally ill, its a good thing not to let mentally ill people own handguns.AnonymousDont tell us.  Tell all those republicans who rant and rave at the very mention of any sort of gun control.  The NRA has lobbied so successfully that there are not even any consumer protections on guns.  If it blows up in your face due to improper manufacture? Tough luck.  Its completely out of balance.EugenDebsYou are a LIAR. You are a DICK. You are a DISEASEhttp://www.yuregininsesi.comyuregininsesiI have never understood how anyone could be against a waiting period for purchasing a gun. If you are so impulsive that you demand to buy one today, then that indicates a serious lack of self control.A person with such impulsivity shouldnt have a gun.sesli chat sesli sohbet chat roulette omegle yuregininsesiblog comments powered by DisqusJump to TopAbout Think Progress | Contact Us | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy (off-site) | RSS | Donate 2005-2011 Center for American Progress Action FundRSSView Most PopularMost TweetedMost EmailedMost CommentedLast 24 HoursThis WeekThis MonthVIDEO: House Republicans Explain Why They Wont Give Up Their Own Government-Sponsored Health CareChamber President Tells Congress To Starve To Death Financially New Consumer Protection BureauRep.
