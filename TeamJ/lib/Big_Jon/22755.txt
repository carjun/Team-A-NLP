More F/A-18EF Super Hornets will be purchased and older F/A-18 Hornets will have their service lives extended for the Marine Corps to make up for the B delay or cut.EFV is gone. Savings will be used to upgrade the AAV with more armor, better electronics and weaponry.Army SLAMRAAM canceled.The Non-Line of Sight Launch System gone.Drawdown by 27K Soldiers and up to 20K Marines from end strength in 2015Whats in  Air Force:More Air Force Reapers.More EELVs.Modernize F-15 radars.New long range nuclear strike bomber  that can be optionally piloted.More.This from the New York Times.Federal officials said Mr. Gates had been seeking to increase the basic Pentagon budget, excluding war costs, to $566 billion for fiscal 2012, but had to push the White House to approve $553 billion, or $13 billion less.That would be a slight increase over the $549 billion that the Pentagon had sought for 2011 and the moderately lower numbers that Congress is considering for this year.Gordon Adams, a Clinton administration budget official who served on Mr. Obamastransition team, said he understood that White House budget officials initially wanted to shave the Pentagons request by at least $20 billion for 2012.Mr. Adams said Mr. Gates viewed this as breaking an earlier promise, and he met withPresident Obama three times before Christmas to get at least $8 billion restored. Mr. Gates was also able to persuade the White House to reduce its demands for cuts over the next five years to $78 billion from $150 billion.But even so, Mr. Adams said, I think the floor under defense spending has now gone soft But given the Congress authorizes government spending a year at a time, he said, the projected numbers beyond 2012 are up for grabs. Dont count on any of it.Once Mr. Obama releases his budget proposals in February, the battle will shift to Capitol Hill, where it is hard to predict how the cross-currents will shake out now that the Republicans control the House..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Military, Politics, The Economy, Updates$553 Billion figure, Congress, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Gates wanted more money, Program cuts, The Defense Budget, The White House, Winners/LosersRead moreSome Dog comments on the Wikileaks this Monday morning 11/29/10.November 29, 2010jamesb101No commentsI was gonna send this comment to Talkandpolitics.But it got long so Im posting itFollow up on this.Before I went out on my walk I saw Mullen on the tube.He made laugh so hard ..I actually forgot my morning aches and pains.Hes all serious you know..Blah, blah, blah.The people who did this are hurting the US.Puttting people in dangerBlah, blahI just cracked up!Is this guy kidding me???Does he get it?Or is he just acting stupid?Assange and his crew are FOR REAL!They are going to publish more stuff that Im sure they have!They have tried to make sure they dont publish TOP SECRET stuff as have the NY Times, The Guardain (UK), and Der Spiegel (Germany).But Admiral Mullen .They and the media ARE gonna publish anything someone sends themFor the public to seeAnd To make ad moneyComeon!This is your problem buddy.The State Department dumps all this low-level stuff on the closed military net and a private first class has the ability to access it.AND!Send it somewhere else?YOU.The Secretaries of State and Defense and the White House are asleep at wheel on thisNOT WikileaksTell ya what Id doId have a review of the systemThen I would order 95% of the Secret stuff dumped to the PUBLIC.Yep.I heard me right.Then I have the State Department STOP using the military net and go to a commercial company and set up THEIR OWN back channel..Finally..

Lugar, spoke to members of the news media on Wednesday about the arms treaty with Russia. ]It is a role Mrs. Clinton expects to play frequently in coming months, as the White House girds for a more hostile Congress bent on challenging or even blocking the Obama administrations foreign policy agenda, whether arms control, the Middle East peace process, the war in Afghanistan or the tentative outreach to Cuba.There will be differences about the best way to proceed, she said in an interview. I do hope that the new Congress respects the time-honored tradition of leaving politics at the waters edge.With eight years in the Senate, half in the minority, and a reputation for getting along with Republicans, Mrs. Clinton is well equipped to be an emissary to Congress, several administration officials said. But the blow to the so-called New Start treaty  despite two dozen meetings and phone calls by Mrs. Clinton  shows that her skills may not be enough in this combative political environment.Mrs. Clinton told Senate and House leaders on Wednesday that the administration was determined to get New Start approved, despite the surprise announcement Tuesday by SenatorJon Kyl of Arizona, the Republican point man on the issue, thathe could not foresee a vote in the lame-duck session.She said she planned to contact Mr. Kyl in coming days.I understand the concerns my former colleagues have about this treaty, Mrs. Clinton said. Theres a lot more outreach that needs to be done.She has already lobbied Mr. Kyl twice, once in person and once by phone, teaming with Vice PresidentJoseph R. Biden Jr. And it is not clear what else the White House can do to cajole him.The administration has pledged an additional $4.1 billion to modernize the nationsnuclear weapons complex, on top of an existing $80 billion over 10 years. Mr. Kyl had sought the financing in return for not blocking the treaty, which reduces nuclear stockpiles in the United States and RussiaMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Politics, Updates, WomenFormer Senator, Secretary of State Clinton, The White HouseRead moreChange coming to Defense high command at the Pentagon.November 7, 2010jamesb1014 commentsQuestion?..Does General David Petraeus get the Chair of the Joint Chiefs when Admiral Mullen steps down as a thank you for his demotion to the Afghan/Pak theater commander?Who replaces Secretary of Defense Gates?Whoever it is .will never be able to step to Secretary of State Clinton in statue[ Clinton, Gates and Mullen ]Defense SecretaryRobert M. Gates has said he plans to retire next year, while the terms of four members of theJoint Chiefs of Staff are scheduled to end: Adm.Mike Mullen, the chairman; Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman; Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief; and Adm. Gary Roughead, the chief of naval operations.Andrew J. Bacevich, a retired Army officer who is a professor of history and international relations atBoston University, said this round of replacements, coming after two years of difficult and sometimes intense wrangling over how to carry on the war in Afghanistan, is particularly important, and is likely to prove particularly difficult.The challenge facing the president, Mr. Bacevich said, will be to identify leaders who will provide him with disinterested advice, informed by a concern for the national interest, and, in doing so, to avoid either the appearance or the reality of politicizing the senior leadership.At the top of the new pantheon of military power, the president needs a heavyweight to succeed Mr. Gates, an unexpected holdover from the Bush administration who stayed longer than many expected to become perhaps the most influential member of the Obama cabinetMore..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Military, Politics, Updates, WomenChair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm Mullen, Chief of Naval Ops, Defense Dept Management, Presdient Obama, Sec Army, Sec Navy, Sec of Defense, Sec of State Hillary Clinton, The Pentagon, The White House, Vice Joint Chief ChairRead moreIts Friday  and West Wing Week.Talkandpolitics.November 5, 2010jamesb101No commentsNice clip this weekDownload Video or MP3 More..Talkandpolitcs..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesBlogs, Talkandpolitics @ Politicaldog101, The West Wing Weekly Video Blog, The White HouseRead moreNASA will probably get at least THREE more shuttle flightsOctober 12, 2010jamesb101No commentsMaybe in coming to their senses.The White House and Congress can string along a flight or two a year for a while until the Orion and private companies get their programs up and running so that the US can maintain a manned presence in space travel.Smaller crewsless ambitious.Cheaper.But still going.*********Only two shuttle launches officially remain, with the next one coming up Nov. 1. The third, yet-to-be-formalized mission would take place next June. Atlantis already is being prepped in case it needs to rescue the crew of Endeavour, set to fly in February.Only four astronauts  instead of the usual six or seven  are assigned to that rescue mission. The crew size will remain the same if NASA gets the third shuttle flight. NASA wants to limit the number of crew members who would need to take refuge at the space station in case Atlantis is damaged at liftoff and couldnt be flown back to Earth.Those four shuttle astronauts would need to return on Soyuz spacecraft over the course of a year.The NASA Engineering and Safety Center reported last month that the risks associated with an additional shuttle flight  with no shuttle backup  were in line with others accepted by the shuttle and station programs in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster.Nelson said an additional flight will ease the impact of shuttle job cuts.Instead of the shuttle work force dropping precipitously off of a cliff, it smooths that transition as work begins on a new heavy-lift rocket and commercial spacecraft pick up steam, the senator said.

The president told them to buck up. And neither seemed to leave any doubt in separate interviews this week that press secretary Robert Gibbss exasperationover the summer with the professional left was the official view of the White House.But who, exactly, makes up this professional left that is so bothering President Barack Obama and his advisers? On Tuesday, Gibbss deputy, Bill Burton, made it clear that the occasionally critical cable personalities originally associated with this comment have the administrations blessing.If youre on the left, if youre somebody likeKeith Olbermann orRachel Maddow or one of the folks who helps to keep our government honest and pushes and prods to make sure that folks are true to progressive values, then [the president] thinks that those folks provide an invaluable service, Burton told reporters.Noticeably absent from Burtons embrace was anyone from the blogosphere once courted so avidly by the White House. Peter Daou thinks he knows why:With each passing day, Im beginning to realize that the crux of the problem for Obama is a handful of prominent progressive bloggers, among them Glenn Greenwald, John Aravosis, Digby, Marcy Wheeler and Jane Hamsher.Daou, a progressive strategist and blogger himself, offered the explanationin a post provocatively titled How a Handful of Liberal Bloggers Are Bringing Down the Obama Presidency, which put a face on Obamas critics and suggested why their criticism might be so irritating.The complaints these bloggers have launched against theObama administration are, Daou notes, exactly the same complaints they lodged against the Bush administration.Contrary to the straw man posed by Obama supporters, they arent complaining about pie in the sky wishes but about tangible acts of omission, from Gitmo to Afghanistan to the environment to gay rights and executive power, he wrote. The essence of their critique is that the White House lacks a moral compass.Aravosis is the editor of the progressive AMERICAblog, Digby writes theHullabaloo blog, Marcy Wheeler contributes to FireDogLake and won fame for her coverage of the Lewis Scooter Libby trial, and Hamsher founded FireDogLake.But Greenwald, who blogs at Salon, is first on the list for a reason. He was one of the first to turn on Obama and remains one of his loudest critics. A recent Greenwald post cited by Daou begins: At this point I didnt believe it was possible, but the Obama administration has just reached an all-new low in its civil liberties record....More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Politics, UpdatesThe Democratic left and Progresives, The White HouseRead moreThe White House MakeoverThe Oligarch Kings..September 1, 2010jamesb1011 commentWell, summers over and its back to work, and the Obamas have returned to a freshly decorated and refurbished Oval Office. And very nice it looks too. New carpet with the seal of the President woven into it, in as I understand it, the only place in the world outside of theHall of Presidents in Disney World Florida that is allowed to have this. There are a couple of inscriptions running round it from stirring speeches of the past. Uplifting, so they are. One says Government of the people by the people and for the people from Lincolns speech at Gettysburg and the other The welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally on the welfare of all of us by Teddy Roosevelt.Its very different from George Bushs day when there was a rug designed by the sainted Laura including stripes, which George always said suggested the optimism of a sunrise, but just gave everyone else a migraine.The White House has been the home of the Presidents since the 1790s, and as I have noted, 27 of its 43 inhabitants have been related to each other, and the First Ladies too! Its really very much the oligarchs family home. The Adams, Harrisons, Roosevelts, Bushes and all their relatives have found a happy home here. The Roosevelts in particular often had the second and third floors filled with the passing flotsam and jetsam of their families and friends some of whom lived there for years. So its worth theoligarchkings taking a tour of its history which is as strange as the families who inhabit it.Forwhat you see is not what you might imagine. Its certainly not the eighteenth century country plantation owners house it began life as.

Thats a 10% increase from the same period in the last fiscal year of the Bush administration and almost twice as many removals as in the period in 2005, according to the TRAC report.Earlier this year, ICE chief John Morton announced the agencys enforcement strategy would shift toward prioritizing the apprehension of illegal immigrants who had committed crimes rather than others unlawfully in the country. The stated immigration policy is actually being followed, said David Burnham, co-director of TRAC.A surge in deportations between fiscal years 2005 and 2009 was accomplished largely by catching noncitizens who had not committed any crimes other than sneaking across the border or entering the U.S. legally and overstaying their visas, the TRAC report said.Despite the new emphasis, fewer than half of those removed, or 49%, were criminal aliens, compared with 51% who were not.Matt Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the administration had fundamentally reformed immigration enforcement using our resources to focus on identifying and removing criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety.More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Politics, UpdatesComprehensive Immigration Reform, Criminal Immigrants, Deportation, ICE/Immigration & Customs Enforcement, Politics, The White HouseRead morePage 1 of 3123Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
