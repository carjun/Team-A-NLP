It was named for al-Qaeda, and says it is subordinate to that group and its leader Osama bin Laden, whose father was born in Yemen.Contents1 Ideology and formation2 Transformation into active al-Qaeda affiliate3 Activities4 Possible drone attacks5 Alleged members6 References7 External links[edit] Ideology and formationLike al-Qaeda, it opposes the Al Saud monarchy.[2] AQAP was formed in January 2009 from a merger of al Qaeda's Yemeni and Saudi branches.[3] The Saudi group had been effectively suppressed by the Saudi government, forcing its members to seek sanctuary in Yemen.[4][5] It is believed to have several hundred members.[3][edit] Transformation into active al-Qaeda affiliateAnwar al-Awlaki, believed to be an AQAP regional commanderAccording to U.S. counter-terrorism officials, Anwar al-Awlaki is the main force behind AQAP's decision to transform itself from a regional threat into al-Qaeda's most active affiliate outside Pakistan and Afghanistan.[6]The fraction of terrorist plots in the West that originated from Pakistan declined considerably from most of them (at the outset), to 75% in 2007, and to 50% in 2010, as al-Qaeda shifted to Somalia and Yemen.[7]U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton formally designated it a terrorist organization on December 14, 2009.[8] On August 25, 2010, The Washington Post said the CIA believed Yemen's branch of al-Qaida had surpassed its parent organization, Osama bin Laden's core group, as a threat to the U.S. homeland.[9]On August 26, Yemen claimed that U.S. officials had exaggerated the size and danger of al-Qaeda in Yemen, insisting also that fighting the jihadist network's local branch remained Sanaa's job.[10] A former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden warned of an escalation in fighting between al-Qaida and Yemeni authorities, and predicted the government would need outside intervention to stay in power.However, Ahmed al-Bahri told the Associated Press that attacks by al-Qaida in southern Yemen was an indication of its increasing strength.[11][edit] ActivitiesMain articles: USS Cole bombing, 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot, and 2010 cargo plane bomb plotYemen played an early role in al-Qaeda's history, as it is Osama bin Laden's ancestral homeland. Al Qaeda was active in Yemen well before the Saudi and Yemeni branches merged.USS Cole after the October 2000 attackAl Qaeda was responsible for the USS Cole bombing in October 2000 in the southern port of Aden, killing 17 U.S. sailors.[2] In 2002, an al Qaeda attack damaged a French supertanker in the Gulf of Aden.[2]The Global Terrorism Database attributes the 2004 Khobar massacre to the group.[12] In this guise, it is also known as "The Jerusalem Squadron".In addition to a number of attacks in Saudi Arabia, and the kidnap and murder of Paul Johnson in Riyadh in 2004, the group is suspected in connection with a bombing in Doha, Qatar, in March 2005.[13] For a chronology of recent Islamist militant attacks in Saudi Arabia, see Insurgency in Saudi Arabia.In the 2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, formerly known as Carlos Leon Bledsoe, a Muslim convert who had spent time in Yemen, on June 1, 2009 opened fire with an assault rifle in a drive-by shooting on soldiers in front of a United States military recruiting office in Little Rock, Arkansas, in a jihad attack. He killed Private William Long, and wounded Private Quinton Ezeagwula. He said that he was affiliated with and had been sent by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.[14][15][16]In August 2009, an AQAP suicide bomber tried to kill Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who heads Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism campaign and is a member of the Saudi royal family.[2] In 2009, AQAP also carried out a suicide attack in Yemen that killed four South Korean tourists.[2]Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the suspected Christmas Day bomberAQAP said it was responsible for Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's attempted Christmas Day bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit on December 25, 2009.[17] In that incident, Abdulmutallab reportedly tried to set off plastic explosives sewn to his underwear, but failed to detonate them properly.[2]On February 8, 2010, deputy leader Said Ali al-Shihri called for a regional holy war and blockade of the Red Sea to prevent shipments to Israel. In an audiotape he called upon Somalia's al-Shabaab militant group for assistance in the blockade.[18] AQAP was behind a suicide bombing aimed at the British ambassador in Yemen in April 2010, and a rocket fired at a British embassy vehicle in October 2010.[2]The 2010 cargo plane bomb plot was discovered on October 29, 2010, when two explosive-laden packages bound for the United States via cargo planes were found, based on intelligence received from government intelligence agencies, in the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The packages originated from Yemen, and were addressed to outdated addresses of two Jewish institutions in Chicago, Illinois, one of which was the Congregation Or Chadash, a LGBT synagogue.[19] On October 30, 2010, On November 5, 2010, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took responsibility for the plot.[20] It posted its acceptance of responsibility on a number of radical Islamist websites monitored by the SITE Intelligence Group and the NEFA Foundation, and wrote: "We will continue to strike blows against American interests and the interest of America's allies." It also claimed responsibility for the crash of a UPS Boeing 747-400 cargo plane in Dubai on September 3; U.S. and United Arab Emirates investigators had said they had not found any evidence of terrorist involvement in that incident. The statement continued: "since both operations were successful, we intend to spread the idea to our mujahedeen brothers in the world and enlarge the circle of its application to include civilian aircraft in the West as well as cargo aircraft."[21][20][22][23] American authorities had said they believed that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the plot.[19] Officials in the United Kingdom and the United States believe that it is most likely that the bombs were designed to destroy the planes carrying them.[24]In November 2010 the group announced a strategy, called "Operation Hemorrhage", that it said was designed to capitalize on the "security phobia that is sweeping America." The program would call for a large number of inexpensive, small-scale attacks against United States interests with the intent of weakening the U.S. economy.[25]The group also publishes the online magazines Voice of Jihad and Inspire.[edit] Possible drone attacksMain article: Targeted killingPredator droneThe White House, in an effort to turn up the heat against al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, is considering adding the CIA's armed Predator drones to the fight, two U.S. officials said. The drones are among CIA resources that could be assigned to an existing mission by U.S. special operations forces. The official said such options were in the planning stages, and would be put into effect only with the cooperation of the Yemeni leadership in Sanaa.A CIA targeted killing drone strike made headlines in Yemen in November 2002, when it killed an American citizen along with a group of al-Qaida operatives. Drones became shorthand in Yemen for a weak government allowing foreign forces to have their way.[26][27][edit] Alleged membersSaid Ali Al Shiri, Mohamed Atiq Awayd Al Harbi, and two other men in an AQAP video in January 2009In February 2006, 23 prisoners suspected of being al-Qaeda members escaped from a Yemeni high-security prison, reportedly with the aid of some Yemeni security forces. One of the prisoners, Naser al-Wuhayshi, was announced as the leader of AQAP.[3] He was once a close associate of bin Laden.[2] Another prisoner, Qassim al-Raimi, became the AQAP military commander and the third-highest-ranking figure in the group.[15] Analysts credit his talent for innovation, organizational skills, and ability to recruit for establishing a powerful, cohesive unit.[28] He has also been able to take advantage of Yemens "slow collapse into near-anarchy. Widespread corruption, growing poverty and internal fragmentation have helped make Yemen a breeding ground for terror."[28] Yemeni security officials announced that al-Raimi and five other al-Qaida operatives were killed in an airstrike on Jan 16, 2010.[15][29]The next year, Wuhayshi made Said Ali al-Shihri his deputy after he was released from six years' incarceration in Guantanamo Bay in December 2007 to a Saudi rehabilitation program, from which he disappeared. Another Guantanamo detainee released to a Saudi rehabilitation program, Ibrahim Suleiman al-Rubaysh, also disappeared and is now described as the mufti, or theological guide, to AQAP. Anwar al-Awlaki also plays a crucial role for AQAP.Gregory Johnsen, of Princeton University, an expert on Yemen, said there was evidence that al-Qa'ida was building a powerful support base among the tribes, even marrying into local tribes.[30] Another Yemeni analyst, Barak Barfi, discounted claims that marriage between the militant group and Yemeni tribes is a widespread practice, though he agrees that the bulk of AQAP members hail from the tribes.[31]Reportedly, as many as 20 Islamist British nationals traveled to Yemen in 2009 to be trained by AQAP.[32]The following is a list of people who have been purported to be AQAP members. Most, but not all, are or were Saudi nationals. Roughly half have appeared on Saudi "most wanted" lists. In the left column is the rank of each member in the original 2003 list of the 26 most wanted.EnglishArabicYousif Saleh Fahd al-'Uyayri (or Ayyiri, etc.)   first operational leader of AQAP, writer, and webmaster, killed June 2003 in Saudi Arabia[33]3Khalid Ali bin Ali Hajj    leader, killed in Riyadh March or April 2004[34]1Abdulaziz Issa Abdul-Muhsin al-Muqrin     leader, killed in Riyadh 18 June 2004[35][36][37]5Saleh Muhammad 'Audhuallah al-'Alawi al-Oufi     leader, killed 17 or 18 August 2005 in Madinah[38]2Rakan Muhsin Mohammed al-Saikhan   killed 12 April 2004 in Riyadh7Saud Hamoud 'Abid al-Qatini al-'Otaibi    senior member, one of 15 killed in a 3-day battle in Ar Rass April 2005[39]4Abdul Kareem Al-Majati  Moroccan, killed with Saud al-Otaibi at Ar Rass,[39] was wanted in the USA under the name Karim El Mejjati6Ibrahim Muhammad Abdullah al-Rais    killed 8 December 2003 in Riyadh8Ahmad Abdul-Rahman Saqr al-Fadhli   killed 22 April 2004 in Jeddah9Sultan Jubran Sultan al-Qahtani alias Zubayr Al-Rimi   q.v., killed 23 September 2003 in Jizan10Abdullah Saud Al-Siba'i   killed 29 December 2004[40]11Faisal Abdul-Rahman Abdullah al-Dakhil   killed with al-Muqrin[36]12Faris al-Zaharani   ideologue, captured 5 August 2004 in Abha[41]13Khalid Mobarak Habeeb-Allah al-Qurashi    killed 22 April 2004 in Jeddah14Mansoor Muhammad Ahmad Faqeeh   surrendered 30 December 2003 in Najran15'Issa Saad Muhammad bin 'Ushan    ideologue, killed 20 July 2004 in Riyadh16Talib Saud Abdullah Al Talib    at large; (last of the original 26)17Mustafa Ibrahim Muhammad Mubaraki   killed 22 April 2004 in Jeddah18Abdul-Majiid Mohammed al-Mani'   ideologue, killed 12 October 2004 in Riyadh[42]19Nasir Rashid Nasir Al-Rashid   killed 12 April 2004 in RiyadhSultan bin Bajad Al-Otaibi   spokesman[43] and writer for al-Qaeda, killed 28 or 29 December 2004[44]20Bandar Abdul-Rahman Abdullah al-Dakhil   killed December 2004[44]21Othman Hadi Al Maqboul Almardy al-'Amari    recanted, under an amnesty deal, 28 June 2004 in Namas[45][46]22Talal A'nbar Ahmad 'Anbari   killed 22 April 2004 in Jeddah23'Amir Muhsin Moreef Al Zaidan Al-Shihri     killed 6 November 2003 in Riyadh[47]24Abdullah Muhammad Rashid al-Rashoud    q.v., ideologue, killed May or June 2005 in Iraq25Abdulrahman Mohammad Mohammad Yazji   killed 6 April 2005[40]26Hosain Mohammad Alhasaki  Moroccan, held in Belgium[40]Turki N.
