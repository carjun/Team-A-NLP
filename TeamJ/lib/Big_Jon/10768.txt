Wills struck up a close bond with David Beckham when they teamed up to lead Englands bid to host footballs 2018 World Cup. The former England skipper and his wife Victoria were among the first to congratulate the royal couple on their engagement last week. David texted Wills as soon as he heard, and Wills told him an invite was on its way. David and Victoria were both thrilled and cant wait, a Royal source said. David, 35, and style icon Victoria, 36, will join a select number of A-list celebrities, including Sir Elton JohnElton John and Sir Paul McCartneyPaul McCartney, for the ceremony at Westminster Abbey on April 29 next year. President Obama and wife Michelle are also on the guest list, which is expected to be announced at the end of February, when Wills and Kate have received RSVPs. Theyre thinking carefully about which charities to invite, but they have pretty much decided on the friends they want there. Because they do mix with celebs, there will be quite a few there. Its the hottest ticket in town. There wont be many saying sorry, were busy that day. The Beckhams sent a card and some flowers, and Victoria is already thinking about dresses. Becks meets William  who is President of the Football Association  in Zurich this week to lobby for Englands World Cup campaign. He will travel without his fiance Kate in his official FA role, and is seen as a huge asset to the national bid. The friendship between the princes and the Beckhams dates back to 1998, when Prince Charles invited Victoria and the Spice Girls to his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire for tea as a treat for 13-year-old Prince Harry. This week Sir Elton said he would probably sing at the wedding, reprising his famous performance at Princess Dianas funeral in 1997.         1 of 9         David Beckham      Elnur763 is based in Baku, Bak, Azerbaijan,and is Stringer for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (65.3%) United Kingdom (6.7%) Canada (5.3%) Germany (5.3%) 9 other countries (12.0%)           READ MORE: Michelle, Spice Girls, Victoria Beckham, British people, royal, English people, England, Football in the United Kingdom, Beckhams, human interest, entertainment-news, Obama, United Kingdom, William, Middleton, Charles, Diana, Princess of Wales, Prince of Wales, Harry, Elton John, Prince William of Wales, Paul McCartney, David Beckham, Kate, MIX   More News From: Middleton :  United Kingdom     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         William & Kates Royal Wedding invites David Bedkham with his wife By: safdarjaved      Prince William and Kate Middleton who will be started new life in April next year,2011, invited in their wedding David Beckham and his fashionable wife Victoria in Westminister Abbey in London on April, 29, 2011.The famous couple will joinother celebrity elite such as British singers Sir Elton John and SirPaul McCartney at the most-...  14 days ago     Royal Wedding: Beckhams Invites to William and Kate Middleton By: safdarjaved      David Beckham invites to a royal wedding at least the story BritainsFamily.David Beckham who is English national soccer ace David Beckham and his wife Victoria are among the guests invited to the Prince William and Kate Middleton, set at Westminster Abbey in London on April 29,2011.The famous couple ...  about 1 month ago     Beckhams invited to royal wedding of William and Kate By: Zahidhameed      Soccer ace David Beckham and his stunning and fashionable spouse Victoriahave been invited to attend the marriage ceremony of Kate Middleton and PrinceWilliam taking place on April 29, next year.The famous couple is amongst the top celebrity elite such as British singersSir Elton John and Sir Paul McCartney which will attend ...  about 1 month ago     Interesting tit bits about Prince William and Kate By: swarnam      This is the second round of interesting tit bits about Prince William and Kate to just spice up your day.
