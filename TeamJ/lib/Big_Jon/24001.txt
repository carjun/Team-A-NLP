Prosecutors had alleged that Beardall lied to insurance regulators who were investigating a previous embezzlementby Renzi that helped fund the Congressman's first campaign.Beardall was acquitted onall charges.The government's case was much stronger in Lequire's case.

Samuel Wurzelbacher, better known as "Joe the Plumber," the conservative icon from the 2008 presidential election, paid a visit to the state capitol to oppose Governor Jan Brewer's proposed one-cent sales tax increase and to help organize Arizona's budding Tea Party movement."The Plumber" spoke to dozens of tea-baggers as part of a rally organized by the anti-tax organization "Ax the Tax," but Wurzelbacher didn't seem entirely sure what he was opposing.In a video floating around Youtube, Wurzelbacher is asked point-blank why he opposes the tax but sidesteps the direct question, saying, "It's a bad idea to raise taxes, period," before attempting to answer the question with a nervous question of his own.Check out the video below.

But, in a strange twist of fate, after Zatari was fired in September 2009, Auther was actually given her job.As New Times reported at the time, Auther had come under fire for ordering the state board that governs psychologists to work to repeal a law they'd previously lobbied state legislators to pass. The psychologists' board believed that Auther, as the governor's liasion to the agency, was speaking on behalf of Governor Jan Brewer -- but New Times learned that wasn't the case. The governor's office wanted a few minor fixes, not repeal.We discussed our findings with the governor's spokesman, Paul Senseman, on Friday, September 25. We even faxed him some relevant documents detailing Auther's overreaching demands to the psychologists' board.The following Tuesday, Zatari was told that her services were no longer needed -- and, within days, Jeri Auther was moved to the position instead. At the time, we assumed that Governor Brewer needed to pull Auther out of the liasion job, pronto. We thought that the administrator job at the governor's council, or GRRC, merely provided a safe landing. But Zatari's notice of claim, filed with the state two weeks ago, tells a more complicated tale.

If you'll recall, Chandler police recommended charges of theft and tampering with a political sign -- both misdemeanors -- following an investigation.The sordid affairbegan after the Republican state senator yankedout a sign supportinga Democratic candidate near a polling place on election day. OneDemocratic activist, an elderly lady named Ruth Levin, claims Huppenthal pulled the sign from her hand after he pulled it from the ground. Sheopened his car door as he was driving away and grabbed a business card.The scene was criticized in a recent blog post by the Democratic Diva, Donna Gratehouse, who noted that during the July 29 bench trial, Huppenthal said, "I started to pull out and all of the sudden she opened the door ... It scared the heck out of me, I thought I was being car-jacked by an older woman."

The Yellow Sheet reporter sent Benson a statement describing his "humiliating" termination:"The publisher and I had a disagreement on Aug. 7 over promised freelance work for Arizona Capitol Times after retirement. She demanded I leave immediately," Riske wrote the Insider in a statement. "The publisher appointed a friend to stand over me as I cleaned out my desk, all in front of two dear, perplexed colleagues. It was a humiliating and scarring way to end a 43-year career in journalism."

How about a hospital, a state park, and, oh yeah, the state capitol.We reported on this a few weeks ago, and believe us, we can't believe this is actually happening either.In the last few weeks, about two dozen real estate investors have contacted state officials about the Legislatures proposal to sell 32 state owned facilities, including the state capitol."There is a lot of interest. I've received a lot of phone calls. I'mjust compiling a list of interested investors," Alan Ecker, legislative liaison for the Department of Administration officials tells the Arizona Guardian. "As thingsmove along, we'll be contacting all of those parties."The proposal hopes to bring in about $730 million to help bridge the state's current $3.5 billion budget gap.Once the buildings are sold, the plan calls for the state to lease the properties back from the new owner, pay rent for a few years, and hopefully buy the buildings back when it's out of the red.Just think of it as a big pawn shop.

"I'd prefer he be here right now, but in hindsight, we didn't have enough votes the other day. So it didn't make much of a difference."

Darrell Issa to the rescue!A California congressman has asked White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to answer to allegations that he attempted to bully our very own Governor Jan Brewer.In a scathing letter today, Congressman Darrell Issa accused Emanuel of "resorting to the playbook of the Chicago political machine" when he directed Cabinet members to send letters to Brewer, threatening to pull federal stimulus funds if she didn't take a position on whether or not he stumulus wasworking. "The fact that the letters were coordinated by you to maximize the level of intimidation is supported by the timing, structure, and content of each letter," Issa wrote to Emanuel. "Not only were the four letters all sent the day following Senator Kyl's remarks, but they were also remarkably similar in tone and sentence structure."
