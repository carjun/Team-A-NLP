While this is primarily intended to assist those with disabilities, it can be helpful to all readers. Articles adhering to the following guidelines are easier to read and edit by those Wikipedians with and without disabilities.Contents1 Article structure1.1 Lead section1.2 Headings1.3 Section structure1.4 Resolution2 Text3 Links4 Color5 Block elements5.1 Lists5.1.1 Horizontal lists5.2 Tables5.2.1 Data tables5.2.2 Layout tables5.3 Infoboxes6 Other languages7 Images8 Videos and animations9 Styles and markup options9.1 Best practice: Use Wikimarkup and CSS in preference to alternatives9.2 Users with limited CSS/JavaScript support10 Keyboard shortcuts11 See also12 References13 External links[edit] Article structure[edit] Lead sectionAs explained in detail at Wikipedia:Lead section#Elements of the lead, the lead section may contain optional elements presented in the following order: disambiguation links (dablinks), maintenance tags, infoboxes, images, navigational boxes (navigational templates), introductory text, and table of contents, moving to the heading of the first section.[edit] HeadingsHeadings should be descriptive and in a consistent order (See alsoReferencesFurther readingExternal links).Headings should be nested sequentially, starting with level 2 (==), then level 3 (===) and so on (level 1 is not used, as this is the auto-generated page title), neither using random heading levels (e.g. selected for emphasis, which is not the purpose of headings), nor skipping parts of the sequence.Heading use (and misuse) examplesCorrectRandom/chaoticSkipping levels[Article lead here]==Section== [level 2]===Sub-section=== [3]==Section== [2]===Sub-section=== [3]====Sub-sub-section==== [4]==Section== [2][Article lead here]====Section?==== [4]===Section?=== [3]==Section?== [2]==Section?== [2]====Section?==== [4]===Section?=== [2][Article lead here][Level-2 section missing here]===Section?=== [3]==Section== [2][Level-3 sub-section missing here]====Sub-section?==== [4]==Section== [2][edit] Section structureAs explained above for the lead section, each section should have a specific structure:<!-- CORRECT CODE -->== Foo bars =={{main|Foo bar}}{{cleanup-section}}[[Image:...|Typical Foo bar]]A foo bar ...Note also that the image should be inside the section it belongs to (after the header and after any links to other articles), and not just before the header for similar reasons.[edit] ResolutionWikipedia articles should be accessible to readers using devices with small screens, or to readers using monitors with a low resolution. The lowest resolution that it is considered possible to support without adversely affecting other users is 800x600; all articles should look acceptable at this resolution without excessive horizontal scrolling. This is sometimes an issue in articles with multiple images on both sides of the screen; although lower resolutions will tend to stretch paragraphs vertically, moving images apart in that direction, be careful not to add images or other floating content on both sides of the screen simultaneously. Large tables and images can also create problems; sometimes horizontal scrolling is unavoidable, but consider restructuring wide tables to extend vertically rather than horizontally.[edit] TextSpelling errors, such as "initative" instead of "initiative", can dramatically affect the sound of the text when it is read by a speech synthesizer, which can make it more difficult to read.In articles, do not use strikethrough to remove objectionable text. Either comment it out with "<!--" and "-->" or remove it entirely. By default, most screen readers do not indicate presentational text attributes (bold, italic, underline) or even semantic text attributes (emphasis, importance, text deletion), so struck-out text is read normally along with any other text. (Editors who participate in Wikipedia policy and deletion debates are advised to turn on the sounding of text attributes when doing so, as struck text is very common in Wikipedia-internal discussions.)Screen readers without Unicode support will read a character outside Latin-1 as a question mark, and even in the latest version of JAWS, the most popular screen reader, Unicode characters are very difficult to read.Provide a transliteration for all text in a non-Latin writing system where the non-Latin character is important in the original context such as names, places, things etc.Do not use unpronounceable symbols such as  (a heart symbol); use images with alt text instead.[1]Symbols that cause problems for screen readers may already have templates created to substitute an image with alt text. An example is {{}}; see Category:Image insertion templates for more.Do not use techniques that require interaction to provide information, such as tooltips or any other "hover" text.When editing, never break up a line unless absolutely necessary, as the easiest way to edit with a screen reader is to navigate line by line.You can change your individual display to show footnotes in full sized text by adding.references-small { font-size: 100%; }to your CSS page[edit] LinksDo not overlink. Screen readers put each link on its own line.Create good link descriptions, especially for external links (avoid "click here!", "this").[2][3]Avoid putting links in section headings. Some screen readers, such as versions of JAWS prior to 7.1, have significant difficulty correctly rendering such headers. Additionally, special characters such as brackets ("[") and curly brackets ("{") are invalid characters in HTML, which causes section headers to be invalid as HTML anchors. Using wikitext in section headers makes it more difficult to link to them internally as well.Use as little code as possible, so the text in the edit window is easier to read (for example: do not use [[clock|clocks]] when [[clock]]s will work).Do not use Unicode characters as icons; use an icon with alt text instead. For example, a character like "" can not be reproduced into useful text by a screen reader, and will usually be read as a question mark.[edit] ColorShortcuts:WP:COLORWP:COLOURWP:COLORSSee also: Help:Using colours, Wikipedia:Manual of Style (text formatting)#Color,and Category:Articles with images not understandable by color blind usersThis section is about the use of colors in articles.  For the civility essay dealing with colors, see Wikipedia:Don't edit war over the colour of templates.A pair of screenshots showing the effects of red/green colorblindness on legibilityColors are most commonly found in Wikipedia articles within templates and tables. To view the colors available, see List of colors. For technical assistance on how colors are used, see Help:Using colours.Articles that use color should keep accessibility in mind, as follows:Ensure that color is not the only way used to convey important information. Especially, do not use colored text unless its status is also indicated using another method such as italic emphasis or footnote labels. Otherwise, blind users or readers accessing Wikipedia through a printout or device without a color screen will not receive that information.Some readers of Wikipedia are partially or fully color blind. Ensure that the color combinations used in Wikipedia (infoboxes, navigational boxes, graphs, etc.) have an adequate contrast. Use a color scheme generator to select the colors, and tools for simulating color blind vision (colorfilter.wickline.org or vischeck.com) to check the result.Be aware of the contrast of both plain text and the red/blue/purple link text with the background and avoid clashes where possible (such as blue writing on a red background).If an article overuses colors, an alternative to correcting it is to add a tag such as ({{Overcolored}}/{{Overcoloured}}) to the top of the article to draw help from other editors in correcting the problem:This article or section may overuse color, making it hard to understand for color blind users. See the category page and WP:Colors for guidelines.Automated contrast and brightness checkersPages can be checked on-line with AccessColor, which analyzes the HTML source for a web page and the associated Cascading Style Sheets, and then calculates whether the color contrast and color brightness between the text and background colors conform with version 1.0 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.Color contrast for people with vision impairments, including color blindness, can be tested withThe Colour Contrast Analyser.The Firefox extension that use the draft algorithms from the World Wide Web Consortium.Safe color schemes from maps can be found from Color Brewer 2.0's.[edit] Block elements[edit] ListsSee also: Wikipedia:Lists#List stylesDo not separate items by leaving blank lines between them, even when using unordered or definition lists. If list items are separated by more than one line break, the HTML list tags will be ended, which makes it difficult to read the list with screen readers. For example:* One is a good number.* Two is a better number.* Three is the best number in the world.* But the number four should not be mentioned at all costs.will be read by a screen reader as: "List of 2 items: (bullet) One is a good number, (bullet) Two is a better number, list end. List of 1 items: (bullet) Three is the best number in the world, list end. List of 1 items: (bullet) But the number four should not be mentioned at all costs, list end." Improper formatting can more than triple the length of time it takes to read the list.[edit] Horizontal listsFor lists running across the page, the template {{flatlist}} and its partner {{endflatlist}} are available, to improve accessibility and semantic meaningfulness by marking up what is clearly a list, as such, rather than characters which are read out (e.g. "one dot two dot three dot...") by the kind of assistive software used by, for example, people who are blind. Alternatively, in templates and the like, such lists may be styled with the class "horizontal".[edit] TablesScreen readers and other web browsing tools make use of specific table tags to help users navigate the data contained within them.Use the correct wikitable pipe syntax to take advantage of all the features available. See meta:Help:Tables for more information on the special syntax used for tables. Do not solely use formatting, either from CSS or hardcoded styles, to create semantic meaning (eg, changing background colour).The technique of creating a multi-line infobox using matching embedded HTML <br /> tags in adjacent cells creates a visual row not reflected in the HTML table structure. This is a problem for users of screen readers which read tables cell by cell, html row by html row, not visual row by visual row. WikiProject Accessibility/Infobox accessibility is addressing this problem.[edit] Data tablesPriority: high (A accessibility level)Difficulty: easy (blend in nicely with editorial habits){| |+ [caption text]|-! scope="col" | [column header 1]! scope="col" | [column header 2]! scope="col" | [column header 3]|-! scope="row" | [row header 1]| [normal cell 1,2] || [normal cell 1,3]|-! scope="row" | [row header 2]| [normal cell 2,2] || [normal cell 2,3]...|}Caption ( |+ )A caption is a table's title, describing its nature.[WCAG-TECH 1]Row & column headers (! )Like the caption, these help present the information in a logical structure to visitors.[WCAG-TECH 2] The headers help screen readers render header information about data cells. For example, header information is spoken prior to the cell data, or header information is provided on request.[4]Scope of headers (! scope="col" | and! scope="row" | )This clearly identifies headers as either row headers or column headers. Headers can now be associated to corresponding cells.[WCAG-TECH 3]Wikipedia:Manual of Style (accessibility)/Data tables tutorial provides detailed requirements about:Correct table captionsCorrect headers structureImages and colorAvoiding nested tables[edit] Layout tablesSome navboxes, series templates, and infoboxes are made using tables.Avoid using tables for layout purposes only. The best option is to use HTML's <div> blocks and style attributes because they provide flexibility. For example, see {{Navbox}}.For simple layouts tables can be an option. Especially if the only point of the table is to get a floating effect, then align="right" etc. will work with some browsers not supporting CSS at all. This is in fact a verbose approximation of <div> plus CSS, and not the design sin known as (nested) "table layout".However, to avoid accessibility barriers, when using tables for layout purposes do not use any caption, row, or column headers, and also no summary attribute. These structural table elements should be used only for data tables. Do not use structural elements for presentation purposes, use style sheets. For Wiki table markup this means to avoid "!" (=<th> in XHTML) in such cases:{| class="toccolours" width="94%"| align="center" bgcolor="#ccccff" | '''Title'''|-| [normal cell] || [normal cell]|-| [normal cell] || [normal cell]|}For example, see {{Navbox}}[edit] InfoboxesSee the HTML breaks problem.[edit] Other languagesMain page: Template:Lang/doc#RationaleNon-English words or phrases should be encased in {{lang}}, which uses ISO639 language codes, thus:{{lang|fr|Assemble nationale}}which renders asAssemble nationale.[edit] ImagesFurther information: Wikipedia:Alternative text for images, Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Images, Wikipedia:Image use policy#SizeImages should include an alt attribute, even an empty one, that acts as a substitute for the image for blind readers, search-spiders, and other non-visual users. If additional alt text is added it should be succinct, or should refer the reader to the caption or adjacent text: see WP:ALT for more information.Images should contain a caption, either using the built in image syntax or a secondary line of text. The caption should concisely describe the meaning of the image, the essential information it is trying to convey.Where possible, any charts or diagrams should have a text equivalent, or should be well-described so that users who are unable to see the image can gain some understanding of the concept.Detailed image descriptions, where not appropriate for an article, should be placed on the image description page, with a note saying that activating the image link will lead to a more detailed description.Images should be inside the section they belong to (after the heading and after any links to other articles), and not in the heading. See Wikipedia:Picture tutorial for more information.This guideline includes alt text for LaTeX-formatted equations in <math> mode.[edit] Videos and animationsFurther information: Wikipedia:Media help and Wikipedia:Creation and usage of media filesIn order to be accessible, an animation (GIF  Graphics Interchange Format) should either:not exceed a duration of five seconds (which results in making it a purely decorative element),[5] orbe equipped with control functions (stop, pause, play).[6]In short, most animated GIFs should be converted to video (to learn how, see the tutorial converting animated GIFs to Theora OGG).Although these are not yet supported by MediaWiki as of August 2010,[7] a video also should have subtitles and a text version (alt-text) of its content.[8][9] A good way to satisfy these needs is to make sure that the information in the video is also present in the prose text of the article.[edit] Styles and markup optionsShortcut:WP:Deviations[edit] Best practice: Use Wikimarkup and CSS in preference to alternativesIn general, articles should use wikimarkup in preference to the limited set of allowed HTML elements. In particular, do not use the HTML style tags <i> and <b> to format text; it is preferable to use Wiki markup '' or ''', or logical style tags. Of course there are natural exceptions: it may be beneficial to use <u></u> tags to indicate something like an example of an unclickable link. The <font> tag should also be avoided in article text; use logical style tags like <em>, <code>, or <strong> to emphasise semantic differences. Use <small> and <big> semantic tags to change font size, rather than setting it explicitly with the font-size= style attribute.In general, styles for tables and other block-level elements should be set using CSS classes, not with inline style attributes. This is because the site-wide CSS is more carefully tested to ensure compatibility with a wide range of browsers; it also creates a greater degree of professionalism by ensuring a consistent appearance between articles. Deviations from standard conventions are acceptable where they create a semantic distinction (for instance, the infoboxes and navigational templates relating to The Simpsons use a yellow colour-scheme instead of the customary mauve, to tie in with the dominant colour in the series) but should not be used gratuitously.[edit] Users with limited CSS/JavaScript support See also: Wikipedia:Manual of style#Scrolling lists and collapsible contentWikipedia articles should be accessible to readers using browsers and devices which have limited or no support for JavaScript or Cascading Style Sheets. At the same time, it is recognised that it is impossible to provide the same quality of appearance to such users without unnecessarily avoiding features that would benefit users with more capable browsers. As such, features which would cause content to be hidden or corrupted when CSS and/or JavaScript is unavailable must not be used. This includes techniques such as the hiddenStructure method for hiding table content which produces incomprehensible output without CSS and some implementations of the NavFrame collapsing code which can make content inaccessible without JavaScript support. However, consideration for users without CSS or JavaScript should extend mainly to making sure that their reading experience is possible; it is recognised that it will inevitably be inferior.To accommodate these considerations, test any potentially disruptive changes with JavaScript and/or CSS disabled. In Firefox, this can be done easily with the WebDeveloper extension; JavaScript can be disabled in IE in the 'Options' screen. Be particularly careful with inline CSS effects, which are not supported by several browsers, media, and XHTML versions.[edit] Keyboard shortcutsFurther information: Wikipedia:Keyboard shortcutsNumerous keyboard shortcuts for common Wikipedia tasks exist by default.
