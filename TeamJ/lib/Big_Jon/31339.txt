Drivers in the USA could be paying as much as $3.75 a gallon for gas this spring, oil experts predict.Prices at the gas pump have inched up all year as the cost of crude oil neared $100 a barrel. On Christmas Day, the average nationwide price of self-serve regular hit $3, a record for that day. By year's end, the average price reached $3.06. Prices creeping toward $4 a gallon could have dire consequences for some industries and slow the economic recovery, analysts say. ~~~~"We learned in 2008 that $4-a-gallon gas is a deal-breaker for the economy," says Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. "If it happens, it's not sustainable. There's only so much the consumer will bear."(more)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Somewhere between $3.50 a gallon and $4.00 a gallon our economy will hit a wall.  (It took $4.00 a gallon to do it in 2008 but our unemployment is higher now and people have less to spend now.)  We will be dragged out of this tepid recovery and be heading deeper into recession again.    Oil prices are only going to keep rising.  When China and India start revving up like they were before this Golden Age of Trickle Down Prosperity ( viz. The Republican Dystopia)  we will be looking fondly back at the days of $3.50 a gallon gasoline.   Unfortunately, some approaches to reduce gasoline demand (such as hybrids and PHEVs) will take 20 years to realize much success. That will be about 18 years too late to save our economy.  WHEN WILL PEOPLE REALIZE YOU CAN REPLACE THE FUEL MUCH QUICKER THAN YOU CAN REPLACE THE CARS THAT BURN THE FUEL ?   POSSIBLE WAY TO AVERT INDEFINITE RECESSION:  Reduce the tariff on Brazilian ethanol and continue support of the domestic ethanol industry (as needed) so as to try to achieve 15% of our fuel supply being met with ethanol in as short a time as possible (i.e. a few years).  This will help contain (though probably not entirely prevent)  the great energy price rise (see below for what more we can do).  After reaching 15% of the fuel supply work towards 20% and then 25% (or more).  Without doing this, we are headed for another Recession/Depression (given the weakened state of the economy) and that will not help the adoption of the more expensive green technologies which we certainly need, such as Hybrids and PHEVs.   If significant numbers of people are unemployed you aren't going to see sales of Hybrids and electrics jumping off the charts.    Without this, get ready, the economy will be turning back down in about two years.   But, then there is this approach:  http://www.3wheelmotorcycle.com / To gain the full advantage of ethanol we need to start making the ethanol direct injection engine in large numbers. To do more to reduce demand for gas, relatively quickly and cheaply, compared to hybrids and PHEVs, we need to impress upon the auto manufacturers the need to  start making cars with the MIT designed Ethanol Direct Injection Engine which offers comparable fuel consumption improvements (30% reduction... with Stop Start ignition... 35% to 40% reduction.) as standard hybrid cars at about one third to one fourth the cost (about $1,000 to $1,600 marginal cost).  The lower cost obviously makes this technology more obtainable to more people and would enable more rapid acceptance by the public. This engine does not require E85 to do this. It only operates on  about 5% ethanol (E85 will do) adn 95% gasoline to achieve these fuel efficiency gains.   To encourage the auto manuacturers to start making these engines we need many more ethanol blender pumps available to people.  This would make a mass market for this engine a real possibility, which is what the auto companies need to invest in this technology.  They have to be able to sell enough of them to make the investment pay off.  THen again there's always this approach:  http://www.3wheelmotorcycle.com /Refresh|+6 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadObama needs to call up those Sheiks and tell them to turn on those spigotsrpannierJan-03-11 06:58 PM#1and I wonder how much of the $92 a barrel (currently) goes to al Kaida et al.JohnWxyJan-03-11 07:03 PM#2Its about 3.89 a gallon here.

The roll resistance of the Studded tires is noticeable on your first ride, but not that much more then regular slicks.  When the weather breaks off comes the studs and on go the slicks for while the increase in roll resistance is NOT that much it is noticeable enough to want to change out of the studded tires as soon as the weather breaks.   I generally use my tires about six weeks to two months a year.  I wait till the first snow (not the first cold weather, in Western PA, we often get cold weather weeks before any snow of more then an inch or two so I wait for the snow and ice before I switch out of my slicks to the studs).

Giant is one of the reputable bike companies that offer an ebike.  Most of the Giant models use a brushed Direct Drive motor rather than a brushless hub motor, but there may be some newer models with a small front hub.  I don't like the batteries in the pannier, because it causes unnecessary drag.  If the batteries must be mounted in the rear, use a rack mount flat lithium battery or Lead batteries in a trunk.  My preference is a rear geared hub motor with a lithium triangle frame mounted battery, like this one: Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopKennah      (869 posts)Mon Jan-03-11 08:41 PMResponse to Reply #911.And those studded tires are WAY cool!Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCHIMO      (1000+ posts)Mon Jan-03-11 07:48 PMResponse to Original message7.It's All Smoke And mirrors.EIAs forecast is an energy fantasy land The recently released base case that will be used in the coming Annual Energy Outlook 2011 from the U.S. Department of Energys Energy Information Administration (EIA) paints a future of cheap and abundant energy for the U.S. economy over the next quarter of a century. But its underlying assumptions are no more credible than those that underpinned the equally optimistic forecasts released by the International Energy Agency. Which bring us to the EIAs oil price (CL-FT91.670.120.13%)forecast. Measured in todays dollars, the agency doesnt see oil getting to $125 a barrel until 2035. The $125-per-barrel oil price that the EIA has spotted on the very distant 25-year horizon, I believe, will actually be staring the agency in the face within the next 12 months. I leave it to others to assess what that will imply for the credibility of the rest of the EIAs outlook. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/comme... /Take the time to read his book.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopKolesar      (1000+ posts)      Tue Jan-04-11 08:07 PMResponse to Reply #723.Rubin slams the USEIA report, but he says nothing to support his contentionThat was not well written.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topjimlup      (1000+ posts)      Mon Jan-03-11 08:01 PMResponse to Original message8.FUUUUUDDDDDDDGeOnly I didn't say Fudge.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topdoc03      (1000+ posts)Mon Jan-03-11 08:44 PMResponse to Original message12.There goes all those jobs the cut in the payroll tax was supposed to create.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNMDemDist2      (1000+ posts)      Mon Jan-03-11 09:06 PMResponse to Original message13.hubby paid $3.07 yesterday for mid rangesighPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNNadir      (1000+ posts)      Mon Jan-03-11 09:19 PMResponse to Original message14.Really?

I NEVER SAID ETHANOL WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF FOSSIL FUEL    consumption for transportation... by itself.  (Also, the first post I made on this site re ethanol was 5  years ago.)    I have always said ethanol is one technology we can use to help solve the GHG emissions  and energy security problems due to our vast consumption of petroleum for transportation. There are obviously other technologies we will need to employ such as PHEVs and conventional hybrids.    In the past I have referred to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory study which concluded that we could meet 30% of our transportation fuel needs with ethanol (which projected that we would make cellulosic ethanol commercially feasible)..... I never said that ethanol would solve the problem of fossil fuel usage for transporation by itself NOR did I ever say it would solve the problem in 5 years.  The fact is we are faced with petroleum prices rising quickly and that these price increases will put our economy back into negative growth unless we do what we can to prevent this from happening.  Now, the petroleum price increases will come far faster than the hybrid and PHEV technologies can cope with.  THe fact remains that you can replace the fuel cars burn far faster than you can replace the cars that burn the fuel.   The quickest way we have of dealing with the rise in petroleum prices is to increase ethanol usage - by importing all the ethanol Brazil (or anyone else) can supply and combine that with what we can supply domestically.  This hopefully would buy time for us to start making every car powered with the Ethanol Direct Injection Engine which would give us an a 23% reduction in fuel consumption for every car sold.  Any ethanol supplied that exceeded the amount needed to operate the Ethanol direct injection engine would be used to displace gasoline and add to the reduced gasoline usage.   If we do not do this (which BTW I do not think we will do, at least not soon enough) then we are headed for another dip into declining economic growth rates and very poor job creation.  Too much of our money will be going overseas to support a growing economy at home.  And by the way, a moribund economy will NOT help the adoption of the more expensive electic car technologies.  It will only slow down the adoption of this much needed technology.  without the 2 steps I outlined above there is always.......

Increased supply of a comparable commodity will lower the price ofEdited on Thu Jan-06-11 05:27 PM by JohnWxy the competing commodities.  This is understood by everyone in business.  Brazil can supply ethanol at a price below the price of gasoline.  Increased supply of substitutable commodity will bring the price of the competing commodity down.  Increased supply of a substitutable commodity at an initially lower price will bring the competing commodity price down even more (first commodity forced to compete with cheaper substitutable commodity)  - the supplier of first commodity will have to take a cut in his margin to compete on price.  I didn't say increasing ethanol on the market would lower the price of gas.  What I do say is that it will reduce the increase in the price of gas.  I don't know if we can increase the supply of ethanol fast enough to actually cause the price of gas to go down.  I suppose it's possible but without knowing just now much the price of gas is going to go up (based on increased demand as economy strengthens) and not knowing just how much increased supply of ethanol can be achieved (in a relatively short time period.. 1 or 2 years) this is impossible to predict.  But what you can say is an increased supply of an equivalent (substitutable) commodity will reduce the price or limit the price increase of the commodities in competition.  This is a basic principle of market economics....that is...it is NOT bullshit.... NOTE: we really do not know what the real price of oil is since there are substantial tax breaks and program subsidies enjoyed by the oil and natural gas industries.  Estimates vary as to what the real price of oil is from $5.00 to $15.00 per gallo.  Most of that range depends upon whether the estimate includes the military costs involved in securing our supply of imported oil...
