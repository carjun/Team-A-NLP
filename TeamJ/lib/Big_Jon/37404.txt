A more detailed analysis of the legislation is forthcoming, the CBO said.The $230 billion estimate is higher than one from last year, largely because it now examines the effect of the law between 2012 and 2021 instead of an earlier window.On top of all of this .It appaers that Healthcare spending has actually grown slower in the past year( effected by the economy for sure )..So if the Healthcare law con cut spending WTF are the Republicans trying to upset things by going backwards?Many consumers decreased their use of health care goods and services, partly because they had lost employer-based private health insurance coverage and partly because their household income had declined, said Anne B. Martin, an economist and principal author of the report, issued by the office of the actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.In many cases, Ms. Martin said, people decided to forgo health care services they could not afford.The number of visits to doctors offices apparently declined. Manyhospitals reported fewer admissions, as patients put off medical procedures. Spending on dental services declined slightly. Many hospitals and other health care providers reduced their capital investments. Spending on doctors services in 2009 increased at the slowest pace since 1996, according to the new federal study, being published in the journal Health Affairs.***Republicans pounced on the new numbers. No one should take solace in the fact that health spending grew at a lower rate in 2009, said SenatorOrrin G. Hatch of Utah, who is in line to be the senior Republican on the Finance Committee.Mr. Hatch said the new health care law could lead to crushing increases in health costs and premiums.By contrast, the chiefMedicare actuary, Richard S. Foster, has estimated that the new law will lead to an increase of only nine-tenths of 1 percent in national health spending over 10 years.Uninsured people who gain coverage will use more health care, Mr. Foster said, but the law is also supposed to reduce the growth of Medicare payments to many health care providers..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Healthcare, Law, Politics, The Economy, WomenBudget Deficits, Cost to the Government, Democrats vs the GOP in the House, Repealing the Healthcare vote, republicans, The Healthcare LawRead moreNew GOP House member: Sick kids shouldnt get health insurance..Its too expensive for Insurance companies to cover.January 5, 2011jamesb1011 commentThats because if they do..It will put the Healthcare Insurance companies out of the business.Okay.What business are they in?Insurance.Or.robbing people of their premium money?Do you believe this shit?By Jed Lewison @ Dailykos..Meet Diane Black, the new GOP congresswoman from Tennessees sixth congressional district. Like most all of her GOP colleagues, shes eager to repeal health care reform. Why? Because she thinks its a really bad idea to require insurance companies to provide coverage for sick children.There is a mandate there that insurance companies must insure children up to the age of 24, and what we have found is that there are a lot of insurance companies that are just saying were not going to be in this business any longer, because we know that we cant survive if thats what were going to do.And the second piece of that was to insure children regardless of their health care history, and as a result of that, I know several health care insurance agents in my district who have said were just dropping any insurance for children whatsoever.First of all, the law allows parents to keep children on their insurance policy until age 26  not 24. But setting aside her ignorance of the most basic details about the bill, the bigger problem with Blacks argument is that shes saying insurance companies shouldnt be required to cover sick children because it might put them out of business.Basically, what Black wants is a world in which insurance companies can drop coverage for anybody who isnt completely healthy. Thats obviously a great business model  sell insurance to people who arent likely to need it, then drop coverage as soon as they get sick. But if insurance companies can cherry pick and only offer coverage to healthy people, then whats the point of insurance in the first place?One of the very best things in the new law is that insurance companies are required to offer insurance to everybody. That means they cant deny coverage to kids just because the kids happen to be sick. Diane Black and her GOP colleagues want to do away with that. They want insurance companies to be able to deny coverage to children who arent healthy. In other words, they want real life death panels. The only good thing you can say here is that at least Black had the courage to admit it.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Healthcare, Law, Media, Politics, The Economy, Updates, WomenHealthcare Inurance for sick kids, Rep.

These motions leave the majority to choose between voting against something popular, or voting to scuttle or complicate their own agenda. This is how Republicans managed to wrongfoot Democrats on the 9/11 health bill and other issues in the last couple Congresses.Democrats just offered their first motion to commit the new House rules. The goal? To amend the package to force new members to announce whether or not theyll be taking their government health care.To wit: Not later than 15 days after taking the oath of office, a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner shall notify the Clerk of whether that Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner elects to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.Republicans voted it down.More.

Fred Upton (R-MI) told Fox News that House Republicans have enough votes to repeal the health care law.Said Upton: As part of our pledge we said that we would bring up a vote to repeal health care early. That will happen before the presidents State of the Union address. We have 242 Republicans. There will be a significant number of Democrats, I think, that will join us. You will remember when that vote passed in the House, last March; it only passed by seven votes.Republicans dont expect the effort to get past the Senate but their strategy is to go after it provision by provision, which they think might work.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Healthcare, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesHouse vote to repeal trhe Healthcare Bill, Republicans/GOPRead moreSomething you should knowThe rules Congress passes Dont apply to them.That doesnt mean we change the Constitution.January 1, 2011jamesb1016 commentsSomeone send this to me.While its kinda good thing to point out.The fact about the CongressThe letter calls for a amendment to the Constitution.This is AGAIN about STATES RIGHTSSomething I am against.Once the genie is out of the box .WTF knows what could happen?My 5 cents says it will never see the light of day.(there have been 700 tries to Amend the Constitution by single states, several of them have reached the magic 38 number to no availThat is because..

This will get national attention if other news networks will broadcast it. When you add this to the below, just where will all of it stop?35 States file lawsuit against the Federal GovernmentGovernors of 35 states have filed suit against the Federal Government for imposing unlawful burdens upon them. It only takes 38 (of the 50) States to convene aConstitutional Convention.This will take less than thirty seconds to read. If you agree, please pass it on.This is an idea that we should address.For too long we have been too complacent about the workings of Congress. Many citizens had no idea thatmembers of Congress could retire with the same pay after only one term, that they specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment) while ordinary citizens must live under those laws. The latest is to exempt themselves from theHealthcare Reform in all of its forms. Somehow, that doesnt seem logical. We do not have an elite that is above the law.I truly dont care if they are Democrat, Republican, Independent or whatever. The self-serving must stop.If each person that receives this will forward it on to 20 people, in three days, most people inThe United States of America will have the message.

And elections have consequences.NY Times:Legislative leaders in at least half a dozen states say they will propose bills similar to a controversial law to fight illegal immigration that was adopted by Arizona last spring, even though a federal court has suspended central provisions of that statute.The efforts, led by Republicans, are part of a wave of state measures coming this year aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration.NEJM:Can Congress Make You Buy Broccoli? And Why Thats a Hard QuestionThe continuing uncertainty over the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), illustrated by conflicting trial court rulings and scholarly commentaries, raises the question of why this constitutional question is so hard to answer. There are at least four reasons.NEJM:Rethinking Safety-Net Access for the UninsuredAccess programs for the uninsured usually serve people with household incomes below about twice the federal poverty level. They may therefore be hard pressed to adapt their missions to the new uninsured population in ways that will maintain their fragile support from funders and volunteers. Since safety-net systems are already on life support,1 any major shock may threaten their very existence. Therefore, access programs must consider carefully how best to refocus and justify their function and mission.In that light, from theWaPo:The new year will bring important changes to U.S. health-insurance rules, as new provisions related to last years massive health-care overhaul take effect.The new rules are designed to help those caught in Medicares doughnut hole, offer seniors more preventative care, and limit how much of their customers money health-insurance companies can keep for overhead and profit.They all go into effect on Saturday.Complainhere.Ezra Klein:Isolate the eight key economic decisions of the Obama presidency: The intervention in the financial sector, the intervention in the auto sector, the intervention in the housing sector, the stimulus package, the health-care bill, financial regulation, and the tax deal. The financial and auto interventions, it should be noted, were begun under George W. Bush but carried out and expanded under Obama.In each case, the Obama administration sought to support or improve private markets. It refused to leave the market to sort itself out, as some on the right would have preferred, and resisted entreaties to take it over, as some on the left advocated.WaPo:Nearly all of them, like Bell, had stumbled into the tea party after Barack Obamas election. Theyd found a calling in the early days of a chaotic, leaderless movement that beckoned to political novices who identified themselves as conservatives but felt little attachment to organized politics. With astonishing speed, the tea party evolved into a powerful force that helped overturn the political order in Washington.But as a new cast of lawmakers takes the reins in the Capitol, Bell and many of her fellow tea partiers across the country are feeling adrift, wondering what they are supposed to do next. The movement is changing, in their view, and not necessarily for the better.Gail Collins has a multiple choice test for you:IV.

The companies must either spend this money to pay insurance claims or use it for activities that improve customers health.For policies that are sold to large groups instead of small companies and individuals, the number is even higher: 85 percent.
