This hub will try and demystify the subject, with the help of easy-to-understand examples.  And if you want to ask any questions or make suggestions on how to improve/add to the information I've given, you're more than welcome to do so via the comments section at the bottom of the page!Equivalent ratio or splitting ratio?Sometimes its hard to work out what you need to do when confronted with a problem involving ratio.  Hopefully the following two examples will help clarify.Example 1To make Elephant Grey paint, you needto mix Snow White and Ebony Black together in a ratio of 3:2. How muchSnow White will you need if youre using 4 litres of Ebony Black?Example 2To make Elephant Grey paint, you need to mix Snow White and Ebony Black together in a ratio of 3:2.  How much Snow White will you need if you want to make 10 litres of Elephant Grey?Example 1 is an equivalent ratio question, where each quantity ismultiplied by the same number to bulk out the quantities.  The 2 (thenumber of parts Ebony Black) is multiplied by 2 to make 4 litres, whichmeans that the 3 (the number of parts Snow White) also has to bemultiplied by 2 to make 6 litres.  You can draw it like the picture to the right, in a sort of flow chart:In Example 2, you have a different sort of problem.  You only know how much of the mixed finished product you are going to end up with, not how much of either colour.  You therefore need to split the finished product into 3 parts of Snow White and 2 parts of Ebony Black (hence the term splitting ratio to describe this sort of problem).You have 3 parts of Snow White and 2 parts of Ebony Black, which gives a total of 5 parts (3 + 2 = 5).Ten litres of Elephant Grey divided by 5 gives 2. Therefore each part of paint is 2 litres.Three parts of Snow White = 3 x 2 = 6 litresTwo parts of Ebony Black = 2 x 2 = 4 litres.For US readersKiss My Math: Showing Pre-Algebra Who's BossAmazon Price: $6.99List Price: $15.00Pythagoras and the Ratios: A Math AdventureAmazon Price: $4.26List Price: $7.95If Dogs Were DinosaursAmazon Price: $9.89List Price: $16.99Painless Math Word Problems (Barron's Painless Series)Amazon Price: $0.28List Price: $8.95For when you have to work back the other waySometimes you're just given some raw numbers and have to work out the ratio from that.  For example, suppose you work in a company with a total of 450 employees.  The number of men is 270.  What is the ratio of women to men?Firstly you find the number of women, which is a straightforward question of subtraction, i.e. 450 - 270 = 180The ratio of women to men can be written as 180:270.  (Side note: if you were talking about the ratio of men to women, you'd write it the other way round, i.e. 270:180.)The ratio 180:270 can be cancelled down to a simpler form.  This is EXACTLY like cancelling fractions.  So in this instance it's possible to cancel, by dividing by ten and then by 9, i.e.                180:270           =           18:27         =           2:3Thus the ratio of women to men in the company is 2:3 in its simplest form.

Wilson12 months ago Nice useful information!EmpressFelicity12 months ago Thank you!  And, er, Merry Christmas.William R. Wilson12 months ago Oh yeah.  You too.  xD.matt7 months ago Hey can you help, please?there are sweets in a bag.-12 are toffees-18 are mintswrite down the ratio of mints to toffee in its simplest.what that be #18-12 for the frist section then 18/6 then 12/6 which is 3:2? im confused is this right?EmpressFelicity7 months ago Hi Matt, you are right about the first stage - the ratio of mints to toffee would be 18:12.  But it went a bit wrong after that - there's no way that cancelling (aka reducing) 18:12 would give 12:6.  If you divide both the 18 and the 12 by 3, you would get 6:4, which then cancels down to 3:2.  Or you could just go via a more direct route and divide both the 18 and the 12 by 6 - this would get you straight to 3:2.  Hope that helps.james7 months ago cheers d-headIan7 months ago Ok, i had a ratio at work to figure out. can you help?i need to blend 8kg of bread crumbs and 1.6kg of pasley total weight 9.6kg. what is the ratio of that. (how do u work that out)The ratio for pasley is to high to blend with breadcrumbs. so i need to make the ratio of 8:1 so how much more bread crumbs do i need to bring it to that ratio. how to work that out on the calculator?EmpressFelicity7 months ago Hello Ian.  To find the ratio of parsley to breadcrumbs on a calculator, just divide 8 by 1.6.  (It should come to 5, which means you have a ratio of 5:1.)  If you don't have a calculator, you can still do it, by playing around with the numbers until it's possible to cancel them.So, starting with 8:1.6Multiplying both sides by ten gives 80:16Then you can start cancelling.  For example, you can divide both sides by 8, which gives10:2And then by 2, giving 5:1There are other ways to cancel down to get this answer - for example, you can just keep dividing the 80 and the 16 by 2, which will get you there eventually!For the last bit, just multiply the weight of parsley (1.6 kg, which is the "1" in the 8:1 ratio) by 8.Ian7 months ago Cheers.Oh i get it know. some playing around with the calculator. Thanks.simple maths Really. just can be confusing get muddled up with numbersbonnie6 months ago Dani and Kylie have a 5:2 ration in a business worth $1,500,000. find the value of danis share in the business?helpEmpressFelicity6 months ago Hi Bonnie, this is a classic "splitting ratio" type of question.  Dani has five parts of the business and Kylie has two, making seven parts in all.  Divide the $1.5M by 7 to find out what each part is worth, and go from there.ss sneh6 months ago Hi! Awesome! NOT this hub but the reactions to this hub!* Useful (3)* Awesome (2)* Beautiful (1)I am just wondering the IQ level of people who commented "Awesome" to this hub!  -- Thanks??5 months ago in a office the ratio of staff who supported footy to those who supported soccer was 5:2 If 21 staff gave there opinions who many supported soccer? i know the answer but dont know how to work it outEmpressFelicity5 months ago Hello, "??" (sure that's not your real name LOL).  I won't tell you the answer, but I'll give you a clue: it's a "splitting ratio" type of problem, i.e. the 21 staff covers both the 5 parts who supported football and the 2 parts who supported soccer.  In other words, there are 7 parts altogether, covering 21 people.mathslover5 months ago Very useful information!Rea5 months ago A 720 ml container holds a mixture of red, yellow, and white paint in a 5 : 3 : 12 ratio. How much more red paint than yellow is present in the mixture?EmpressFelicity5 months ago Hi Rea, thanks for your question.  You add the 5, the 3 and the 12 to find out how many "parts" of paint there are overall (20 parts), and then work out what amount of paint each part corresponds to (hint: 20 parts - 720 ml).  From there on, you work out the volume of red paint and the volume of yellow paint.  Then subtract one from the other to get your answer.  Hope that helps.Christine5 months ago Hi im abit stuck on a paper and have been going over and over ratio's and still cant work them out can you please help meyour the responsibilitie as a school caretaker include keeping the school free of graffiti. You have a special paint that you can put on buildings of fences that stops other paint sticking to it. This formula is 9 litres of repellent to 150 litres of paint.What is the ratio of repellent to paint?i keep coming up with 3:50 cause you cant take 9 into 150 or can you?Ellen5 months ago how they can best achieve a high rate lambing rate from their ewes (female sheep). you have advised your client that a ratio of 1:40 rams (male sheep) to ewes is necessary. your client  has 3360 ewes.how much rams are needed for this number of sheep?EmpressFelicity5 months ago Hi Christine and Ellen, thanks for reading this hub!Christine, you're absolutely right - if you want to use whole numbers in your answer, then 3:50 is as far as you can go, because you can't divide the numbers any further (3 doesn't go into 50 without leaving a remainder).  Although having said that, it's also possible to use decimals in a ratio - you can also express this particular ratio as 1:16.67 (to two decimal places).As this hub has generated so many questions, what I think I'll do is write a second hub with some more worked examples and a few problems that people can solve!  (Followed shortly by a third hub with answers to the problems in the second.)

How long in hours and minutes did Vreni take to walk the 2o kilometres??-Help please.EmpressFelicity4 months ago Hi there, Silentsss.  Your question isn't about ratio but I'll have a go at answering it anyway - however, you'll need to tell me the length of the bit of road she walked on and the length of the footpath.  (I know the two together add up to 20 km, but that alone isn't enough information for me.)jock4 months ago im completly confused can u help me?????EmpressFelicity4 months ago Hi Jock, tell me what you're confused about and I'll do my best LOL.Ruth-Margaret Dailey4 months ago glad to find this.

Work out the champion's prize money in 2008.......susan 3 months ago three boys shared 48 in the ratio 5:4:3Daniel received the smallest amounthow much did Daniel recieve?EmpressFelicity3 months ago @Amrita"Josie makes fruit punch by mixing fruit juice and lemonade in the ratio 3:4. She needs to make 56 litres of punch.  How much of each ingredient does she need?"There are 3 parts of fruit juice and 4 parts lemonade, making 7 parts.  You know that the 7 parts corresponds to 56 litres, so what does one part correspond to?  Once you know that, you can multiply this out to find out the actual amount of each ingredient.7 parts = 56 litres, therefore 1 part = 8 litres (56 divided by 7).Amount of fruit juice = 3 x 8 = 24 litresAmount of lemonade = 4 x 8 = 32 litres."During the party Josie decides to make some more. She has 9 litres of fruit juice left and plenty of lemonade. How much extra punch can she make?"9 litres = 3 parts.  Therefore 1 part = 3 litres.Because there would be 4 parts of lemonade, the amount of lemonade she'd need would be 3 x 4 = 12 litres.EmpressFelicity3 months ago @ Kate"In 2009 the wimbledon ladies singles champion won 850,000. The ratio for 2008 to 2009 is 15:17. Work out the champion's prize money in 2008."Rephrase the question by saying "If 850,000 = 17 parts, then what does 15 parts correspond to?"Then work out what one part is worth, and multiply by 15.One part = 850,000 divided by 17, which is 50,000.15 parts = 50,000 x 15 = 750,000.  So that's what the champion won in 2008.EmpressFelicity3 months ago @ Susan"three boys shared 48 in the ratio 5:4:3.  Daniel received the smallest amount.  how much did Daniel recieve?"Again, this is another one where you add up all the parts and find out what one part is worth.  5+4+3 = 12 parts.  One part is therefore 48 divided by 12, i.e. 4.  Daniel gets three parts, so he gets 4 x 3 = 12.Anyone else wants to ask a question, I STRONGLY recommend you try the problems in my follow-up hub (link at the bottom of this actual hub, above the comments section).  Hopefully by then you'll be a lot more comfortable with this subject and won't need my help any more!Andy2 months ago Hi,I have some red balls and some blue balls in a bag with a ratio of 4:7.I add 10 more red balls and end up with a ratio of 6:7.How many blue balls do I have?Many thanks.Richard Meggie2 months ago Thank you so much for your shedding light on my knowledge in this arena. just going through it was truly an inspiration.

How much lemon juice is there in 2 Litres of lemonade?EmpressFelicity2 months ago @Andy: "I have some red balls and some blue balls in a bag with a ratio of 4:7.  I add 10 more red balls and end up with a ratio of 6:7.  How many blue balls do I have?"You might be forgiven for thinking that this one involves algebra, but actually it doesn't.The ten extra red balls that you add correspond to two "parts" (since 6 - 4 = 2).  Therefore one part = 5.If you have 4 parts red balls and 7 parts blue balls to begin with, then you have 20 red balls and 35 blue balls.  (4 x 5 = 20, and 7 x 5 = 35).EmpressFelicity2 months ago @Louie: "The ratio of men to women on a train was 5:8. there were 200 men, how many women on the train?"There are 5 parts men and 8 parts women.  5 parts = 200, therefore 1 part = 200/5 = 40.  8 parts = 40 x 8 = 320.  so there are 320 women on the train.EmpressFelicity2 months ago @Vanita"What is the approximate ratio to the number of telephones in india to the number of telephones in the uk?

Say, 30 million and 8 million.Approximate ratio of phones in India to phones in the UK is therefore8 million : 30 millionor just 8 : 30, which cancels down to 4 : 15.  Out of the above options, I'd say the nearest one is 2 : 7 (since if you double both the 2 and the 7 you get 4 : 14, which isn't too far off).EmpressFelicity2 months ago @Tom:"Hi, can you help,I have my GCSE's (maths) coming up in about a week and a half and was wondering if you could put or put a link for a easy-hard set of questions to do with ratios please.  thanksss =]"Go to my profile page (just click the name "Empress Felicity" anywhere it appears as a link), and you'll find links to all my maths hubs, including a few hubs that give you some ratio and scale problems to try.

How much money has Steve got?You therefore need to split the finished product into 3 parts of Steve and 2 parts of Jane (hence the term splitting ratio to describe this sort of problem).You have 3 parts of Steve and 2 parts of Jane, which gives a total of 5 parts (3 + 2 = 5).140 of Elephant Grey divided by 5 gives 28. Therefore each part of paint is 28 litres.Three parts of Steve = 3 x 28 = 84 litresTwo parts of Jane = 2 x 28 = 56 litres.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sitesSome of EmpressFelicity's other maths hubsMillion billion trillion - making sense of large numbersSome hints and tricks on dealing with large numbers, including calculations involving them! - 11 months agoHow to calculate ratio part III: answers to problems in part IIThe answers to the ratio and proportion problems in part II. - 5 months agoWorking out percentages - a basic guide, including some simple shortcutsA quick guide to working out percentages, including some handy shortcuts - 13 months agoHow to calculate ratio part IV: scale drawings and mapsA guide to solving ratio and proportion problems involving scale.
