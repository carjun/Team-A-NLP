T-Paw wants the rubes to believe  he would reinstate don't ask don't tell. * Which prompts Adam Serwer to  marvel at the degree to which "homophobia" remains "a litmus test for the Republican presidential nomination."* TPM digs deeper and  finds that the whole tale of John Boehner supposedly snubbing Obama is much ado about nothing, another reminder that left-leaning outlets are often willing to stick to the facts even when they go off the script dictated by almighty Soros.* Matthew Cooper asks: Was Palin's "blood libel" reference all about  sending a signal to her deeply pro-Israel evangelical Christian supporters?* Digby  says "blood libel" may have alienated elites, but solidified Palin's role as leader of "aggrieved Americans who cannot accept the legitimacy of their political opposition." * The Palin damage control tour continues with a  planned interview with Fox News. Talk about stepping out of the bubble!* Steve Benen  skewers James Taranto's effort to get Michele Bachmann off the hook for her "armed and dangerous" comment.* Jed Lewison offers a qualified endorsement of the bipartisan SOTU seating idea, but adds the crucial point that the  best way to get Congress working together is to remove incentives for obstruction, via filibuster reform.* Gallup  finds most don't think incendiary rhetoric played a "major" role in the killings, but 42 percent think it played a major or minor role, versus 42 percent who say it didn't.* Andrew Sullivan offers a  compelling reason why you should you can chip money to support Glenn Greenwald's blog, which you can do  right here.* And despite what you may have heard, Gabrielle Giffords's doctors have  confirmed that she did in fact open her eyes spontaneously for the first time.What else is happening?201101131802ByGreg Sargent|January 13, 2011;  6:02 PM ETCategories:Happy Hour Roundup, House Dems, Senate Dems, filibusterSave & Share:Previous: Palin, 'blood libel' and the old epistemic closure discussionNext: The Morning PlumCommentsIt was the best of times it was the worst of times, I love TolstoyPosted by: shrink2 | January 13, 2011  6:08 PM | Report abuseOh, good.

And it is a prime electoral strategy to attempt to neuter or denigrate whatever an opposing candidate might come to represent positively in the minds of voters.  If the candidate represents X and the citizens agree that X is a good, then try to show that the candidate doesn't really have X at all.   If the candidate is perceived as "honest", then find ways to make him look dishonest.  Etc.Here's Rove today in the WSJ..."Mr. Obama's best chance of success 22 months from now rests on reclaiming his image as a reasonable, bipartisan and unifying figure."http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704803604576077813329940804.htmlPosted by: bernielatham | January 13, 2011  6:19 PM | Report abuseT-paw is a fool.

Posted by: shrink2 | January 13, 2011  6:21 PM | Report abuseAn argument for keeping the partisan seating at the SOTU:"Unity is great, sure, but apart from the entertainment value, there is an important practical reason to maintain the State of the Union's partisan seating arrangement. A neat separation of the parties allows the American people to see, in real time, their positions on the president's agenda and the issues of the day. It's actually very informative and helpful to be able to easily assess which proposals the Republicans and Democrats support, respectively, through the decision to applaud. It also allows us to identify the few party-bucking independent thinkers who, every so often, stand up to clap while the rest of their colleagues remain seated.Thrown together in one big bipartisan hodgepodge, congressmen and senators would still carefully regulate their applause, but that brief chamber reaction shot on TV becomes nearly impossible to decipher. The country could certainly benefit from more symbolic demonstrations of solidarity, but the State of the Union address is one instance where a stark partisan divide is actually good for democracy."http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/01/colorado_senator_mark_udall_wa.htmlPosted by: suekzoo1 | January 13, 2011  6:21 PM | Report abuseps... obviously, that establishes a key element in the PR/propaganda blueprint over the next two years.

I have been rather flummoxed by why that term was inserted in Palin's PR thingey.  But, first of all, I have no thought that Palin herself wrote the speech.  I also doubt very much she was terribly familiar with the term if familiar with it at all.

I posted a link the other day to an audio of the entire interview. It's not hard to find. The outrageous call to harms is between 11 and 12 minutes.It's a litmus test of intellectual honesty, because it isn't possible to listen and interpret as anything other than a metaphor for being informed.

He said that Louis Farrakhan "epitomizes greatness."He said that he went to Libya in 1984 with Louis Farrakhan to visit with Moammar Gadhafi and that, when your political opponents found out about that, quote, "your Jewish support would dry up quicker than a snowball in Hell.""On Sunday, the headline in your hometown paper, Chicago Tribune: "Louis Farrakhan Backs Obama for President at Nation of Islam Convention in Chicago." ======================================="The Jews don't like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that's a good name. Hitler was a very great man." Louis Farrakhan "Anarchy may await America, due to the daily injustices suffered by the people."

But here is the problem.  It's not just the pols...no matter what you may think of Bachmann or Palin they look like Ms Manners compared to the filthy hog on the radio.  He makes his money by appealing to those like Brigade who actually enjoy wallowing in hate and insulting as many people as he can on this blog.  Wait for it and we'll see what kind of insult I can dig up from the humorless one.  Kevin I'm getting you troll hunter this weekend.  Reading some of these folks who think they are funny is like listening to that tone deaf relative play piano.  In addition to the sorrow of realizing there are such hate filled insult spewing folks on this earth..at the end of the day these folks like Brigade, RFR Kaddeffi and the other bitter burned out haters worst offense may simply be they are BORING!Because of that audience of haters and other bitter folks, Rushbo, Beck, Hannity et al earn a great living.   Imagine what would happen to them if we take their golden goose away from them.For me this is the confirmation of Oscar Wilde's famous observation..."Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life".How many of you remember the incredible classic...the 1976 Oscar winner...the talented Paddy Chayefsky's prescient classic "Network"It's so close to what's happening it's almost eerie...do you remember the film?Fox News er United Broadcasting system has an anchor Glen Beck...er Howard Beale who is given two weeks notice and goes on the air and says he will commit suicide on the air on his final broadcast.  Can't imagine Beck with that much flair for the dramatic?Really?Of course the company pulls the anchor for obvious reasons.  Beale's good friend Sean Hannity...er Max Schumacher persuades the Network to give Beck oops Beale one last show to say farewell to his audience. Fox er UBS lets him back on the air, ostensibly for a dignified farewell. Beck/Beale promises he will apologize for his outburst. However, once on the air, he launches into a rant claiming that life is "bullshit". Beck/Beale's outburst causes the newscast's ratings to soar.  Much to Schumacher's dismay, the upper echelons of UBS, Roger Ailes, decide to exploit Beale's antics rather than pulling him off the air. In one impassioned diatribe, Beale galvanizes the nation with his rant, "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!" and persuades Americans to shout out their windows during a lightning storm. Soon Beck/Beale is hosting a new program called "The Glen Beck/Howard Beale Show", top-billed as a "mad prophet." Ultimately, the show becomes the highest rated program on television, and Beck/Beale finds new celebrity preaching his angry message in front of a live studio audience(Brigade/Kde/RFR/Skip) that, on cue, chants Becks/Beale's signature catchphrase en masse: "We're as mad as hell, and we're not going to take this anymore."Posted by: rukidding7 | January 13, 2011  7:51 PM | Report abuseI imagine that when Sarah Palin released her video yesterday morning, a siren went off in the Washington Post newsroom with employees running around bumping into each other, papers flying in the air and Columnists scurrying to their desks to write the 74 Sarah Palin articles that have appeared in the Post the last two days.Seriously, there have been more articles about Sarah Palin in the Post the last two days than about Jared Loughner.I understand a newspaper needs to make a buck but this is ridiculous.Posted by: Bcjbs1 | January 13, 2011  7:54 PM | Report abuseI imagine that when Sarah Palin released her video yesterday morning, a siren went off in the Washington Post newsroom with employees running around bumping into each other, papers flying in the air and Columnists scurrying to their desks to write the 74 Sarah Palin articles that have appeared in the Post the last two days.Seriously, there have been more articles about Sarah Palin in the Post the last two days than about Jared Loughner.I understand a newspaper needs to make a buck but this is ridiculous.Posted by: Bcjbs1 | January 13, 2011  7:54 PM | Report abuse"Btw as a Chinese, I don't even know..."So this is how the right makes their case?Louis Farrakhan, ignorant Chinese...Do you have a message?

Obviously agrees with you as that is exactly how he refers to Beck.I guess I'm a bit prejudiced because Peter Finch gave such a great performance as Beck..I mean Beale.

You get caught with your hand in the cookie jar and so you let on that "Billy took one too!"   That could be true or a lie but the motive is the same.  You don't want to be singled out for bad stuff.In the political sphere, we have an example of how this works with electoral fraud claims.  There's been a long-running campaign to have people believe that elections have been corrupted by people voting more than once or by people voting who are ineligible to legally vote.  A raft of investigations have found nearly zero evidence that this has actually happened.But it provides equivalence cover for the real corruption for which a lot of people have actually gone to jail - keeping people from voting at all.Obviously, the present provides an even more clear example and it is strategic.  Note that this can be done in a pre-emptive or predictive manner (I am going to do this bad thing and might get caught so I'll spread it around that the other side has been doing it).  As Jay Rosen put it in a tweet..."Does this thing have a name?  "Watch: To sow confusion and stoke rage, I'll accuse those people there of exactly what I am doing right now."OK, so the Palin camp (apparently) contacted ABC and told them that Palin had been receiving death threats at unprecedented levels.  Then US News and World picked it up.Bad, of course, if real but the Palin camp provided and still provides no evidence that this is true.http://www.thenation.com/blog/157732/sarah-palins-death-threat-claimsSo we'll have to see if any evidence is provided that this is true.  If such evidence isn't provided, you'll have a fine example of how the equivalence trick is used as a propaganda tool.Posted by: bernielatham | January 13, 2011  8:29 PM | Report abuse"Looks like the quotes from Obama's buddies really got to you."Yes -- their influence on public policy these last couple of years is direct and obvious..Posted by: jprestonian | January 13, 2011  8:30 PM | Report abuseSince we're on movie motif tonight...here's one for the current Governor of my State..Rick Scott....from All About Eve and Betty Davis....""Hang on it's going to be a bumpy ride"Yesterday a staunchly conservative R Florida State Senate told the Medicare Fraudster to forget about tax cuts with a 4 billion $ deficit to deal with already.Today it gets even better...Fraudster Scott's Cabinet while all conservative R's are elected to their offices not appointed and can tell the Guv to kiss their backsides...which is pretty much what they did today.http://www.tampabay.com/news/aging/nursinghomes/cabinet-to-rick-scott-no-you-cant-veto-our-regulations/1145391TALLAHASSEE  Thirty minutes after taking office last week, Gov.

Because they sure are not recovering with this liberal agenda and collection of mis-fit interest groups.The democrats are finished.   Even worse, they have lost all credibility with the American People -When a democrat makes a campaign pledge, after Obama there is NO REASON to believe that person....    ALL the democrats do is LIE TO GET SOME CENTRIST VOTES, AND THEY ARE GOING TO SWING TO THE FAR LEFT.The democrats can NOT be trusted.I predict the democrats will fall to gerrymandered districts and hand-full of blue States - all of which are in horrible financial condition.    A new party will emerge in its place.

I especially work hard to try and respect their opinions even when disagreeing with them.  I used to try Politico and redstate to see what conservative thought was taking place, but it was just too much talking points and snark and never real discussion.  I enjoy snark as much as the next guy, as long as it's clever, not banal (nothing like wearing out a new favorite word eh)or too mean spirited.  Anyway the beauty of having all of our conservative friends here is that while there is certainly enough snark there are also plenty of really neat policy discussion.  I feel like here conservatives who stick around eventually get seduced into a rational..dare I say it.civil conversatio. I can get a better picture of what you righties believe at any given moment.If it wasn't for PL I might believe all those nasty stereotypes promulgated by MSNBC and HuffPo.  :-)  Here I get to see some "genuine" conservative out of talking point mode...well some of you anyway.As for meanness I can see you and Liam enjoy playing a game very close to the African American game called "The Dozens" and in fact Liam even engaged in that very game when he brought up "yo mama".I guess my weakness Brigade is that I'm not a great multitasker when it comes to jumping quickly from serious political discussion to the "dozens" and back again..especially since between the serious discussion and the "fun" you and Liam enjoy are folks here who are quite serious about hating we on the left.

Officials high and low, famous and obscure. From the Obamas on down.Bernie knows that these threats are fomented by right-wing rhetoric and rise and fall with it. He scoffs at doubters of his wisdom on this.But Sarah Palin, that's another matter. True, she's a very prominent political figure and without a doubt the most vilified one in the land. Bernie's team has just this past week been on her like pack of wild dogs accusing her of personally inciting mass murder and bringing the entire country to the eve of self destruction. Probably 100 time more people have been deluged in attacks on Palin than had ever heard of Gabby Giffords before Saturday.The internet is chock full of fantasies, wishes and threats to Palin. There are Facebook pages dedicated to wishing she were killed. But when it comes to Palin, why, Bernie just doesn't buy it. Palin, that dimwit who can't even think for herself must be inventing threats to distract from . . . from what? All the threats she is making?

Who profits?"Political violence in America always has been a matter of great convenience to the people who actually own the country. They don't have to inspire it, or finance it. They can even deplore it. All they really have to do is control the reaction to it  not let it get so wild that it disturbs the stock market and, at the same time, not let the reality of political violence disrupt the anesthetic consensus that swaddles the centers of real power. Thus do we get lone gunmen, and ritualized "healing," and infinite misdirection. Earnest cud-chewing about talk-radio. David Gergen wonders about violence on TV and David Frum talks about marijuana, but nobody asks the old Latin question: Cui bono? Who profits?There is even a reluctance in the prim and proper precincts of the elite corporate press to call what happened to Gabrielle Giffords an assassination attempt, and to call what Jared Loughner did a political act, because it is not nice to admit how thoroughly ingrained violence has become in our amnesiac American politics, because then we might ask who profits from walking on the fringe...."http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/political-violence-in-america-4834173#ixzz1Ave66RTA"Bernie, did you think this editorial was intelligent?

It's a rationalization as to why "do as I say, not as I do" is a legitimate philosophical choice. I've come to treat the charge of false equivalence as the equal (see what I'm doing here?) of saying: 'It's okay when our side does it, because we're the good guys". Of course people on the left and right get death threats, and the more prominent they are, the more often they get them. There were folks who kept champaign in the fridge for the day they heard Reagan was dead. And, when he died, they popped the cork.

Seniors are not faring all that well during this recession and the idea that we are even considering cut to Social Security needs to be revisited with these new poverty numbers.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"Less than ten percent of the nation's 38 million elderly people are living in poverty, according to the official statistics. But once medical care and other costs of living are factored in, the number of people 65 and older living in poverty jumps to 16.1 percent, according to a new Census Bureau analysis.The new numbers have been a long time coming. The official poverty rate has been calculated the same way -- based primarily on the cost of food -- for decades, while life has become more expensive. In 1995, the National Academy of Sciences released a report (PDF) calling for changes in the accounting of poverty. Those recommendations are largely reflected in the new Census numbers. The Census will continue to report poverty numbers using the old formula for the sake of comparison, but will also report the more comprehensive figure.Overall poverty using the new methodology is only slightly higher. The official poverty rate for all groups rose in 2009 to 14.3 percent from 13.2 percent the previous year, reflecting not only the impact of the recession, but also the expanded safety net that came from the stimulus bill, which prevented the number from rising as much as economists expected. Under the alternative measure, poverty would have been 15.7 percent in 2009.Among the elderly, the new method of calculation had the biggest effect. Even with Medicare's prescription drug coverage, seniors are still responsible for some copays and fees, which can add up for a person living on a fixed income. For the past two years, Social Security beneficiaries have been denied a cost-of-living increase.The new elderly poverty stats come as politicians wrestle with cutting Social Security benefits in the name of reducing the budget deficit -- though the program is funded separately by payroll taxes and does not contribute to the debt.What the numbers show is that rather than Social Security benefits being too generous, they are too meager to keep one in six old folks out of poverty."http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/13/elderly-poverty-rate-census_n_808797.htmlPosted by: lmsinca | January 13, 2011 10:53 PM | Report abuseUnhinged people can make threats against any well known person.

Each year she would spent her last remaining money to light candles in front of the Statue of The Virgin Mary,and pray for a good crop yield.One year the rains rotted all the crops, and the single mother of several children, turned bitter, because she had bought the candles, and the Virgin Mary had let her down.So, she knelt in front of the Statue and said: I do not believe you are really a Virgin.

This is an effort yet again to spare the banks any pain, not only at the cost of the rule of law but also of investor rights.This proposal guts state control of their own real estate law when the Supreme Court has repeatedly found that dirt law is not a Federal matter. It strips homeowners of their right to their day in court to preserve their contractual rights, namely, that only the proven mortgagee, and not a gangster, or in this case, bankster, can take possession of their home.This sort of protection is fundamental to the operation of capitalism, so its astonishing to see neoliberals so willing to throw it under the bus to preserve the balance sheets of the TBTF banks. Readers may recall how we came to have this sort of legal protection in the first place. England learned the hard way in the 17th century what happens with low documentation requirements: abuse of court procedures, perjury and corruption become the norm. Parliament enacted the 1677 Statute of Fraudsto establish higher standards for contracts, such as witnessing by a third party, to stop the widespread theft of property that was underway.The memo completely ignores the harm to investors from the bank mistakes and lacks any provisions for damage to investors to be remedied. Moreover, denying borrower rights removes their leverage to obtain deep principal mortgage modifications, which for viable borrowers produces lower losses than costly foreclosures and sales of distressed property. Thus this shredding of contractual protections in mortgages not only hurts borrowers but also harms investors."http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/01/dc-puts-its-bankster-friendly-solution-for-foreclosure-fraud-on-the-table.htmlPosted by: lmsinca | January 13, 2011 11:55 PM | Report abuseBut I confess I have never begun the discussion by denigrating them as "prayer-pushers".Any chance you might answer my questions?Posted by: ScottC3 | January 13, 2011 11:33 PM ...................Elementary my dear Watson,When some one reposts my posting of a news report, that lays out the improving condition of Congresswoman Giffords, and they then add on to it, their own claim: "prayer works", as their way of claiming that is actually why the Congresswoman is improving.No matter how you slice it, they decided to push the prayer claim, which in turn makes them prayer pushers.Of course the could just as easily have claimed that putting a frog under a milk pail is what has brought about the improvement.

We're not.On one side we have people who see a moral imperative in government's role in minimizing suffering and equalizing opportunity; on the other we have the angry conviction that taxation and regulation toward that goal are tyranny on the level of concentration camps.  Taking money from people who have earned it and giving it to others, however desperate their need, is a greater immorality than letting them starve to death.Sorry Greg but I don't want to be reconciled with people like that.  I want them to lose, I want their morality condemned in the most unequivocal terms.A few days ago just after Giffords' shooting there were calls from a few of the PL conservatives, or one of them anyway, to put aside rancor and hope for her recovery.

They don't feel it, they don't believe anyone else does either, it's always a pretense.The division isn't just ideological, it's moral, it's fundamental.

Rush Limbaugh has said almost the exact same thing--he wants liberals to lose. Says there's no room for reconciliation. Etc. Whether or not there is room for compromise in a completely neutral sense is irrelevant (although, of course, there is). There are plenty of people on both sides who have no interest in it, and for whom taking a political scorched earth policy is a moral imperative. There's no truce.Of course, there's not ever going to be a decisive defeat or victory for either side, either. The goal posts will move, back and forth, back and forth. :)That being said, Cao, I can get Troll Hunter to run on iCab. There is a caveat: having it autorun doesn't seem to work. I'm testing it on a 1st generation iPhone, an iPad may not have this problem, but I think it's probably inherent in how iCab handles modules.So, on any page you'd want Troll Hunter to run, you'd have to click on the puzzle piece and tap the Troll Hunter module and then wait for it to run. Then, you see someone you want to ignore. You press the ignore button, wait for the page to load, then you have to tap the Troll Hunter to run again, and then it will execute your ignore command.It's more manual labor intensive than I'd like, but it does work. I may try and contact them about how their modules work to see if there is a reliable way to have the script execute only after the page is entirely loaded, but not execute repeatedly (my two options right now, it appears).

With the 2010 midterms, the biggest players have been on the Republican side.Such nonprofit advocacy groups are permitted by the I.R.S. to engage in political activity, so long as it is not their primary purpose. They are allowed to do an unlimited amount of lobbying on issues related to their core purpose. Stopping short of what would clearly be considered express advocacy in most of their ads enables them to better make the case to the I.R.S. they are merely doing issue advocacy. It is often hard, however, for the casual observer to tell the difference between the issue advocacy and express advocacy.As long as most of a groups advertisements are not explicit calls to vote for or against candidates, the Republican election commissioners are likely to leave them alone, ruling their major purpose is not political, campaign finance lawyers said.

The decisive moment came when the left was loudly demanding that he fight to the last ditch for repeal of the Bush tax cuts for the rich, even if it meant the lame-duck session of Congress ended in a dead-duck session. Instead, recognizing Sen. Mitch McConnells Republicans not only had the votes but the will to block any action in the Senate before the GOP took over the House in January, Obama shoved aside Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and moved to cut a deal with the GOP.The Republicans got the Bush tax cuts. But Obama got a Social Security payroll tax cut for every worker, an estate tax raised back to 35 percent and another full year of unemployment compensation. Obama had entered negotiations with a weak hand. But he had emerged with so impressive a deal from his own partys standpoint that Republican deficit hawks wanted their party to walk away from it, even if it meant all the Bush tax cuts expired on Jan. 1. After cutting that deal and breaking the logjam, Obama got votes and victories on allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military and on providing billions for the first responders of 9/11. He came close to getting a limited amnesty for illegal aliens.In short, by shouldering Pelosi and Reid aside and taking charge of negotiations with the Republicans himself, Obama not only won a string of victories, he proved bipartisan government could work. Since then, he has been on a steady ascent in the polls. And, in his choice of new aides like Chicagos William Daley, brother of the mayor and son of the legend, Obama has signaled that after an era of confrontation on Capitol Hill comes an era of negotiation.What does this mean for Democrats?The left wing of the party, for the immediate future, is going to be the dummy at the bridge table. Obama is going to play every hand. For this president has been jolted into an awareness that, today, if not in 2008, this is a center-right country, and he and his party have drifted dangerously far out of the mainstream.

As a comic on John Stewart's show said, "Beck has Nazi-tourettes"Posted by: bernielatham | January 14, 2011  8:43 AM | Report abusewbg - I was thinking to myself how much easier it is to kill a bill than to pass one [I have done the former in the TX lege] that perhaps someone has done case studies of landmark bills over, say, the post WW2 period. Who lobbied for them, who lobbied against them, how was resistance to them overcome?  EXAMPLE:The tax reform of the 80s must have faced stiff opposition.  That effort cleaned up the Code quite a bit.  Of course, each lobby went to work on it immediately to muddy the waters.  IMHO, Tax Reform should be a ten year recurring item because the lobbies will have screwed up any cleaning in each decade.  But that effort in the 80s overcame widespread and powerful resistance, and if we are to try for it again today, along the lines of closing loopholes and simplifying brackets, we could learn from history, if someone has written the actual nuts and bolts of that struggle as a case study.Posted by: mark_in_austin | January 14, 2011  8:58 AM | Report abuse"Hey, does paraphrasing the messaging of Goebbels & Ribbentrop mean you have to put money in the Godwin jar?"It would just be deducted from my positive account balance.Posted by: quarterback1 | January 14, 2011  9:37 AM | Report abuseThere was some incoherent babble on huff post about Palin and weird apocalyptic Christian views of Israel.  It all gave her way too much credit for logical thinking but one fat shone through clear: she's connected with some REALLY nutty religious groups.Posted by: caothien9 | January 14, 2011  9:42 AM | Report abusebernielatham, there are differing opinions on "blood libel."

They didn't want to make it about themselves a la 56 interruptions of applause.  Did you ever watch how Speaker Hastert was treated at the Wellstone Memorial?RainForestRising, I suspect most of them know the import of Citizens United (Obama TAUGHT Con Law for goodness sake), but are simply lying about it for the rubes. ScottC3, I hope that Roberts and Alito stay away too. I doubt that Kagen and Sotomayor will.

It is a standard tactic of yours, of course.Posted by: ScottC3 | January 14, 2011 11:29 AM | Report abusePost a CommentWe encourage users to analyze, comment on and even challenge washingtonpost.com's  articles, blogs, reviews and multimedia features.
