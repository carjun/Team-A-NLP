Now something has changed. Congressional Democrats are challenging Republicans, daring them to come out against the bills more popular provisions. The Democratic National Committee is aggressively distributing talking points. According to an account in theNew York Times, Democrats will soon have a campaign-style war room for making their case. Its almost as if the the Democrats want this fight now.Of course, they may not have a choice. Republicans have made repeal a top priority, so the fight is going to take place whether or not Democrats want it. But I think it also reflects a changing dynamic, as well. According toGreg Sargent, who was among the first to spot the shift, House Democrats in particular are aware of the opportunity they missed last year, while the party and most of its leaders were trying so hard to save endangered incumbents. They think theyre in a stronger position now, since people are starting to see the laws benefits and repeal will mean changing an increasingly favorable status quo.It also helps that the Republicans finally have to do some governing. And governing requires the kind of specifics Republicans could avoid when they were merely campaigning to win office..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, UpdatesCongress, Democrats, House Democrats, Politics, President Obama, Republicans/GOP, The Democrats losing the House, White HouseRead moreLadies and Gentleman we have a Conservative Civil War at CPACJanuary 8, 2011jamesb1013 commentsThis from PoliticoResentment at Grover Norquist (left) and David Keene threatens to undermine CPAC.(AP Photos)A conservative civil war over CPACThe proximate cause of the explosion is the inclusion in CPAC of the combative gay conservative group GOProud. But if the sheer intensity of the quarrel seems disproportionate to that seemingly straightforward dispute, thats because its also deeply personal. Long-simmering resentment of two of the leading figures on the economic right, American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene  who runs the event  and Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, who has long been involved in planning it, has morphed into a conflict that carries the special bitterness of a civil war.There are a lot of conservatives who see a larger problem with Grover Norquist and David Keene, and theyve decided to fight it out and CPAC is a proxy for that, said Erick Erickson, the publisher of RedState.org, who said he wont be participating in the conference because he wants to stay out of the conflict. The underlying question is whether the conservative movement still has strong planks for social conservatism and national security conservatism. But it has also become very personal.If youve been around this town for a long time, as I have youve got people who disagree with you substantively and youve got people who dont like you and if you hang around long enough, their numbers increase, said Keene, who dismissed many of the attacks as residing in the fever swamps of the website WorldNetDaily.Its no secret that some social conservatives are very upset at the idea that there would be any participation by any organization thats gay, but over the course of the 37 or 38 years that CPACs been in existence weve had all kinds of people suggest that other people ought to be tossed out, he said. Our mission is once a year to allow social, economic, and national security conservatives to come together.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesConservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, David Keene, GOProud, Grover Norquist, Libertarian, Republicans/GOP, Social Conservatives, the 'Right'Read morePresident Obamas Approval 1/8/11..January 8, 2011jamesb1011 commentPresident Obamas Poll numbers..From Realclearpolitics.

At the Consumer Electronics Show, conference goers weighed in on the news.(WSJ)The move will for the first time let U.S. consumers choose the network that carries their iPhone and perhaps give them additional pricing options that could affect their monthly bills.It wasnt immediately clear when Verizon would have the device in stores.It will also upend the balance of power in the industry, ending Verizon rivalAT&T Inc.s exclusive hold on the device and leaving smaller players likeSprint Nextel Corp. and T-Mobile USA facing two well-capitalized competitors offering the worlds most popular smartphone.The Verizon phone will be similar to the iPhone 4 but run on the carriers CDMA technology, people familiar with the matter have said.Verizon Wireless is a joint venture betweenVerizon Communications Inc. andVodafone Group Plc.Apple is moving to expand its carrier base in the U.S. at a time when it is facing increasing pressure from phones powered by rivalGoogle Inc.s operating system, called Android.Google gives its software away, hoping to stake out space on mobile phones where it can sell ads and other services.Android-based phones passed the iPhone in sales in the second quarter, according to research firm GartnerRead more:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704739504576068170230339348.html#ixzz1ASctZdac*http://getclicky.com/marketshare/us/droid/Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Entertainment, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAndroid phone system vs iPhone, Apple Computer, AT&T, Verizon iPhone salesRead moreThe 15 Most Hated Companies in America..January 8, 2011jamesb101No commentsFrom The Atlantic magazine.Some of the results shouldnt surprise you. Many of the companies on this list are partially doomed by their industry. Airlines, cable companies, and banks for example, are often maligned by their customers. Retail firms and companies that were sensitive to downturns in the economy had to lay off significant numbers of employees during the recession, which bred resentment.But several companies you might have expected on this list arent. AIG became a pariah after its federal bailout, but it does not show up on the list thanks to high earnings over the past year, as its stock has nearly doubled. Goldman Sachs, that infamous vampire squid of Wall Street, earned a fair share of negative press and popular resentment since the credit crunch. But Goldman also ranked near the top in categories like customer satisfaction, shareholder satisfaction, employee satisfaction and CEO approval. GM has faced similar obstacles, but its also seen a spate of good news in the last few months, with profits, hires, and a successful IPO winning it more positive press coverage.More..Why am I not surprised that Bank of America tops the list?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAT&T, Bank of America, BP, Citibank, Dell, Direct TV, McDonalds, Nokia, The 15 Most Hated Companies in America, ToyotaRead moreThe US will offer Pakistan more military aid with the understanding that they have to step up against the TalibanJanuary 8, 2011jamesb1013 commentsAs the US/NATO effort intensifies against the strongholds of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The US is not pleased with the actions of the Pakistani military. With the countrys Intelligence service divided and helping both the US effort and seeking to work with and control part of the Taliban effort there is a problemThe US has been steadily pushing the Pakistani government for more action to take away its refuge for Taliban action s in Afghanistan ..The administration has decided to ramp up military aid to Pakistan in order for them to assume a more active role ..Vice President Biden will bring this message and ask for a wish list next week in a trip to the country..Several things come to this Dogs mind upon hearing this.I am not surprised by this action.Which reinforces my preaching that the US isnt leaving the region anytime soon.In fact as I have pointed out things are escalating in the war.While Pakistan has had to divert attention from the war to handle the recent floodsThe US/NATO effort presses on.Remember that $30 Billion Gates said was chopped of the war effort that I posted yesterday?Ill bet it ends up going to the Pakistani military.Either the whole thingOra good part of itNowhere is India mentioned in the linked Washington Post piece..Hummm?I dont suppose India is gonna be very happy with the US rearming Indias nuclear traditional adversary..Oh, yea Budget cuts and debt ceilings?You ARE joking right?Pakistan has complained in the past that promised U.S. aid, currently projected to total more than $3 billion in 2011, has been slow to arrive and that requests for helicopters and other military equipment have remained unfulfilled.Beginning with Bidens visit, the time may be ripe for a frank exchange of views and priorities between the two sides, another administration official said. The Pakistanis understand that Afghanistan-Pakistan has become the single most important foreign policy issue to the United States, and their cachet has gone up. But they also realize that they may have reached the point of maximum leverage, this official said, and things about their region are going to change one way or the other in the near future, as Congress and the American public grow increasingly disillusioned with the war and a timeline for military withdrawal is set.Something is going to give, he said. There is going to be an end-game scenario and theyre trying to guess where were heading.On intelligence, the administration plans to address Pakistans complaints that the Americans have not established enough outposts on the Afghan side of the border to stop insurgent infiltration, while pressing the Pakistanis to allow U.S. and Afghan officials to staff border coordination centers inside Pakistan itself.The intelligence coordination is part of an effort to build political, trade and security links between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a way of assuaging Pakistans fears thatIndia, its traditional adversary, is building its own influence in Afghanistan. We think theres a lot of room for improvement on that front, the senior official said..MoreObama and his senior staff have had to beat down numerous requests by in-theater military staff to take the war on to Pakistan itself in cross border raids.. I would NOT be surprised in the least bit if US Special Ops actions have already been running in and out of Pakistan.The Pakistanis are begiing to understand that although they dont think of the Afghan problem as theirs.The US impatience is..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Military, Politics, UpdatesBoots on the ground, budget cuts, Cross border US Actions, Indian Concerns, Pakistani flood action, President Obama, Taliban, US Military aid to Pakistan, VP Biden trip to PakistanRead moreWikileaks Update 1/8/11..The US wants info on its Twitter account.January 8, 2011jamesb1012 commentsYou can expect US legal action against Assange and his company sometime in the future..U.S. officials have issued a subpoena to demand details aboutWikiLeaksTwitter account, the group announced Saturday, adding that it suspected other American Internet companies were also being ordered to hand over information about its activities.In a statement, WikiLeaks said U.S. investigators had gone to the San Francisco-based Twitter Inc. to demand the private messages, contact information and other personal details of WikiLeaks founderJulian Assange and other supporters, including theU.S. Army intelligence analyst suspected of handing classified information to the site and a high-profile Icelandic parliamentarian.WikiLeaks blasted the court order, saying it amounted to harassment..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesJulian Assange, Subpoena issued, Twitter account, US Government Investigation, Wikileaks, Wikileaks Update 1/8/11Read moreNate Silver goes after Stu Rothenberg for a bad call.January 7, 2011jamesb1012 commentsNate is calling out Rothenberg on a call he made on April 23rd , 2009..On that date Rothenberg announced that the GOP could NOT win a majority of House seats in 2010Of course he was wrong..Silver of Fivethirtyeigth goes on to say that when Rothenberg actually started reading the polls etc. in 2010..He correctly came up with the closet GOP House gains..ButSilver wants Rothenberg to own up to the mistaken April 23rd call.Maybe he will.And maybe he wont..How Not To Take Responsibility For a Failed ForecastByNATE SILVERTheHouse race forecasts issued by Stu Rothenberg and his team on the eve of last Novembers elections performed extremely well.Not only did the Rothenberg Political Report project the overall number of Republican gains correctly  [a] likely Republican gain of 55-65 [House] seats, with gains at or above 70 seats possible, they wrote (the Republicans actually gained 63 seats in the House), but the Rothenberg team also did quite well in projecting the outcome of individual races.If you assess them one point for every missed won-loss prediction and half a point for each race in which they declined to designate a favorite and called the race a toss-up, then Mr. Rothenbergs team scored just 18 points on the night (fewer points is better), compared with 18 for Larry Sabatos forecasts; 19 for FiveThirtyEight; 29 for RealClearPolitics; 29.5 for CQ Politics; 31 for the Cook Political Report, and 33 for HuffPost Pollster (HuffPost Pollster did not issue forecasts in a few competitive races, so I assigned them the Cook Political forecast in these cases).The night after the election, once Id seen how well Rothenbergs team had done, I sent a note to Nathan Gonzales, the political editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, complimenting the team on their performance. Their forecasts have been quite reliable in the past as well, which is why we incorporate them  along with forecasts from Cook Political, CQ Politics and Mr. Sabato  into our own House race projections.Much earlier in the political cycle, however, Mr. Rothenberg had made a very silly forecast.Read moreNote .Stu Rothenberg is already out with a caution that Democrats have a better chance of retaking the House back than keep the Senate come the 2012 Elections.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Polls, UpdatesApril 23rd /2009 Rothenberg call, Macro vs Micro forcasts, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Polling giants, Predictions vs Forcasts, Stu Rothenberg political reportRead moreHow about a woman replacement for Robert Gibbs as White House Press Secretary?January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsIf Im correct the last woman to hold the office was Dee Dee Myers in the Clinton Administration.Are there any good ones from Chicage available?Politics Daily has a list of a few good women to choose fromThe White House is looking for a successor to departing press secretary Robert Gibbs, and the top prospects  as usual  are men. But PoliticosMike Allen says new chief of staff Bill Daley would like a woman in the job.A woman as the face of this administration  why, that would be something new and different.The most important qualities in a press secretary include access to the president, clarity of expression, ease on camera, and good relations with reporters. The names in the mix so far are deputy press secretaries Bill Burton (whod be the first black press secretary) and Josh Earnest, and vice presidential communications director Jay Carney.Its unclear how much influence Daley will have over the choice. MSNBC says hell have input, but incoming senior adviserDavid Plouffe will lead the search and have the biggest say. Its also unclear who if any of Washingtons major female players would take the job. Some of them have spouses and-or children; at least one already knows exactly how consuming the job would be because shes already done it.Still, Plouffe et al should take this seriously. There would be no better way to dilute the Club Men impression the Obama White House gives off. Here are some possibilities, some more famous than others and some more feasible (those who are declared Democrats, for a start):Gwen Ifill. Former New York Times reporter, current moderator and managing editor of PBS Washington Week in Review and senior correspondent on The PBS NewsHour, and author of The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama.
