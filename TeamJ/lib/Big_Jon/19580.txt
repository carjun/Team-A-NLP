We write because wehave this mad passion to share our ideas, our stories, and our information withthose whom we want to take the time and read our work. We are asking the reader to invest their precioustime.  This is a big ask.  Investors ask for promises, they want to seereturns on their investment. They want to be entertained, informed, gripped, emotionallyengaged and taken on a roller coaster ride of ideas.They need to see whats in store. They need a preview,a sample, a tease.This is especially important in a novel or ashort story. Readers can lose their interest very quickly. They know that theback cover blurbs, like film trailers, can paint a different picture to whatthey are actually about to read. So they turn the front pages, sneak a peekinto the first chapter or the first paragraph. They want to know what you areabout to say. They want to know whether you can deliver on a promise, whetheryou can say enough to sustain their interest.This is abig responsibility. We have a big story to tell, bursting with ideas.  We have so much to offer. But we run the riskof losing our very readership by a shoddy first few paragraphs.My Opening GambitShort Story: The Stone MermaidI was fifteen that summer I fell in love with a dead woman.

The competition asked authors to only submitthe first 200 words initially and on the strength of it they would pick 50 andask them to complete the story. Out of this 50 they would pick 5 winners to be broadcastevery afternoon, Monday to Friday. You canimagine my panic. However, it was perhaps the best experience in editing my ownwork that I ever had. I pruned, trimmed, discarded and mercilessly ripped bloatedpassages to shreds.  I was like a cheftrimming all the excess fat to produce a lean meat.In the end Iproduced 200 words of sheer concentration that had to grip, hook and impale myjudges to such an extent that they should want to read more. They did. I waslucky to be one of the winners much to my surprise and joy. More importantly,my opening strategy had worked. When I got the judges feedback, they commentedon various qualities of the writing, the imagery, the visual story telling but mostof all they said, the first paragraph made them want to read more. Hook, line and sinker!HOOK, LINE & SINKER!All throughhistory, great writers have teased their readers by gripping first paragraphs.  I have tried to illustrate some examples ofthe hook to give you an idea of what your readership may expect and findengaging. Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule.  But, as novice writers wanting to make a mark,we all know that every little helps!

THE PUZZLE HOOKThis openingleaves the readers with more questions than answers. These questions are theirown. Their curiosity is stoked. They want to know what, why, when, where andhow. There aremany masters of writing who use this hook. These writers tease with thesharpest hook: the puzzle, information or an incident that grips and sets yourbrain into overdrive.. They give you a brief glimpse of whats to come, a teaseof such alluring quality, it leaves the reader wanting more.There aremany examples of the quizzical hook:In his PulitzerPrize winning novel, Middlesex, Jeffrey Eugenides teases thus:I wasborn twice: first, as a baby girl, on remarkably smogless Detroit day inJanuary of 1960,and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Peroskey,Michigan, in August of 1974.  The Master ofthe hook was Charles Dickens, who of course serialized his novels in monthly orweekly periodicals, he specialised in hooks and cliff hangers, he pretty muchinvented the art of the tease. Consider how he starts, A Christmas Carol:Marleywas dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register ofhis burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and thechief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, foranything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.Consider alsothe fact that this first chapter also carries the title, Marleys ghost. Wasthere ever any doubt that the reader wasnt going anywhere.Consideralso the quaint but quizzical opening from Peter Pan, by JM Barrie:All children, except one,grow.   Awww.

You needto catch up as you go along. What you get is that the story kick-starts fromthe word go. Before you know it you are along for the ride.If you havea story that starts slap bang in the middle of an action packed scene, getright to it.  Scottish writer Alistair MacLeanwas a master of action thrillers, many of his books have been made intogripping films.  Heres his openingparagraph for his best seller, Where Eagles Dare:Thevibrating clangour of the four great piston engines set teeth on edge and madean intolerable assault on the cringing ear drums. The decibel level, Smithcalculated, must have been about that found in a boiler factory, and one,moreover, that was working on overtime rates. The shaking cold in that cramped,instrument-crowded flight deck was positively Siberian. On balance, he reflected,he would have a Siberian boiler factory any time because, whatever itsdrawbacks, it wasnt liable to fall out of the sky or crash into the mountainside.In his worldwidebest seller The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown, gets the ball rollingfrom the first paragraph:Reknownedcurator Jacques Sauniere staggered through the vaulted archway of the museumsGrand Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio.Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six year old man heaved the masterpiecetoward himself until it tore from the wall and Sauniere collapsed backward in aheap beneath the canvas. Lewis: NarniaIrving: Hotel New HampshireConrad: Lord Jim3.THE CHARACTER HOOKThis couldsimply be a description of the character, what they are up to, who they are andin general familiarise the readership with some of the cast. Try and imaginethe cast of your story, who is important enough to come at the beginning. IS itthe main protagonist? Is it the key but small character that sets the story inmotion?This could alsobe the simple beginnings like those of a fairy tale, Once there were threesisters... etc.CS Lewis beginshis classic series of Narnia:Oncethere were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy.John Irving startshis Hotel New Hampshire with a classic paragraph:The summer my father bought the bear, none ofus was born - we weren't even conceived: not Frank, the oldest; not Franny, theloudest; not me, the next; and not the youngest of us, Lilly and Egg.Or you couldget more specific and describe the character like Joseph Conrad does in hisclassic Lord Jim: He was aninch, perhaps two, under six feet, powerfully built, and he advanced straightat you with a slight stoop of the shoulders, head forward, and a fixedfrom-under stare which made you think of a charging bull Gibson: NeuromancerKingsolver: LacunaRoy: God of small thingsAuthor HubArturo Perez- Reverte : His pen and his (s)wordsArturo Perez- Reverte is the bestselling novelist in Spain. His historical adventures featuring the world weary swordsman for hire, Captain Diego Alatriste, are popular...4. THE SCENIC HOOKThis usuallybegins with a setting. The author gives a description of a place; a locationwhere the action is about to commence. This usually tests our descriptivestrategies as we try to be original. We can capture the colour, the smells, thenoises and the feel of the place. It is always better to use spare but distinctdescriptions that cater to our five senses. Just try and imagine the place inyour head, with your eyes closed, what do you see, what do you smell and taste,how hot, cold or warm does the place feel?There areonly so many ways of describing the sky.TrustWilliam Gibson, in his seminal sci-fi blockbuster Neuromancer, to comeup with:The skyabove the port was the colour of television, tuned to a dead channelBarbaraKingsolver, in her book The Lacuna, sets the scene in Isla Pixal, Mexico,1929:In the beginningthere were the howlers. They always commenced their bellowing in the first hourof dawn, just as the sky began to whiten. It would start with just one: hisforced, rhythmic groaning, like a saw blade...Or considerthe colourful, sensory explosion in the opening lines of Arundhati Roys 1997 BookerPrize winning The God of Small Things:May inAyemenem is a hot, brooding month. The days are long and humid. The rivershrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoes in still, dust green trees. Redbananas ripen, Jack fruits burst. Dissolute bluebottles hum vacuously in thefruity air.

THE PHILOSOPHICAL HOOKThis could ameditation of ideas, thoughts and opinions. This usually invites the reader toshare your vision and version. It may be a gripe of the state of affairs, aquibble about the past or even a hopeful dream about the future.Who betterto go back to, but our old curmudgeon, Mr Charles Dickens. He sets the scene sowonderfully in his Tale of Two Cities:"It was the best of times, it was the worstof times, it was an age of wisdom, it was an age of foolishness, it was anepoch of belief, it was an epoch of incredulity, it was a season of Light, itwas a season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter ofdespair."Heres Mark Twainsuccinctly underlining that the line that divides the poor and the privilegedhas not changed from the 16th century, in his The Prince and thePauper: In theancient city of London, on a certain Autumn day in the second quarter of the 16thcentury, a boy was born to a poor family by the name of Canty, who did not wanthim. On the same day another English child was born to a rich family by thename of Tudor, who did want him. All England wanted him too.Or considerthe simple truth of Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice:"It is a truth universally acknowledged,that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife."

THE OBJECT HOOKThis is somethingI have come across a few times. The author painstakingly describes an objectand shows depth of research and understanding. He or she goes through intricatedetails about the object only to reveal how this is connected to the tale.We go backto Alistair Maclean, for his wonderful start to his novel, When Eight BellsToll, where he goes into great detail about the classic gun.ThePeacemaker Colt has now been in production, without change in design, for a century.Buy one today and it would ne indistinguishable from the one Wyatt Earp worewhen he was the Master of Dodge City. It is the oldest hand gun in the world,without question the most famous and, if efficiency in its designed task ofmaiming and killing be taken as criterion of its worth, then its also probably the besthand-gun ever made....  When a PeacemakerBullet hits your leg you fall to the ground unconscious, and if it hits yourthigh bone and you are lucky to survive the torn arteries and the shock, thenyou will never walk again without crutches.. And so I stood motionless, notbreathing, for the Peacemaker colt that started this unpleasant train ofthought was  pointed directly at me...Stephen Kingsemotional classic, The Green Mile ( which was originally serialised in 6parts) starts with a note on the old sparky:Thishappened in 1932, when the state penitentiary was still at Cold Mountain. Andthe electric chair was there too, of course. The inmates made jokes about thechair, the way people always make jokes about things that frighten them but cantbe gotten away from. They called it Old Sparky, or the Big Juicy. They madecracks about the power bill, and how Warden Moore could cook his Thanksgivingdinner that fall, with this wife Melinda, too sick to cook.

THE DIALOGUE HOOKThis is theQuentin Tarantino style banter. The story kick starts with sparkling dialoguethat is razor sharp and gets the story going. Dialogue isalways tricky to write, more so when you want to make first impressions. Thereare some stellar dialogue writers, especially like the 87th precinctpolice procedurals author, Ed McBain. Here he combines tension and razor sharpdialogue for the opening scene of Hark:Gloriaknew there was someone in her apartment the moment she unlocked and entered.She was reaching into her tote bag when a mans voice said, No, dont. Herfingers were an inch apart from the steel but of a .380 caliber Browning. Really,the voice said, I wouldnt.... The Last Dance: He hadheart trouble, the woman was telling Carella.,  Told me he hadnt beenfeeling good the past few days. I kept telling him to go see the Doctor. Yeah,Ill go, Ill go, dont worry, like that you know? So I stopped by this morningto see how he was. Found him just the way. In bed. Dead.EPILOGUEThere are other hooks, other fresh ways of alluring the reader. Like a spider spinning a web and inviting the fly to come into the parlour. Like the Sirens singing to the hapless sea men.Obviously, the opener is not everything, it is the story that follows and the quality of writing that gets our reader hooked and wanting to come back for more. However, when we are starting out and trying to impress readers and publishers, the opener can be a useful ammunition.We need to find new ways of fresh bait to get our readers hook, line and sinker.Copyright   MohanKumar 2010 Docmo's PoetryChristmas Poem: Of all the GiftsPoem: The JigsawPoem: Angel on the Christmas TreePoem: Lazy WandererPoem: The SniperPoem: The BrookPoem: You-Me-HopePoem: Someone Kissed ...Poem: 'Tis the little things...Poem: Sands of TimePoem: Chasing DreamsPoem : The DeepPoem: My love is in knowingDocmo's Health HubsMenopause: Feeling hot, hot, hot!'Worried Well' and the 'Deniers'Tell me What it isPanic not : an answer to anxiety!.vote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...?

Thanks for dropping by.Sophia Angelique2 weeks ago Precisely. One doesn't have to start with the action. One has to start with a sentence that get's the reader's attention. That has has much to do with a writing style as a 'hook'. What has happened these last decades is that those who teach assume that one can teach storytelling. So, they've broken down and tried to describe what successful authors do. The bottom line is that a truly good writer/storyteller can break all those rules and still be successful. That's where the choice of words, the pace of writing, etc. comes into it. :)Docmo2 weeks ago Exactly! Writing is personal. We can be guided but not taught. It is just that, in the stiff world of competition and low attention spans, we are competing for readership with an 'MTV' approach of fast cuts, quick edits -so in order to gain foot hold, sometimes these steps help. But not always. As you say it is the quality of writing and the heartfelt passion that will out. thanks for dropping by! :-)Sophia Angelique2 weeks ago :) The old story. One can be taught the steps, but not the dance! :)Docmo2 weeks ago Yeah. We need to feel the music - inside us! ;-)Crewman62 weeks ago I enjoyed every sentence and every word.  You've also inspired me to re-read old favorites, and experiment with new writers.  Your hook was excellent.  Thanks for the wonderful read!richtwf2 weeks ago Great hub as always my friend and this has certainly given me some excellent food for thought! When I write, I don't tend to think so much about hooks, I just tend to go with gut instinct and how I feel and just run with it and if it feels right for me at the end then I'm content. If it doesn't feel right then I go back and have a re-think if necessary.Cheers for sharing and big thumbs up - Useful and awesome my friend.Docmo2 weeks ago Thanks Crewman6! I always love to revisit old favourites, see what made them ''old favourites' in the first place. At first we enjoy, now that I am writing, I am being more analytical to see what was the reason for enjoying some authors so much.Docmo2 weeks ago Dear friend richtwf, I am glad it has given you food for thought.
