Now Killed By An American Terrorist In Arizona    Tucson :  AZ :  USA|Jan 09, 2011By Veronica P Roberts         2 0     Views: 140      January 9, 2011, Tucson, AZ]-----Saturday's massacre in Tucson Arizona, claimed the lives of 6, including one special little 9 year old girl. Christina Taylor Green. Christina who reportedly loved ballet and was the daughter of a Los Angeles Dodgers scout and granddaughter of legendary Phillies baseball manager Dallas GreenDallas Green. What's so memorable about this young girl is the history of her birth and tragic, untimely death. Christina's advent into this world, was on a day that is etched into the memory of all of us. September 11, 2001. The day foreign terrorists used two planes, filled with people, as bombs to blow up the World Trade Center in New York City. The devastation was horrific. The death toll, almost 3000. The psychological and physical pain, incomprehensible. Now Christina dies at the hands of an America terrorist. The deep devastating irony of this tragedy must be unbearbale to this innocent child's family and friends. I did not know her, but I am stunned by the savagery nonetheless. We concentrate on profiling folks that wear beards and dress in Muslim garb. We spend billions on Homeland Security and intelligence, looking for terrorists from "over there." Incredulously, some of them are right here, home grown and right under our noses. What do you say to this little girl's family? What do you say to the family of the others slain and wounded? How do you fight terrorism when it's part of the very fabric of this country? We continue to look "over there" when we need to take an in-depth look at ourselves, our politics, our way of conducting the business of politics. The deep partisan rage. The constant dangerous sensationalizing of ideology that have reached the level of insanity for some. Saturday in Arizona is what you get when we don't take a better look at ourselves. This is not the first time violence has spilled innocent blood. This is not the first time crazy citizens have used guns to prove their irrational point. What is it with America that this keeps happening? R.I.P. little Christina. We as adults have dropped the ball. I apologize, though I know the apology is woefully inadequate.
