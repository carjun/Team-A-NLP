You show that in order for a democrat to have a 50-50 chance of holding a seat in 2010, Obama had to have a 55% vicory margin in 2008. I suspect that that might be much higher compared to 2004 and 2000. 2000 can arguably be the best "base line" as it was an election without an incumbent president (though you did have an incumbent VP running) and no major crisis (e.g. War on terror in 2004). As you have economic crisis/boom, popular/unpopular wars, etc. you would expect the election to skew off of that baseline.On the question of "aligning" vs "Re-aligning", the re-alignment, if it occurred may be ideological, not geographic. The exit polls and generic ballot polls all told of a sharp increase in the number of self identified as conservatives. If this self identification sticks (and there are plenty of reasons to argue why it will/won't stick), then it will that much harder to get the GOP incumbent out.The sharper geographic deliniation seems to not be regional but urban vs suburban/rural.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           2 Readers2.EvanBronx, NYNovember 9th, 201010:10 amI'm glad to finally see such a reasoned analysis of this election. Most of the headlines would have one think that the Democrats will now be in the minority for 20,000 years or something like that, having just lost 8, 000 seats in congress. The fact is, is that with the economy the way it is right now, this country is going to be quite volatile for a few years.It could just as easily shift back in two years.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           8 Readers3.PiddlesworthCaliforniaNovember 9th, 201010:11 amThere's something that I've thought you guys should do for about a year now, which is somewhat related to this topic, and now that the elections are over I think it would be a good time for you guys to consider it:You've previously done analyses for the presidential elections combining which states were the most "swingable" with the cost of advertising in that state and the value to the eventual outcome of swinging that state to create a composite score of which states were the most worthwhile (for investing campaign dollars in in this case).  You've also done analyses regarding how a congressperson's voting record compares to their district's political leanings.  What I would love for you to do, and I think it would be of great value to your readers, is for you to keep periodically updated lists of each party's most valuable congresspeople (for both houses).  This also would allow you to add an additional element to your election analyses: you could combine your projections for who is most likely to win with your evaluations of who is most worth-while to have win to each party (either relative to their district or relative to their opponent, or both) and come up with a score for which candidates the parties should be focusing most of their campaign resources on.Anyway, failing that last part, it would still be interesting to see who is pulling their weight and who is just sitting in a safe district and is actually deserving of a primary, rather than the vapid analysis we get from most pundits of "Centrist candidates aren't voting with the party, they should be primaried!"Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           4 Readers4.ZachAlexandria, VANovember 9th, 201010:11 amIf this is truly a realignment where all elections are national, then it is really bad news for Dems in the next two Senatorial elections since they significantly overperformed in 06 and 08. They will be defending seats in at least a dozen red states. Since seats are not apportioned by population, wouldn't your analysis suggest that the GOP is very close to getting 60 seats, were all senate elections to follow this pattern?Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           6 Readers5.LukeBellevue, WANovember 9th, 201010:12 amNate, one interesting thing I noticed in looking at the graphs is that, while the R-squared value went up, the best-fit line actually went down vertically quite a significant amount.  Whereas before 50% of the vote for Obama predicted 50% of the vote for the Democratic candidate in that district, it's now the case that 50% of the vote for Obama predicts about a 43% vote for the Democratic candidate.  Any thoughts on this and what implications it might have for what Democrats need to see in 2012 if they're to do well?Recommend                                           Recommended by 1 Reader6.RWNYCNovember 9th, 201010:12 amWhat is this, the Democrat lick-our-wounds and salvage-our-self-image column?Never trust a partisan with statistics.There is a simple straightforward conclusion from the findings reported here.  This partisan columnist doesnt want to put in these terms, but here it is:Some borderline conservative congressional districts thought they would take chance with Obama.  They voted for him and, after living through the past two years, didnt like what they saw  in fact, they recoiled in horror.  Now theyve gone back to voting conservative, for a long time to come.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           6 Readers7.Alan ALondonNovember 9th, 201010:13 amYou mentioned 'Republican inroads in governorships and statehouses on Tuesday night should give them more leverage over redistricting'. I think you may be misreading the data.Democrats won the Governorship in California (53 districts), New York (29 districts) and Illinois (19 districts). Republicans won Texas (32 districts), Florida (25 districts), Pennsylvania (19 districts) and Ohio (18 districts). The rest don't matter as much - they are smaller states with fewer congressional districts, it's harder to gerrymander 5 Congressional districts than it is to gerrymander 50.The loss of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida might hit harder because they are swing states and therefore it might be easier to redraw the map (perhaps an analysis with maps of potential gerrymandering would help).But out of the easily gerrymandered congressional districts, I count 101 under Democratic Governors, and 94 under Republican Governors.

Both the Tea Partyers and GOP regulars have seen what wins.  Oddball, losing-type Tea Party candidates will not make to the ballot and the regular GOP candidates will move towards them.  Further, the arrogance we've seen so far in their leadership and their media friends will keep them from adapting and the Dems will be stuck defending Peolsi if she lasts to 2012.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           2 Readers11.NSBordentown, NJNovember 9th, 201010:17 amI think it's a common mistake to look at big changes as "realignments."  More appropriately, each wave election is reflective of several miniature realignments.  Because each region of the country has a distinct cultural character, their votes will shift with their region more closely than it will with other parts of the country with similar demographics.For instance, in 2006 and 2008, New England completed a regional realignment to the Democrats.  The D's did well in other parts of the country, but those elections were not indicative of long term cultural trends.  In 2010, New England stayed blue, while the Democrats in flyover country got slaughtered.Similarly, Republicans have been waiting for half a generation to see Appalachia and the upper Midwest go red.  This may have finally happened with wins in MN-8, WI-7, WI-8, MI-1, OH-6, VA-9, and WV-1.  There will still be hereditary Democratic voting, (like we still see in the South, or in New Hampshire), and some right-leaning Dems like David Boren will slip through, but the regional shift has been made.  If I'm Collin Peterson, I'm polishing my resume.If I am right, the question for the future becomes: where will the next regional realignment be, and can the political numbers guys foresee it accurately enough to to take advantage?Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           6 Readers12.yogsterFlagstaffNovember 9th, 201010:18 amSounds like the problem boils down to Dems not getting out the vote. Late on Nov. 2 I offered my college students the chance to leave if anyone needed to vote. None left, and a quick survey indicated that only a handful voted. A big change from the general election.I don't know how we'll ever regain the 2008 momentum with Mr. Obama constantly kowtowing to Repubs, who clearly have no intention of working with the Muslim-Socialist-Alien (black guy). When he appeases the NO folks he loses huge numbers of "passion voters." I suspect that's a big reason we fared so poorly this time.He's passed some pretty good legislation so far, and I realize he was dealing with crises early on. But his and Mr. Gibbs' protestations aside, it ain't enough for him to do "pretty good stuff" when people want fundamental change. Yes, we still want that change, and not the "NO YOU CAN'T" kind. I voted for him this time, but with little of the excitement of '08 (bye bye, public option). Excitement is catching. So is cynicism. Courage inspires; it moves even stubborn people. I know he'd say he's practicing the art of the possible. I don't buy it. I still hold this probably-naive hope that he can bring good policy along, even amid the recent losses, if he gets out and leads with the people rather than sitting in his office, making phone calls to self-interested deal brokers. For example, we desperately need cap and trade (at minimum). It's a matter of survival. Who's going to get it for us? Mitch McConnell? When L.A. hits 119 degrees and Atlanta's water is gone, is Mr. Obama going to "apologize" for chasing change in millimeters?Can our president morph back to the guy he told us he'd be? We'll know the answer--and the results--in 2012.

He still won the Gulf Coast but not by enough to offset his big losses in the Piney Woods. The backlash against Obama and Pelosi turned many independents into anti-Democrats, but not really into Republicans.  It was an us vs. them election with all the focus on getting rid of "them." The "us" was not defined beyond being anti-them. This election was not an endorsement of Republicans. It was a repudiation of the Democrats.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           6 Readers14.coneymakerCincinnati, OHNovember 9th, 201010:21 amGreat post, awesome numbers!

The Dems have been taking a lot of flack from progressives for not pushing a more progressive agenda. Never mind that it was an impossibility given the number of Blue Dog Dems in the House and Senate.But now that's all about to change. For progressives, the loss of the House to the Republicans is tempered by fact that around 30 of those losses were for seats previously held by Blue Dog Dems.Because really, a big hunk of the "change" in House leadership is just a figment. It's pretty much like the same people just got up, changed political parties, and moved to the other side of the House, where they'll vote almost exactly the same as they always have.The difference is that now, when the progressive agenda isn't being pursued, at least it'll be obvious what the real reason is. And in the long run that's going to be good for progressives and good for the Democratic Party.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           7 Readers17.election delegateUSNovember 9th, 201010:24 amNice attempt at trying to find the silver lining in the shellacking Nate, but it's kinda hard not to see this as just spin.I should also point out -- your thesis that Republicans just won where Obama wasn't popular anyway -- how do you account for Republicans winning Obama's old Senate seat?Might want to rethink this article....Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           3 Readers18.Richard SmileyKokomo, INNovember 9th, 201010:25 amWhile the statistics unveiled here do not demonstrate that this is a "realigning election", it may actually involve significant realignment in a way which is difficult to detect.Our governments (Federal, state, county, municipal) involve geographically-based representation.  This is only natural.  A person exists in a particular place, at any given time.  And people move from one residence to another relatively seldom (though the pace of these moves has grown gradually, throughout the history of the United States).A hundred seventy years ago, communication  even mass communication  was fairly localized.  That has gradually changed with the rise of electrical and electronic communication.Changing migration and communication patterns change the scope of social organization, including political organization.  The tea parties which sprang up during the past two years are locality-based, a fact which should be reflected in the unique statistical characteristics of each district.  But a tea party's members also have significant, daily, long-distance communication connections to others, which should be reflected in a certain geographical homogenizing of the statistics.Is anyone polling in a way which would expose the non-geographical, social structure of the electorate?Recommend                                           Recommended by 1 Reader19.RudySan Francisco, CANovember 9th, 201010:26 amIt is a mistake to attribute the shifting vote patterns primarily to partisanship.  The realignment was along philosophical grounds, not partisan grounds.  The delta in votes was because of rejection of liberal policies, as has happened immediately every time after the left has gained control of the levers of government.  It was particularly telling that so many Democrats ran as conservatives, often avoiding declaring their party ID in nearly every contentious district.  But this time the voters had a track record to look at rather than buying into vague hope and change elicitations. As such, the voters clearly declared a preference for smaller, less intrusive government, particularly rejecting the cornerstones of the Obama agenda, which are d-e-d, dead.It is true that the delta in deep blue territories was insufficient to garner majorities for the more conservative candidates, a problem that may persist into perpetuiry for the right.  Such districts are disproportionately populated with those who are beneficiaries of big government, either through jobs or welfare.  Perhaps that will change once those people see that a smaller government footprint is good for private sector growth rather than sucking resources away from it.  What the charts do not show is that even in the deep blue territories, vote margins narrowed considerably.  The Dem firewall is held together only by pitting the taxtakers against the taxpayers, but that will only further reinforce to other voters the folly of redistributionist policies at the expense of economic growth.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           6 Readers20.laffinatyouSouth Bend, INNovember 9th, 201011:22 amThis is just another partisan liberal "analyst" trying to make excuses and pretend that the democrats didn't suffer a staggering loss last week.The biggest mistake I see with this analysis is that there is a built-in assumption that congressional carried the same weight for pro/anti Obama voters in 2010 as in 2008. Then that error is pushed forward to project the 2012 vote.There is also much too little emphasis placed on the historic shift of state legislatures from democrat to republican. That was even bigger than the stunning defeat of democrats in congress. The democrats aren't safe simply because they have California, New York, and Illinois. Those states are already heavily controlled by democrats and that didn't change. Their districts aren't likely to change. But they only account for 25% of the house seats. The republicans control a huge majority of the other 75% of the seats.This myth that the people will suddenly fall in love with Obama and the democrats when the economy gets better is shear insanity. In order to believe that, you have to buy into the psychotic belief Obama holds that this election wasn't about him and his liberal democrats. It was entirely about him and his liberal policies.Since Obama has signaled he doesn't get it and will keep doing what people screamed for him to stop doing, and that the democrats in congress don't get it and will put Nancy Pelosi , the poster-child for all that is wrong and bad about democrats, and will return Harry Reid to his seat of power. The democrats have guaranteed they will lose again in 2012 and may possibly seal their fate for decades.

Are you sure that the Democratic vote for Congress doesn't explain 83% of the vote for Obama?In the words of one critic: "Thus R2 gives the 'percentage of variance explained' by the regression, an expression that, for most social scientists, is of doubtful meaning but great rhetorical value. If this number is large, the regression gives a good fit, and there is little point in searching for additional variables. Other regression equations on different data sets are said to be less satisfactory or less powerful if their R2 is lower. Nothing about R2 supports these claims" [Achen 1982, p. 58]. And, after constructing an example where R2 is enhanced just by jointly considering data from two different populations: "'Explained variance' explains nothing" [Achen 1990, p. 183].Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           2 Readers23.ChadNCNovember 9th, 20102:45 pmI think it might be specious to assume that the independent vote consists of the same voters every election and that they occasionally 'experiment' with Democrats, then come to their senses and vote Republican the next time. It seems far more likely that it's simply about who turns out and who stays home. Meaning that there are very few examples of independent voters that literally start from a totally objective stance and make decisions each election based on candidates or issues, etc. If you say otherwise, I just don't buy it. Most 'independents' are bandwagon voters, IMO, that stay home when the messaging makes them feel bad for backing a 'failure' (Rs in '08, D's in '10.) With the current polarizing emphasis of the political discourse in this country, the idea that we're in for a period of volatility in elections from cycle to cycle passes the common sense test.While the post is interesting, and is certainly in part a bone thrown to those down and out in liberal-land, I don't share Mr. Silver's confidence that this might bode well for Democrats in '12. Business as Usual, here meaning Obama continues to play it reasonable in the ridiculously idealistic belief that he's going to get cooperation from across the aisle now that there is more balance among the branches, while the Rs continue to successfully push the narrative that Obama is forcing an uncompromising socialist agenda down our throats, will result in another bloodbath in '12, barring some outrageously unelectable R getting the nomination. It should be clear by now that the GOP is going to stick with what works, meaning blame the White House for any lack of compromise, for every second of time and every $ of our money wasted on the Hill with the 24-7 GOP election cycle. I mean, seriously, if I wanted to donate to the RNC, I would. The Congressional GOP spent the past two years wasting my tax dollars trying to win seats in '10 and doing nothing else. That's egregious, and I say shame on us for rewarding bratty, infantile behavior with a majority in the House.Unless something major, and I mean MAJOR, changes between now and '12, I don't see how there'll be more than a handful of D's inside the beltway...With that in mind, why doesn't the White House stop punting and playing defense? If you're going down no matter what, go down swinging! PUSH BACK! There are policies on either side of the aisle that I could personally get behind, but governing in Congress is no longer about policy. It's all about controlling public perception. You say the economy will recover, helping the Dems in '12? All that will happen is that the GOP will take credit for it, and say 'look, we've only in power for 2 weeks, and we've already fixed the economy!' and Obama will shake their hands and say 'congratulations!'  I voted for Obama, and it bothers me that I'll be judged badly for this because I'm a 'socialist,' or I'm an 'intellectual elite,' or I want to live in a 'Nanny State," while the real regret that I have is that the White House won't stick up for the roughly half of us that haven't been suckered into looking back on the Reagn administration with weepy eyes, as if it's some kind of sepia-toned old photo of great grandma.  He'd save my vote in '12 if Obama would see that he can't win by simply not playing the GOP's game. Maybe he's taking the 'high road,' but he's taking it straight to the ribbon-cutting at the opening of his (former president)ial library. There's more at stake here than relative tax rates, WAY more, and I need to see my President refuse to accept someone else's 'creative' version of his own administration's story.This past election is important for reasons that nobody seems to want to make noise about. The GOP has a massive PR firm masquerading as a news organization. They've successfully confused and frightened the older and elderly vote into thinking they have to get out and push the 'R' button to not only 'protect their interests,' but apparently to 'save the American way of life.' Big business, flush with cash for most of this year, couldn't be bothered to hire anyone, but they sure did have investment capital aplenty to throw around on attack ads. The only question now is, will they start investing in the economy now, or did they, too, learn too much from this election, and see that their cash is better spent on elections, and those elections go better for them with unemployment in the high 9's?Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           8 Readers24.BobPortland, ORNovember 9th, 20104:41 pmI love how Nat is being attacked for "partisanship" because the data doesn't conform to the ideological preconceptions of the 'Right".

Sure, you can blame the economy, but really it's because in 2008 everyone hated the Republicans so bad after 8 years of Bush, that they came out in droves to vote for Obama. Many of those people didn't vote last week.I know Conservatives want to think there has been a big shift towards them, but there hasn't. In the culture wars, there has been a shift away from them. Issues like abortion, gay marriage, stem cell research, don't ask don't tell, etc. they are losing, you can't put people's rights and freedoms back in the bottle once they've had a taste for them. As the older social conservatives die off, the younger generations have grown up always having abortion rights and having gay out of the closet friends and family (or at least people on TV shows they watch). And while Republicans are once again trying to brand themselves as fiscal conservatives, they sure haven't been in the past 25 years. And as long as they cling to outdated social conservative beliefs and try to push them on all Americans through big government, they will never succeed long term.
