(Wonder what Lethal co-starDanny Glover thinks about Mel these days?)Fortunately for Mel, the Baltimore Sun has a five-point "re-branding" plan for the foul-mouthed star, which includes joining Arizona's Minutemen Civil Defense Corps.If you're not familiar with Mel's most-recent rants, we've got a small dose for ya after the jump.

A judge entered a default judgment against him, ordering that he and his company, Dirty World, each pay the woman $750,000.Richie (a.k.a. Hooman Karamian) should be showing up for a debtor exam, scheduled in Phoenix for May 14, Bell says, during whichhe'll be made to answer questions about his finances.But as Bell points out, Richie told Los Angeles' KROQ radio on April 30 that his Web site pulls in about $130,000 a month.

Today, it's reported that James left the facility but quickly checked back in to continue trying to "save [his] marriage."Since he was outed as a serial cheater about two weeks ago, James has been linked to enough women to give Tiger Woods a run for his money -- and like Woods, James came to Arizona to try to cure his wandering wiener.Unlike Tiger's wife, it seems Bullock isn't buying the whole "addiction" excuse, and it's being reported that she is close to filing for divorce.According to the gossip site Radar Online, James got news of Sandy's divorce plans and tried to call her. Bullock, however, wasn't havin' it and refused to take his call, the site claims.That's when James decided to split from the facility.

Then he proceeded to put up the pornographic still-shots and video, Ferbrache claims in the lawsuit. (Click here for Courthousenews.com scanned-in version).A review of the "Who Is" information related to the domain, www.sharraferbrache.com  shows that the owner is a possible employee of Mandarich's (see below).The associated address in Scottsdale for the domain's owner is the same address and phone number as for Mandarich's Web-site management business. Mandarich is also featured on the site, which purports to be Sharra's "fan site."Warning to folks using work computers -- turn the volume down if you choose to log on!
