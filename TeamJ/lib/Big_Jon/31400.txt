The TSA has two goals - first to prevent another terrorist attack, and second to appear like they did everything they could to prevent a terrorist attack in the event one happens.  Decreased airline profits, flyers, or other negative externalities of increased security really aren't high on their priority list.The only two things that could get in the way of the TSA continuing to ratchet up security through every means possible is political pushback, either from the public/congress (possible), or the airlines (unlikely, given that the airlines complaining about security would probably bring a storm down on them).  Which is why you see them citing polls, instead of trying to argue on effectiveness or other grounds, given that the most bothersome security measures implemented over the last decade probably couldn't withstand serious scrutiny.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           25 Readers3.cr1NYCNovember 19th, 20103:44 pmHas it occurred to anyone else that maybe the recent switch to a more intrusive pat-down is designed to influence the passenger to accept the body scan as the lesser evil?

I read your other article on the polls about the screening and your analysis is right on.  The biggest problem with all this nonsense is how much money it is costing.  TSA has deployed an army of people at the airports with their health care, salaries, overhead, equipment and pensions adding up exponentially.  And, the whole thing does not work.  Perhaps you could do an article on how much this has all cost us since Bush implemented the stupid system after 9/11.  I bet the numbers would be staggering.

There is a huge set of government employees being trained to distrust everyone for the suspicious behavior of paying hundreds of dollars to take an airplane, which is public transportation.We have let our government get away with this.  Do we know how much this is costing?  Does anyone know how much these new machines cost?  Has their effectiveness at preventing crime been proven?  How much has any of this been examined critically?  Who gets to ask questions of the TSA and get answers?  Why do we continue to think that we can x-ray and frisk our way to security?  Why don't intelligent people point out the absurdity of this whole "strategy" as costly and ineffective, when US policies abroad continue to contribute to the cultivation of terrorist activity?Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           52 Readers9.JP WashingtonWashington, DCNovember 19th, 20103:44 pmYou better be careful with this type of analysis, Nate.

It was extremely low.  That was followed by a calculation of the probability that you'd die in a terrorist incident - also extremely low.  But the two probabilities were of the same order of magnitude, which suggests you should be very wary of instituting one to stop the other.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           35 Readers11.James R. EhrlerStanchfield, MNNovember 19th, 20103:44 pmNate,I appreciate the nuance in your analysis but the idea that there will be another 9/11 is ridiculous.  The protocols have changed as I pointed out in this letter to my Senator, Amy Klobuchar and which James Fallows at The Atlantic picked up:http://www.theatlantic.com...The most these new scans and gropes can hope to accomplish is to reduce the likelihood of a catastrophic on-the-person bomb.  Given the limitations on how much explosives one can carry and the potential survivability of modern aircraft, this seems like a pretty poor tradeoff if it is pushing more than a few people into their cars.What we should be looking to Congress to do is not make us safe at any cost (that is clearly impossible and is, in fact, not desirable), but what is the true cost/benefit analysis (including the liberty vs. security issues) for current and prospective TSA procedures.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           21 Readers12.CConnecticutNovember 19th, 20103:44 pmI can say with certainty that if they install the radiological scanners at terminal B in NYC, I will be driving much more often.

A majority of the general population, a majority of travelers?  I'd like to see polling done of people who travel at least somewhat regularly, perhaps once every 4 to 6 months, as these are the people who have to bear the brunt of such searches and who also reap the greatest benefit of any additional security they provide.  If a majority of the general population does not travel by air more than once a year (if that?), their only incentive is to ensure that the one flight they take is absolutely secure, and so they will support any policy that appears to make them safer. But for those who fly regularly, there must be a rationale analysis.  Given the fact that other than the so-called "underwear bomber" there has not been any other case of someone successfully sneaking an explosive devise onto a plane on their physical body, I question what exactly we're being protected against.  As was the case with the so-called "shoe-bomber", this appears to be a mix of overreaction on the part of the TSA  and an attempt to justify massive expenditure and demonstrate to the public that they are "doing something" - while  we in the U.S. have had to remove our shoes (not to mention sandals and flip-flops) every time we pass through security, in the 9 years since that event Europeans have not had to do so and have not suffered any consequences as a result.

Many people I know now avoid travelling into or out of the US by air.  That's fine for those in Canada who can drive across the border, but it means fewer trips bringing tourist money and business deals from places where people can only enter and exit by air, like Europe, Asia and elsewhere.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           7 Readers17.jphimselfRidgefield, CTNovember 19th, 20103:44 pmSo when we catch an attempted shoe bomber all our shoes must then be scanned.  OK, no big deal.  Then we catch a guy with explosives in his shorts, now all our shorts must be examined.In the middle east one bomber concealed the explosives in a body cavity.  If a similar event occurs on an American airplane will we next face cavity searches.  The pattern of reactive measures instituted to date suggests that it will.No one will fly under those circumstances and the terrorists will have succeeded mightily.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           35 Readers18.Pat KightAlbany, ORNovember 19th, 20103:44 pmI'd already got to the point of not flying more than once or twice a year anyway, because air travel has become such a thoroughly unpleasant experience. The "enhanced" screening is the straw that's broken this camel's back; I've just about decided that if I can't get there by train, I'm not going.

Many people rarely ever fly in an airplane and much of an airline's business is frequent flyers.  There seems to be a large disconnect if the polls are sampling the general population.  I fly a few quite a few times a year, simply for personal reasons and I know many people who fly very often for business.  I'd like to see the approval ratings for body scanners with a sample of people who fly no less than 3 times a year.Of course, I don't know what these results would show but my guess would be a drastically lower approval rate on these machines and isn't that what matters?  People are all too willing to relinquish freedoms that do not affect their own lives.

But the scanners are not the problem there. They have been rolled out on a fairly slow schedule: Here in Boston was one of the first, and there certainly was resistance, but it died down, as would be expected. Since fall 2007, 67 more airports have gotten the scanners, or an average of only about 2 per month. An many of those airports are very low volume affairs. Continuing that kind of rollout would not add to the problem.It seems clear to me that the current uproar is due entirely to the new pat-down procedures, which seem to have been rolled out everywhere across the country at the same time. That uproar was entirely foreseeable, and could have been mitigated by more intelligent planning and introduction.Now that both of these very visible procedures are in place (in addition to other less frequent visible and random non-visible measures), the traveler is in what they perceive as a no-win situation: they have only one option, to decline the scan, which many do not trust with their health or privacy, but then they must undergo an uncomfortable, and sometimes truly invasive, frisking. Security is now uncompromising, and there's no pressure valve for the traveler. I'd say this design will cause a good deal more than a 6% drop-off.I think the only answer is to discontinue the new pat-down procedures for all travelers, wait until the scanners are more widespread and accepted, and then make the scanners mandatory. That will be an easier pill to swallow, in the long run.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           2 Readers21.RiverboyChinaNovember 19th, 20103:44 pmI went through the full-body scanner last August in Boston with no problem. I work in China so I have little choice about most of my air travel, but what Nate Silver says is true  I no longer even consider flying New York-Boston or New York-Washington, unless its a feeder flight. I take the train or drive.The whole procedure has become very strange. Like Silver, I go through scanners with absolutely nothing in my pockets, but sometimes the buzzer goes off anyway.  I havent had to go through the new pat-down procedure, but suppose I had.Of course I am not a threat to any flight. Whats more, the TSA guy KNOWS this. I am 6-4, a little overweight, a late middle-aged businessman, most likely wearing a sports jacket. White, if it matters.In the past, if the buzzer went off, I might be subjected to abrupt, sometimes rude orders, but normally I forgot this pretty quickly (except when somebody stole my watch at the OHare security point). Now, I am going to have some guy feeling my junk.He knows Im not a threat. I know he knows Im not a threat. But for some reason he is still feeling my junk.  Even worse, he or she may be searching a three-year-old, or a 15-year-old girl, or say my 85-year-old mother who forgot to take off her watch, when we, and they, know there is no threat.On top of that, we all know that airport security is not the reason that a full-dress repeat of 9-11 is unlikely. Its the passengers on Flight 93 who get credit for that. Their resistance, plus installing secure flight deck doors, is the reason that airplanes themselves can no longer become weapons.Add to this to the radiation safety issues, the possibility that TSA staff will abuse their authority, make fun or people, or that unscreened creeps and pedophiles will join TSA  Im waiting for some celebritys body scan to be posted on the Web  all of which will happen at some point, if it hasnt already   is enough to make me look into the train for longer trips  Chicago? Montreal? How long is that drive? Maybe a more leisurely trip would be more rewarding, even a business trip.  Or maybe, as Silver says, I just wont make the trip.Questioning every passenger, as the Israelis do, would be fairer, more effective, and might even be quicker than this new procedure.In any case to me the marginal increase in security between the old procedures and the new ones  if there is one  is not worth extreme privacy violations, as well as the creation of a huge force entitled to invasively search anybody they please.Recommend                                           Recommended by                                           53 Readers22.tejasyanquiSan Antonio TXNovember 19th, 20103:44 pmI'm surprised you didn't mention that most of those polled don't fly, or don't fly much, or simply hadn't experienced the new procedures.I, for one, had intended to visit my elderly mother over Christmas.  Right now, I can't bear the thought of the time and effort required in general to travel by air; the thought that I might find myself being touched, including sensitive places, because the scanner (which I have done) gave a false positive, is just more than I can stand.Besides which, when I went through the scanner I didn't realize just how specific and detailed the view was.  Now that I do, I feel very uncomfortable.I am, btw, a 61 year old woman, not ordinarily prudish,  but not comfortable being touched by strangers in any circumstance.
