It's Phillip Merling, who was arrested last week on charges of hitting his pregnant girlfriend, holding a Renato watch. You remember who owned a large piece of Renato Watches, our old friend Scott Rothstein, who is scheduled to be sentenced on June 9 (my over-under isstill 25 years). He owned it along with his buddy Ovi Levy and another fellow called Daniel Mink. When Rothstein became a major sponsor of the Miami Dolphins, he gained access to the locker room and had the players and coaches pose with the watches. Click here to see the Renato-Dolphins photogallery, which includes head coach Tony Sparano, Kim Bokamper, and Ronnie Brown with Renatos.Today, though, isn't supposed to be about the NFL's corporate whoredom; it's about remembering the men and women who have fought and died for our country.No, we're not talking about ambushing boats full of aid activists and killing them.We're talking about soldiers fighting in wars to protect our freedoms (I know that definition disqualifies several of our more recent wars, but it's not the braveand suffering soldiers' fault that our leaderscan be totaldickweeds).And we're talking about freedoms like vodka eyeballing. The Sun-Sentinel just publicized this "dangerous new fad" and quotedan ophthalmologist about the damage it can do. Itis what issounds like --pouring vodka into one'seye -- eitherfroma shot glass orstraight out of the bottle. From the Sentinel: "Teens claim it gets them drunk quicker. Yes teens." Here's the thing -- it's totally fake. Surea fool here or there occasionally does it, but it's no "fad" and never will be. It ofcourse doesn'treally get you (much) drunker, and it hurts likethe billy-o. Think about it -- you're pouring alcohol in youreye. It makes no sense, and now, thanks to the Sentinel and other silly newspapers across the country, more teenagers will try it. Once. Then never do it again.

Sheriff.orgPollock with Jenne.Sheriff Al Lamberticalled a news conference yesterday todenounce the "indefensible" favors given by his agency to three-year NFLdefensive endPhillip Merling, who was arrested early Thursday morning on a felony domestic violence charge.The 25-year-old Merling, who joined the Dolphins in 2008,was ushered by deputiesout of theBroward County Jail through aside door to avoid waiting media andwas given a ride home by an unidentified BSO employee. The investigation appears to be centering on BSO Commander Alvin Pollock, who oversees the Broward County Courthouse. Pollock confirmedthis morning in a phone call with the Pulp that he works for the Dolphins, conducting security for gamesand performing other duties. Thickening the plot is the fact that Pollock, according to an internal BSO publication, is the brother-in-law ofBSO Maj. Keith Neely, who supervisesjail operations."I didn'thelp anybody,"said Pollock, a veteran deputywho is popular among judges andonce served as a personal assistant toformer Sheriff Nick Navarro.

Two law partners of thieving lawyer Anthony Bellettieri have been suspended for three years from practicing law for failingto heed warning signs that Bellettieri was stealing from the firm's escrow accounts. This from the ABA Journal: Although Bellettieri, who is now disbarred and serving a prison sentence, oversaw the Bellettieri Fonte and Laundonio escrow accounts, partners Robert Fonte and Tara Anne Laundonio were both signatories and should have paid more attention to red flags, a New York Supreme Court Appellate Division panel held in separate opinions last week.The appellate panel found that the two violated their "nonwaivable fiduciary duty" to protect the firm's escrow funds, and suspended Fonte for three years and Laundonio for six months... [Fonte and Laundonio] never even saw bank statements for the firm's escrow and operating accounts, according to a report by special referee Steven Krane. "When it comes to safekeeping of funds... the proper approach is 'trust but verify,' " he wrote.There were tons of red flags in the Rothstein case, not the least of which was the easily verifiable fact that the firm had a payroll of about $18 million yet was bringing in only $8 million in revenues. Rothstein's payment of hugebonuses and "loans," extreme spending, and erratic behavior should have also tipped off the lawyers. The fruits of Rothstein's outlandish Ponzi will be auctioned off next week at the Broward Convention Center on June 3 (above is an ad for the auction featuring the Princess Kimberly yacht and the $1.5 million Bugatti). Here's a link to the government website for the auction, which has numerous photos of Rothstein's former toys. That said, I sincerely doubt that either of them will escape the federal investigation, which continues toprogress at the speed ofgrass growing on a defunct golf course.--Speaking of green spaces,theenvironmental movement has become quite the refuge for scoundrels.Remember how thegarbage dump in Sunrise went by the name "Green Now"? Well,now we have the "Go Green Initiative" by the Broward County School Board. It involves outgoing School Board Member BobParks,Florida Ethics Commission ChairmanRoy Rogers, millions in taxpayers' money, and a bunch of dubious "butterfly gardens" atthe public schools.It proves once again that when our officials talk about "green initiatives," it's usually really about cold cash.

Hell, the feds' information for her arrest includeddocumented visits to bars, and who could forgetthe infamous FBI party boat. Miami Herald GallagherHad the former School Board member gone to trial, you really would have heard all about her boozing (actually, she drank mostly wine). The incessant partying with undercover FBI agents wasgoing to be the basis of her defense. Her very capable defense attorney, David Bogenschutz, was going to to arguethat the agents fed her weaknesses, namelygot her shitfaced,to get her to agree to fix school contracts for illicit cash and the promise of a job. Theremaybe bea smidgen oftruth in that, butwhen Gallagher certainly didn't repent when she woke up in the morning -- or kick the undercover agents out of her figurative bed. She was just as dedicated to the corrupt scheme as ever. And there were plenty of lunch meetings as well, including the one involving the notorious doggy bag. The truth is that real lobbyists also use alcohol to lubricate politicians all the time.Hell, lobbyist Dave Ericks bought a bar (Clyde & Costello's) near the Capitol in Tallahassee for exactly that purpose. -- Supposed ethics champion Roy Rogers may have had anotherreason to vouch for Gallagher in a letter to her judge other than friendship. It turns out that Rogers,who serves as chairman of the FloridaCommission on Ethics, relied on Gallagher's vote to help him win millions of dollars in contracts off the More >> Write Comment Email to Friend Help Team SchemeFlorida Ethics Czar Asks for Leniency for Corrupt School Board MemberBy Bob Norman,                                                            Thu., May 27 2010 @ 2:05PMCategories:                                                                                                                                                            Help Team Scheme Sun-SentinelThis shot by Mike Stocker should have won a Pulitzer.The top ethics official in Floridapenned a letter asking a federal judgeto show leniency for former Broward County Board Member Beverly Gallagher, who has pleaded guilty to bribery and other federal charges that stemmed from an undercover FBI corruption investigation. RogersFlorida Commission Ethics Chairman Roy Rogers wrote the letter for Gallagher on May 23, and it was filed in court byher defense attorney yesterday along with several other such letters. "I am requesting leniency in consideration of her overall character," Rogers wroteU.S. District Judge James Cohn in a handwritten letter dated May 23. "I have known Beverly for over 25 years. During that time she consistently and passionately advocated for students. Her communication with decision makers locally and in Tallahassee enured to the benefit of the Broward School District." Considering Rogers is the state's top ethics official, it's good to know he's so forgiving of a public official who offered to sell out her office -- and try to fix school construction contracts -- in exchange for cash (some of which she famously stuffed in a doggy bag) and promise of a job from agentswho pretended to be "quasilobbyists."Rogers, a Charlie Crist appointee, is also chairman of the Broward Fair Campaign Practices Committee. He was also an executive with Arvida when it built Weston on the Everglades. I have a call into Rogers and am waiting forcommentto my question: "What were you thinking?" Another boneheaded letter came from "Mothers Against Predators" President Jaemi Levine -- who is actually running for the seat being vacated byBoard Member Stephanie Kraft. "I know she must pay for her mistakes but I would ask for leniency in her sentencing," Levine wrote. PlattNo, Jaemi, not "mistakes." Mistakes are things you don't mean to do. They are accidents. What Gallagher did is called a "crime." The fact that you don't know the difference doesn't bode well for your political career (or perhaps it will bring you great success). There is one letter, though, that is even more interesting than those two. It is from prolific Broward County lobbyist George Platt. If anybody knows about the corroding effect lobbyists have on whatever integrity public officials might possess, it's Platt. He's hired relatives of politicians (in-trouble Diana Wasserman-Rubin's husband RichardRubin comes immediately to mind) and done his share of wining and dining (KristinJacobs has visited his vacation home in North Carolina). He writes the obligatory "she was a great official and please be lenient" kind of stuff but then writes something that seems heartfelt and thoughtful, maybe even a bit confessional.

The Judge Gehl StoryBy Bob Norman,                                                            Thu., May 27 2010 @ 8:59AMI'm fixing to go off on Steve "Gasbag" Geller (maybe this afternoon), but first I think we need to talk about Broward County Judge Peggy Gehl.Wright Muir doesn'thave a light.Gehl was recently criticized for what Public Defender Howard Finkelstein in a letter called racist, demeaning, and inappropriate statements. Maybe so, but they are alsoentertaining as hell-- the woman was apparently a stereotype-slinging sensation. During her birthday party last year in a jury room, Judge Gehl needed a light for the candles on her cake, according to Finkelstein. She turned, naturally, to Jamaican-American assistant public defenderGhenete Wright Muir and said, "You have a light." Muir said, no, actually she doesn't. Gehlsaidthat she must have one because she smokes.No, I don't smoke, said Muir. "Yes, you do smoke, because you have dreadlocks," Gehl told her.Can you picture this? An older white female judgeinsinuating toayoung go-getting black female lawyer that she must be a pot smoker?Wright Muir, by the way,was recently a candidate for the Sunrise City Commission (her campaign video is included after the jump).What ignorance. What pigeonholing. What prejudice. Peggy Gehl, you're amazing. It gets a little more serious, though, when you look at Gehl on the bench.

Parks, who was first elected to the board in 1986 at age 41, UPDATED: made the announcement today, citing retirement as his reason.ParksParks, facing his first opponent since 1998, may have had a tough reelection in front of him against Rupert.The School Boardisbroke and deeply indebt after it sold out tothe construction industry and lobbyists during the building boom.Layoffs andcuts willlikely be the norm for the near future. And Parks, of all the board members, has a long history of chumminess with lobbyists and construction-industry folks. Hewas recently skewered here and elsewhere when the board voted to name a new athletic field at Coconut Creek High School after him. When School Board auditors determined that hurricane cleanup firm AshBritt had ripped hundreds of thousands of dollars off fromboard, Parks (along with Stephanie Kraft) came to the defense of the company and insteadattacked the auditors for their findings. On top of all that, a continuing investigation by the FBI that has already led to the criminal conviction of Beverly Gallagher continues.It makes it a cold season for incumbents, especially dubious ones like Parks. But sources say that Parks won't cite those controversies as a reason for leaving.

Davie.tvEisinger, left, with Davie Mayor Tom Truex and Davie Commish Susan Starkey.It all began when a citizen had the audacity to criticize Mayor Debby Eisinger. Longtime resident and former City Commissioner Gladys Wilson, speakingduring the public-input part of the meeting,said that Eisingerhad liedduring a previous meeting about the state's red-light camera bill. Wilson said that Eisinger claimed that Gov. Charlie Crist had signed the red-light bill during the March 11 meeting, giving the commission the green light to discussit. The problem was that the bill has not been signed (Cristactually signed the controversial legislation March 13). "Why did the mayor feel compelled to lie?"Wilson asked. That's when Eisinger interrupted. "You know what,Mrs.Wilson, you are out of order because that is aslanderous comment,"the mayor said.Wilson, whoisn't one to be trifled with, immediately mentioned the First Amendment and demanded that she be allowed to finish her allotted three minutes. Wilson at b-day party"She is being asked to sit down," said Eisinger. "Does any commissioner object to my ruling her out of order? Her behavior is totally inappropriate; she is not in compliance with the rules." Again, Eisinger repeated "she is totally out of order" andtold Wilson, "Please take your seat; there are Boy Scouts here this evening, and if you could show somedecency and respect... it would be greatly appreciated." "Why didn't you show decency and respect to us?"snapped Wilson. Then Eisinger unilaterally called the meeting into recess and walked out of room. The problem is thatthe mayor didn't have the authority to pull off such a stunt."The meeting is still in order," said a city staffer. "The mayor cannot recess the meeting under the proper rules."Another unidentified city official pleaded with Wilson: "There are children here, Gladys, please. Gladys, there are young children here..." "Don't you repeat that to me one more time," said Wilson. "Just shut it."You cansee it on thevideo after the jump.

When people see Mele come intotheir town they might as well be looking at swarm of locusts -- bad thingsare going to happento their land.MeleDon't worry about Mele though, he's got to be used to it. He's been in many rooms packed with a crowd of angry and emotional residents who'd like to ring his neck for trying to ruin their neighborhoods. He's not worried about those people. Mele, who worksfor the heavily political Ruden McClosky firm,is only worried about the handful of people sitting on the dais, the politicians whom he hastried to convince, with both words and cold cash, to support whatever perceived evil project he's backing. Therearguably has been nosingle man who has done more to try topaveovergreen space in South Florida than Mele during the past decade.He pushes for oversized developments(the Davie Commons is an example)at a breakneck speed. The man seems to be on a one-man jihad against the environment, advocating for development on wetlands, parks,mobile homes, neighborhood golf courses, you name it. Nothing is sacred is Mele land. You think you've seen a bad guy? You ain't never seen a bad guy like this. He is, of course, only doing his job. Melemakes big money and for every hated project he represents, there's a developer behind him. And he gives big money away in the form of campaign contributions. He andhis firm raise huge amounts of money for politicians, who are routinely showered with $500 checksduring fundraisers at Ruden McClosky's well-appointed offices in downtown Fort Lauderdale. To be fair,he's also meticulous about his business, knows how to spin like atop,andis familiar with the projects he backsinside and out. Tonight Mele, a former Coconut Creek city manager,willagain be in one of those packed roomsfull of people whohate what he stands for.He'll be at Sunrise City Halltrying to pushthrough a crucial rezoning for the massive Everglades Corporate Park onthe western side of the Sawgrass Expressway -- a place where there wasmeant to be no development at all.
