It would be great to work with others on the article. It might be a while before we should go for FA or even GA though, as I suspect we wont see a resolution this year, and it might not be until another few months till we have good academic sources which summarise the various views and put the current episode in historical context. You've made a lot of good additions to the article, but if we're going to be working together I hope you aren't too strongly in favour of tags? I consider them unsightly and ineffective. There are backlogs with thousands of articles and so IME they rarely attract helpful editors and possibly discourage readers who would otherwise make corrections, Ive had sometimes dozens of corrections in a month from IP editors on untagged articles. For the neutrality tag Ill reply on the talk page to see if we can clarify what changes you consider necessary to make the article NPOV. FeydHuxtable (talk) 08:14, 11 October 2010 (UTC)Okay, lets give it a shot. As long as you dont mind possibly doing more than half the work as Im not sure how much wiki time Im going to have over the next few months. Even if it fails at GA level at least we'll be improving an important and topical article. I was worried before that it would be hard to provide proper context without straying into borderline OR, but since then sources have started to come out comparing the current situation with the 1930s. I think we should keep our use of economists forums to a minimum to save arguments about whether they're compliant with policies , but there should be articles coming out in the journals soon. There are already some on Vox we could use. I dont know anything about DYK so Ill leave that side of things to you. My degree is in physical chemistry, I don't have formal training in economics but do have some practical experience both from the market and government perspective having worked at investment banks and at Whitehall. FeydHuxtable (talk) 11:46, 19 October 2010 (UTC)Just the fact that "According to Brazil's finance minister, Guido Mantega, an international Currency war has erupted" seems like it could be a key hook for DYK? FeydHuxtable (talk) 12:04, 19 October 2010 (UTC)Two good public think tanks for economic issues are CFR and CEPR Not strictly think tanks, but arguably better in terms of quality of analyses and success in influencing policy makers are the FT and Roubini's Global Economics. The latter two have loads on Currency War, especially the FT, though you have restricted access unless you become a paid subscriber. (FT is great value if your seriously interested in international finance) Wall Street Journal can be good especially for a more hawkish perspective, though I havent had a chance to check it out recently. For a cross between a think tank / accademic Journal / economists forum you cant really beat VoxEU which I already linked you to. FeydHuxtable (talk) 17:19, 20 October 2010 (UTC)Great additions with the maps. Sorry I havent had the chance to contribute recently, im still up for working with you to get this to at least GA level, but it might not be to mid November before I can do much. FeydHuxtable (talk) 12:01, 27 October 2010 (UTC)Yep we should defo include some of those links you added. Re the G7, the source said "the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and G7 in Washington" Youre right there wasn't a formal G7 meeting this month, but historically G7 delegates like to have their own private meetings at the IMF get togethers and it looks like the source was referring to this. It may be misleading to some readers and wouldn't be worth spelling out in detail as the G7 is far less relevant these days now India and China are more significant to the global economy than most G7 members, so i think its best just not to mention it.FeydHuxtable (talk) 13:30, 27 October 2010 (UTC)Just made a major edit to the article, think we're more than half way to GA class now.  FeydHuxtable (talk) 20:26, 28 December 2010 (UTC)An issue reducing the coherance of the article is that we have reactions spread out among Reactions , Global perspectives and the main Competetive devaluation after 2009 section. Im planning to move most of the reactions to the relevent sub section in global perspectives, adding text to indicate the month where the statements were made. Let me know if you have other preferences. FeydHuxtable (talk) 13:36, 29 December 2010 (UTC)Sorry to hear that, the article would be much less balanced and globalised without your excellent input. Let me know if you change your mind, I'll still improve it but probably wont get round to trying to promoting the article if its just me. Best of luck for whatever you're doing next. FeydHuxtable (talk) 19:45, 9 January 2011 (UTC)[edit] 2010 Copiap mining accident barnstarsHi again. I would like to award some barnstars to the main contributors, especially the indispensable Spanish translators. Do you think that {{subst:The Rosetta Barnstar|message ~~~~}} is appropriate for all the translation work? If so, do you have suggestions for doing so? Thanks again for your advice and cheers! Veriss (talk) 18:46, 19 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] November copy edit driveGreetings from the Guild of Copy Editors Backlog Elimination Drive!The Wikipedia Guild of Copy-Editors invites you to participate in the November 2010 Backlog Elimination Drive, a month-long effort to reduce the backlog of articles that require copy-editing. The drive will begin on 1 November at 00:00 (UTC) and will end on 30 November at 23:59 (UTC). The goal for this drive is to reduce the backlog by 10% (approximately 500 articles). We hope to focus our efforts on the oldest three months (January, February, and March 2009) and the newest three months (September, October, and November 2010) of articles in the queue.Sign-up has already begun at the November drive page, and will be open throughout the drive. If you have any questions or concerns, please leave a message on the drive's talk page.Before you begin copy-editing, please carefully read the instructions on the main drive page. Please make sure that you know how to copy-edit, and be familiar with the Wikipedia Manual of Style.Awards and barnstarsA range of barnstars will be awarded to active participants, some of which are exclusive to GOCE drives. More information on awards can be found on the main drive page.Thank you; we look forward to meeting you on the drive! The UtahraptorTalk to me/Contributions, S Masters (talk), and Diannaa (Talk)[edit] Chechen parliament attackI'd like to draw your attention to my comments here. This edit was misguided (even the headlines say it was "Islamists" [1]). I'd also be grateful if you would avoid using Kavkazcenter as a source in the article. Offliner (talk) 17:34, 19 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] KavkazcenterI have to ask: did you conduct any basic research before you started inserting material from the site and edit warring to keep it? [2][3]. Honestly, I find your actions in the article disruptive. Please stop. Offliner (talk) 07:44, 20 October 2010 (UTC)I have undone your revert. My edit is explained clearly on the talk page and is the direct action resulting from an WP:ANI report concerning your activities based on the consensus that appears to be in place over that particular website. If you disagree, take it to the ANI board or to the RS board to establish new consensus. Edit warring is disruptive and I don't want to see it happening on that page please. S.G.(GH) ping! 08:43, 20 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] DYK nom"Late nomination" means just what you would expect it to mean. DYK deals with new articles. This is defined by the DYK rules as meaning articles either created or having experienced a 5x expansion during the previous 5 days. The article you submitted was 19 days old and had not seen any growth large enough to qualify as recently expanded. Additionally the nomination was made for a date that was in the process of being closed out, not a date where DYK is looking for new submissions. For further details on this I would recommend you consult the DYK rules here and here. --Allen3talk 11:52, 20 October 2010 (UTC)DYK articles need to be either created in the last five days or have undergone a 5x expansion during the last 5 days. There are exceptions for dealing with copyright violations and DYK is more lenient during slow periods. DYK has had to recently enlarge update sizes to handle the high backlog however, so none of the exceptions appear to apply. If you know it will take more than five days to --Allen3talk 12:42, 20 October 2010 (UTC)Wikipedia talk:Did you know would be the place to propose a change to the DYK rules. Based upon my experience however, it is unlikely you would gain much support for such a proposal. --Allen3talk 12:46, 20 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] List of Israeli AssassinationsHi Lihaas,I responded to your reversion at Talk:List of Israeli assassinationsBest, GabrielF (talk) 01:40, 21 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] WP:SYNAre you aware of the guideline WP:SYN? If not, please familiarize yourself with our basic guidelines before continuing to edit. This edit is completely unacceptable. The incident did not happen anywhere near Grozny (are you familiar with basic geography of the region?) and there is no indication it has anything to do with the attack on the parliament. Offliner (talk) 13:04, 21 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] 2010 Copiap mining accident copy edit slavery!The Copyeditor's BarnstarIn sincere appreciation for your hard work and patience fixing things, correcting sentence construction, gramar grammer grammar and style on a sometimes bi-lingual, hugely popular breaking news article about teh the recent 2010 Copiap mining accident. Muchas gracias! Veriss (talk) 03:15, 23 October 2010 (UTC)Reply: It's quieted down a lot since it fell off the main page. I think it's looking really clean now after the mobs had fun with it - it was a bit wild there for a bit! Since it had slowed down I wanted to pass out the barnstars to those who had earned them. Seemed like the right time to do it. I think I'll request reassessment soon and that may generate some more tasks so I wanted to keep the hard workers interested. There will probably be some 'GA' or 'A' class awards or some thing along those lines to pass out once we get through that bit too. Stay tuned! Cheers, Veriss (talk) 06:16, 23 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] TalkbackHello, Lihaas. You have new messages at Veriss1's talk page.Message added 17:03, 23 October 2010 (UTC). You can remove this notice at any time by removing the {{Talkback}} or {{Tb}} template.[edit] Speedy deletion declined: Strong agnosticismHello Lihaas. I am just letting you know that I declined the speedy deletion of Strong agnosticism, a page you tagged for speedy deletion, because of the following concern: These are not speedy deletion criteria. Please review WP:CSD, especially WP:CSD#Non-criteria. Thank you. JohnCD (talk) 11:21, 24 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] Bahraini electionI would strongly advise against it. The infobox is a pain in the arse - unless you have a country where there are only two parties, then the infobox is either too large (especially on smaller resolutions) or ends up being an NPOV violation, because not all parties are included in it. It is not used on all election articles, because I have not used it in any of the hundreds of election articles I have created for the reasons mentioned above.  57 14:42, 25 October 2010 (UTC)But therein lies the point - how do you decide how many parties are "big winners"? A huge POV issue there.  57 14:52, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Al Wefaq is definitely without any question an opposition party. Also, where did you read about the "National Islamic Forum"? Can you send me the link? Most likely it is an English translation of Al-Menbar Islamic Society ("Al Menbar" is sometimes translate as "Forum" or "Tribune"), but there are so many different translations and so many different parties with similar names its hard to be sure. Send me the source and I will clarify. --Arabbi (talk) 18:46, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Okay I checked the AFP link and National Islamic Forum is indeed referring to Al-Menbar Islamic Society, as that is the local wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. --Arabbi (talk) 09:11, 26 October 2010 (UTC)The official results are here: http://vote.bh/candidates_46/candidates.html but it is all in Arabic. i will try to translate over the next week --Arabbi (talk) 09:51, 6 November 2010 (UTC)[edit] More speediesThose were better, because you cited speedy criteria from WP:CSD, but I still declined them. The reason is that redirects are cheap - they take up little space on the servers, and if there is even a possibility that they might be useful a redirect from mis-capitalisation or common mis-spelling is usually kept - see WP:R, particularly WP:R#KEEP. For that reason the specification for WP:CSD#R3 is "Recently created redirects from implausible typos or misnomers", and that is the only speedy for a redirect, apart from WP:CSD#R2, redirect from the article namespace into another space (which happens, for instance, when an autobiographical article is userfied to the author's user page).When you find an article more or less identical with another, often turning one into a redirect, as you quite rightly did on one of these, is a better option than {{db-a10}}.If an article really fits one of the speedy criteria, you should need no extra words to explain - a simple {{db-person}} or {{db-vandalism}} should be enough. Conversely, if you find you need extra words, it may indicate that the article doesn't really fit the speedy. Note that although {{db-a7}} is OK, it is better to use the specific ones like {{db-band}}, {{db-corp}} etc, because they produce a rather more specific message in the deletion log. Regards, JohnCD (talk) 15:06, 25 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] Is this a blatant bad faith edit?It's hard for ne to afford you the benefit of the doubt and thus good faith seeing that in this edit you simultaneously removed three external links that appear to me to constitute reliable sources for the article while at the same time slapping the article with {{unreferenced}}, {{original research}}, {{advert}} and {{coi}}. Can you offer some explanation for all of this? __meco (talk) 19:02, 25 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] Incremental indentation of paragraphsIn this edit you submit a post containing three paragraphs. For some reason you indent each paragraph incrementally. This is completely pointless and it makes for reduced readability. Please adhere to WP:INDENT when you post discussion entries and keep your pragraphs on the same level, of course with the usual exception for insertion of quotations. I encourage you to refactor the submission in question. __meco (talk) 10:47, 26 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] List of designated terrorist organizationsHello Lihaas! Indeed we really want to add more countries, but the problem is that we only know about the official lists of those 7. If you could find the lists of more countries that would be great. For instance China, Israel, Pakistan, etc. The lists are really difficult to find. Nicolas1981 (talk) 12:06, 26 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] Community restrictionsThe article List of designated terrorist organizations, along with other articles relating to The Troubles, is currently subject to active arbitration remedies, as laid out during a previous Arbitration Enforcement case that closed in October 2007, and was amended by community consensus in October 2008. The current restrictions are:All editors on Troubles-related articles are directed to get the advice of neutral parties via means such as outside opinions.All articles related to The Troubles, defined as: any article that could be reasonably construed as being related to The Troubles, Irish nationalism, and British nationalism in relation to Ireland falls under WP:1RR (one revert per editor per article per day).

Currently, it looks like we will achieve our target for reducing the backlog by 10%, however, we still have huge numbers for 2009. We have 55 participants in this drive. If everyone just clears 2 articles each, we will reduce the backlog by a further 110 articles. If everyone can just do 3 articles, we will hit 165. If you have yet to work on any articles and have rollover words, remember that you do need to copyedit at least a couple of articles in this drive for your previous rollover to be valid for the next drive. There are many very small articles that will take less than 5-10 minutes to copyedit. Use CatScan to find them. Let's all concentrate our firepower on the first three months of 2009 as we approach the end of this final drive for the year. Thank you once again for participating, and see you at the finish line!

Remember to check the talk page for controversial topics such as Pedophilia before altering definitions of those topics. Most of the time, the leads (intros) of such articles have been extensively discussed and worked out on the talk page. This is the case for the lead of the Pedophilia article. "Child sexual abuse" is in the distinguish tag because that is the act, while pedophilia is about the mental (what goes on in the mind) in relation to the act. Child sexual abuse is a common aspect of pedophilia, and is largely what pedophilia is about, yes, but they are not the same thing. Some child sexual abusers are not even pedophiles, as the article makes clear.Also, describing pedophilia as "child friendship" in the lead is highly controversial, as many pedophiles actually describe the relationship that way and believe it to only be about friendship and that they are not hurting the child. This is why I reverted you.As for your OR and synthesis concerns, I did not mean to revert that, and it would be best that you bring that up (what you meant by that) on the talk page.

While I don't have any links to previous discussions available, this has been discussed several times in the past and American is the primary use. Vegaswikian (talk) 00:14, 13 December 2010 (UTC)I know that you believe that using the adjectival American may be ambiguous, but in practice it is not. In the move discussion all of the comments made it rather clear that not only is this the correct common name, but it is also not ambiguous. Yes there is one response, where the editor still opposed the move, saying that this point might merit more discussion, but also mentioned WP:COMMONNAME and suggested leaving this alone. So after rereading this discussion again, I don't see any reason why the close was not proper. Clearly your concern here was address in most if not all of the comments. BTW, I believe that most of the discussions about the adjectival American not being ambiguous were at WP:CFD several years ago.

However, I think that writing "fishes" is correct too.Here I copy a sentence from the article English plural:"And the word "fish" itself is also troublesome, being generally used as a plural when in the context of food, but forming a regular plural otherwise (thus "three lots of fish and chips", "the industry landed 5,200 tonnes of fish in 1998" but "the order of fishes", "the miracle of the loaves and fishes", the phrase "sleep with the fishes"); usage does vary, however, so that for example the phrase "five fish in an aquarium" might to another native user be "five fishes in an aquarium". Using the plural form fish could imply many individual fish(es) of the same species while fishes could imply many individual fish(es) of differing species."Here, we were talking about several groups of "fish", so this writing is correct, no? Besides, I'm not a native english, so feel free to contradict me.PS: As a biologist, I'm in favor not to use the word "fish" at all, but I'm a little extreme in that way;) N@ldo (talk) 19:53, 23 December 2010 (UTC)[edit] Template:Bihar legislative assembly election, 2010{{help}} Could someone help me create a gap above the "national democratic alliance" as there is below it?

We were continuing discussion where i also told the editor to in fact add the content (of which i was RESTORING previously removed CITED content. See the talk page of the article adnt he users talk page. reading the trail of discussion leading to his response would show the issue was moot. i had also already said onthe talk page that i would NOT be editing that page so the question of warring would not arise.Furthermore, one can also note that the editor was new and unaware of policies that he resoirted to ANI. ive duly explained what i edited and reverted unexplained multiple edits thus contrued as vandalism which removed cited content without explanation.Secondly, also see the last 2 "reverts" the editor filed and you will not it was in fact vandalism. read his edit summary and youll see the editors POV on a current event. ([5][6][7][8]) I mean the admin who blocked has clearly not even seen it as his responsementios no reason thereof. I dontknow how the other editor played a modeating role when he lodged a complaint at ANI without a warning. Furhter dont know on what basis an admin can even accept this.youre goign to punish veteran editors cleaning the current event page on the whims of those who hae not even edited in months?WP:GAB also states "that the block is no longer necessary because you understand what you are blocked for, you will not do it again, and you will make productive contributions instead. " in which case the dispute was resolved before blocking.Also the block message says "discuss controversial changes and seek consensus. If that proves unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek dispute resolution, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request page protection." Which was beign discussed on the talk page at the point that the dispute had in fact come to agreement with the reporting editor. at the very least a soft block to edit talk pages and non-manespace.Lihaas (talk) 13:42, 2 January 2011 (UTC)Accept reason:Per the below agreement. And damn, three autoblocks?!?! HJMitchell | Penny for your thoughts? 23:10, 2 January 2011 (UTC)Unblocking administrator: Please check for active autoblocks on this user after accepting the unblock request.[edit] Comment by blocking adminI am sorry that this action was necessary. Since 2011 Alexandria bombing is a current event, full protection would not have been a reasonable way to close the 3RR case. It seemed to me that literal enforcement of the WP:3RR rule by blocks was the best plan. It is possible that more users may need to be blocked for the same reason, if warring starts up again. Even though Lihaas' intentions were good, he needs to be sure to stay within the exact limits of 3RR on such a contentious article. I am not as certain of JPosten's good intentions. Your unblock request will remain visible in the queue and it is possible that another admin may take action on it. Thanks, EdJohnston (talk) 19:06, 2 January 2011 (UTC)Someone on IRC said to ask you because you were the blocking admin. I also already stated on the article that i would in fact stay away from the article for some time and told the reporting editor to add back his content.A warning would have sufficed at that point, but at least a soft block to edit tal;k pages?(Lihaas (talk) 19:25, 2 January 2011 (UTC)).Since the blocking admin accepts that you were acting in good faith, I'll make you an offer: I'll unblock you on the sole condition that you don't edit that article (except to revert blatant vandalism if necessary) for what would be the remainder of your block. You can still contribute to the talk page.

NW (Talk) 05:02, 7 January 2011 (UTC)Lihaas, while I do apologize for dragging you into this, O Fenian was out of control, and dictatorial to the point that it was no possible to deal with him. I hope that arbcom will assist in finding a good conclusion to this issue, and thank you for your participation. Trelane (talk) 05:57, 7 January 2011 (UTC)[edit] tunisia protestsas someone who seems to be following: at what point would be safe to assume that the "uprising" has subsided? overthrow? or some sort of suppression? (even if jsut in the itnerim,. ie - kyrgzstan)(Lihaas (talk) 16:35, 5 January 2011 (UTC)).Hey Lihaas - Sorry for the delay in replying and I apologise if this is not the correct way to go about a reply (this is the first time I've used discussion on Wikipedia). Well I've thought about this a fair amount and most days checked Twitter feeds to see the level of activity and what's being said and I actually don't think these are subsiding. I think that actually news is coming out of the country VERY slowly because the government is controlling information very well. But we see today a general strike by almost all lawyers, and apparently teachers have joined now. We hear rumours of protest every day in various towns and cities. I think the fact that people are primarily unemployed who are demonstrating is the key factor here. In Ukraine for example you might expect people to lose interest without significant developments because they had jobs to go to. These people don't. They sadly have all the time in the world to come out on to the streets to demonstrate and the fact that they continue to do so despite; the firing of bullets, the media censorship and the fact the world seems disinterested is telling. This is going to end somehow in a dramatic event of some kind I would imagine. I don't think it will peeter out. Clearly the 'regime' is staying united at the moment but there is a chance someone might see their 'chance' I suppose and we could see a palace coup like that which brought Ben Ali to power. The police seem quite loyal so it's hard to imagine an overthrow by 'the people' and these protests lack a 'leader'. Anyway I could chat endlessly about this but to conclude I think it's safe to say these are very much ongoing and if there is a lull of perhaps a week we could say they were over. All the best, Matty J 87 08/01/2010  Preceding unsigned comment added by Matty J 87 (talk  contribs) 00:08, 8 January 2011 (UTC)Hello again. If you look through the LA Times article you will find it briefly mentions the teachers situation. If there is a better article then please feel free to include it though. Getting back to the story I think with Kyrgyzstan there were a few 'bangs' so to speak - Bakiyev fleeing the capital, then finally leaving the country, Otunbayeva installing herself as President, and then the referendum that approved this measure. These Tunisian protests haven't actually changed anything significant yet. If they're ongoing even if it is for months or years then the article has to just keep on being updated (see the Thai Red Shirt protests). If Ben Ali were to resign, or the police cracked down massively (I don't think there is anyway to force the lawyers on strike back to work now - this presents a headache for Ben Ali, he will surely have to negotiate something with them e.g. TV air time, an investigation, his resignation, a new Prime Minister or Cabinet...who knows) then that would conclude this story. As for the Algeria protests...there could perhaps be a second article (see how the Colour Revolutions page sums up Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Lebanon together) but keeping seperate articles too for the two seperate stories. I don't see these as linked other than Algerian resentment may have been encouraged by Tunisia's but I don't think the outcomes will be the same.
