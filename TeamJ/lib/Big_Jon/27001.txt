Am I too old to get life insurance?  A. You can get competitive quotes for life insurance   coverage up to age 75 and beyond. These cases require special handling.  Cost  Q. Can a $100,000 ten-year level term policy cost less than a $25,000   or $50,000 five-year level term policy?  A. There are more term policies available at $100,000 than   $25,000 or $50,000, because many life insurance companies have minimum issues of   $100,000 of death benefit. This means more competition, which often translates   into lower premiums on $100,000 term policies than $25,000 or $50,000 term   policies. Also, life insurance companies recognize a trend in consumer demand   towards longer duration level term policies. To remain competitive, most   companies have continued to lower the rates on longer duration level term   products, often ignoring annual renewable and five-year level term products.    Q. Are there significant discounts available to people in better than   average health?  A. Most life insurance companies now offer a preferred plus   class, for the person in better than average health. The preferred plus class is   more difficult to qualify for than the regular preferred, only about 15% to 20%   applying qualify for these rates.  Q. Can life insurance premiums be tax deductible?  A. If you are an owner and employee of a corporation, you   may be eligible to participate in certain kinds of employee benefit plans that   offer tax deductions for life insurance benefits.  Definitions Q. What is life insurance?  A. Life insurance offers a way to replace the loss of income   that occurs when someone dies. It is a contract between you as the insured   person and the company or "carrier" that is providing the insurance. If you die   while the contract is in force, the insurance company pays a specified sum of   money free of income tax to the person or persons you name as beneficiaries.    A good life insurance program does more than just replace the loss of income   that occurs if you die. It should also provide money to cover the new costs that   arise after your death. And these cash benefits should provide for your family's   future needs as well, including college education for your children or part of   all of your spouse's retirement needs. In almost all cases, your beneficiary can   use the cash benefits in the way he or she sees fit, without restriction.  Q. What is term insurance?  A. Term insurance provides protection for a specified period   of time: a term of 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 years is available. The type of policy   only pays a benefit if you die during the policy term. Term insurance does not   build cash value. If you stop paying your premium, the insurance expires. This   insurance generally is less expensive than other types of life insurance.  Q. Which plan is right for me?  A. Currently, insurance companies' offerings include level   payment 5, 10, 15 and 20-year term prices. The 5-year and 10-year policies are   best for people who want to keep their policies for no more than 10 years.   Usually, if you feel that your need is at least 5 years, you may best be served   a 10-year policy because the cost will be substantially less than the 5-year   amount when looked at on a cumulative basis. There are extenuating circumstances   and unique situations that arise with some applicants. The 15-year and 20-year   policies are very well priced. A brief evaluation of the figures with respect to   your personal family situation will quickly reveal which alternatives are best.   This is something that you could benefit from a brief discussion with an expert.    Q. What does convertibility mean?  A. You are guaranteed the right to convert your term   insurance policy to permanent insurance without evidence of insurability.  Q. What are some key insurance terms I should know?  A. Key Terms:  Outlay: The actual cash payment you make to the     insurance company each year.       Net cost: Your total payments for a policy less any     cash value in your policy, the profit is less if you cancelled the policy at a     given date.       Riders: These are added benefits that can be purchased     on a policy. Some popular riders allow for investing excess cash in a policy,     or providing a waiver of premiums if you become totally disabled, or to pay     additional benefits of you die of accidental causes or providing low cost     benefits for a spouse and/or children.       Long-term care benefits: A special rider offered by     some companies will pay long-term or catastrophic health care benefits as a     supplemental benefit. These are called living benefit or care riders.       Re-entry: On many term plans the company will grant a     significant discount on future premiums if you agree to take a new medical     exam. Of course, the discount is only available if you pass the exam.       A rated policy: This may be the result of having an     adverse health history, or may be due to occupation, or hazardous activities.     In the event an applicant is offered coverage at a higher rate due to     unfavorable information, consumer laws in most states provide the consumer or     his physician certain rights of access to this information.       Smoker status: Insurers will give a lower premium rate     to buyers who do not smoke or use tobacco. If you smoked in the past, most     carriers will consider you a non-smoker if you have not smoked for one year     prior to applying for coverage. Consumers should be aware that nicotine can be     detected in a variety of routine screening tests that are now commonly     required by most insurance companies.       Insurance company ratings: There are five major     insurance industry rating services: A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's, Moody's,     Duff & Phelps, and Weiss. These services provide information on insurance     company financial performances, stability, claims paying ability, and more.     The top ratings are: A.M. Best =                                                       A++, Standard & Poor's =                                                         AAA, Moody's =                                                                                                                               AAA, Duff & Phelps     = AAA, Weiss = A+.  Health Q. If I had heart bypass surgery one year ago, am I able to buy life   insurance today?  A.

One of our representatives will contact you to arrange completion   of all required insurance company forms. If a medical exam is needed, the   representative will arrange it at a time and place that is convenient for you.   We will handle all the details to obtain your coverage as quickly as possible.   Once you have been approved, your policy will be delivered to you for   inspection. State consumer laws require a "free-look" period. If you change your   mind, you may return your policy and receive a full refund from the insurance   company within a specified period of time.  Q. What can term insurance do for me?  A. Many experts embrace the idea that you should "buy term   and invest the rest." Buying a term policy may allow you to secure the coverage   you need, while giving you the latitude to invest the amount saved over the cost   of permanent insurance in potentially higher-yielding vehicles, such as stocks   and bonds.  Q. What happens when my term is over?  A. If your policy is renewable beyond the guarantee period,   it will contain a provision for what your maximum renewable premium will be. In   many policies there is also an illustrated premium, which is what the insurance   company "projects" the future premium to be (this is lower than the guaranteed   maximum premium). The projected renewal premium is not guaranteed and can be   higher or lower than what is shown but never higher than the guaranteed maximum   premium.  Q. Can I have more than one policy?  A. Yes. You can have a permanent life insurance policy and   add a supplemental term life policy for a short-term need, for example. If you   request more insurance coverage than your expenses indicate you need, the   insurance company will want proof that a medical condition is not motivating   your request.  Q. What if my policy lapses?  A. If a policy lapses, most companies allow you a grace   period in which to pay your premium and continue the policy. If you have enough   cash value built up in your policy, most companies will use part of the cash   values to pay the premium due. If you have a term policy and don't pay within   the grace period, your policy will lapse and simply end.  Needs Q. Do I need life insurance?  A. Life insurance is a unique asset that is a valuable   addition to your overall estate due to its potentially high yield and   tax-favored benefits. Life insurance can be used for any number of reasons. Some   of the most common uses are:   Creating an estate where time or other circumstances     have kept the estate owner from accumulating sufficient assets to care for his     or her loved ones. Life insurance can create an instant estate.       Paying estate taxes and other estate settlement costs.     These costs can vary from a low percentage of 3% to 4% percent to over 50% of     the estate. Federal estate taxes are due nine months after death.       Funding a business transfer. Business owners often     agree to buy a deceased owner's share from his or her estate after death. Life     insurance provides the ready cash to finance the transaction.       Funding college for children or grandchildren. Cash     value increases, in a policy on a minor's life or the parent's life, can be     used to accumulate funds for college.       Paying off the home mortgage. Many people would like     to pass the family residence to their spouse or children free of any mortgage.     Often a decreasing term policy is used, which decreases in face amount as the     mortgage balance is paid down.       Protecting a business from the loss of a key employee.     Key employees are difficult to attract and retain. Their untimely death may     cause a severe financial strain on the business.       Creating a retirement fund. Current insurance products     provide competitive returns and are a prudent way of accumulating necessary     funds for retirement years.       Replacing a charitable gift. Charitable remainder     trusts provide tax benefits and life insurance can replace the value of the     donated asset. Policies can also be paid directly to a charity.       Guaranteeing loans. Personal or business loans can be     paid off with insurance proceeds.       Equalizing inheritances. When the family business passes to children who     are active in it, life insurance can give an equal amount to the other     children.  Q. How much life insurance do I need?  A. Generally speaking, the amount of life insurance that an   individual should consider purchasing should be between six and eight times his   or her annual earnings. However, there are many factors that should be taken   into account when calculating this figure. For example, income sources and   amounts other than salary earnings, whether or not the individual is married   and, if so, what the spouse's earning capacity amounts to, the number of   individuals who are financially dependent on the insured, the amount of death   benefits payable from Social Security and from an employer-sponsored life   insurance plan, whether any special life insurance needs exist, and so on, are   some things to be considered in determining a more precise estimate.  Q. What about purchasing life insurance on my children?  A. You can either buy a separate policy for your child(ren)   or purchase a child rider that will allow you to cover your child(ren) on your   policy. The availability and acceptance of children as a rider varies by   company. When you request an application you can indicate your desire for such   coverage and we will advise you as to the availability and/or exclusions and   cost.  Q. How much life insurance should the mother of one infant   have?  A. My husband and I both work. There are a number of things   to consider when calculating the amount of insurance that any given individual   should own. Opinions differ as to exactly how to calculate the appropriate   amount of life insurance. Be wary of rules of thumb advice such as multiplying   your current earnings by eight because they tend to be misleading, these quick   solutions oftentimes do not take important factors such as age and future   earning potential into consideration (factors which, when improperly calculated,   can produce dramatically different estimates). There are a number of life   insurance calculators on the Internet that can more accurately guide you to a   figure that would fulfill your insurance needs. Naturally, these calculators   take certain factors into consideration, but the actuaries and other financial   analysts who create these tools are cognizant of prevailing investment/financial   strategies. Typically, however, when you attempt to calculate the amount of   insurance that is right for you, there are a few basic things to take into   consideration:  Life insurance is intended to secure your family's financial security in the   event of your death. Unfortunately few people realize exactly what their   individual contributions to their families actually are. In your case,   calculating your contribution to your family's net earnings is complicated by   the fact that you are the mother of an infant. Aside from the loss of your   income, your husband would incur additional costs in raising your child as a   single parent. Furthermore, if your family currently holds health insurance   through your employer, the loss of those benefits would incur additional health   care costs for your survivors. Finally, saving for your child's future college   education would become increasingly difficult with only one source of income.   The amount of insurance you choose to purchase should reflect the contribution   of your salary to your family's adjusted standard of living, and this figure is   impacted by your current age and your future earning potential. The primary goal   of insurance is to replace this loss of income.  Perhaps a term life insurance policy is your best option. One major benefit   of term insurance is its low price. Most individuals can actually afford to   adequately insure themselves because term insurance is so inexpensive. Term   insurance can also be an attractive alternative if you decide that you only   require life insurance coverage through a certain point in your life, e.g., when   your child graduates from college.  Whatever standard of living that you intend to provide for your child during   your lifetime should be taken into consideration when calculating the amount of   life insurance you purchase. Term coverage can allow you the flexibility to save   and invest, and the potential for securing adequate coverage for the time when   you need it most.  Purchase Q. What happens after I request an application? How   long will the process take?  A. Application: An application will be mailed to you for   your review and/or completion and signature (if for some reason we cannot   facilitate your application you will be notified immediately). We will provide   you with a postage-paid envelope in which to return your completed application.    Medical Exam: You will be contacted to set a time for a medical exam. The   exam normally takes place at your home but can also be scheduled at the   examiner's office or your work. The exam takes about 30 minutes and generally   consists of a height and weight measurement, blood pressure reading and blood   and urine sample. If you request, results of the exam will be provided to you.    Underwriting: After your application and medical results are received by the   insurance company, underwriting will begin. Underwriting is the term used to   describe the process the insurance company undertakes to determine whether or   not you are approved for coverage. During this process, the company will review   additional information and/or request medical records from your doctor. The   normal underwriting time is 4-8 weeks.  Decision: After your exam results and application are reviewed by the   insurance company, it will notify you as to whether or not you were approved for   coverage. There are three scenarios that can occur at the decision stage:   Your application is approved at the same rate class as     was requested. In this case your policy will automatically be mailed to you.       Your application is approved at a higher rate than     what was quoted. For example, you applied for Preferred but your cholesterol     was elevated on the health exam and the insurance company approves you at     Standard. In this case we will notify you that your application was approved     at a higher rate and ask whether or not you are still interested in coverage.     If you are, your policy will be mailed.       Your application for coverage is denied. If your application is approved     at a higher rate than you applied or if your application was denied, you will     be provided the reason(s).  Coverage: Once you receive your policy, satisfy any outstanding requirements,   and pay your first premium (if you did not elect temporary coverage if it was   available), your policy will go into effect and your coverage will begin!  Q. How can I help expedite the process?  A. The most time-consuming portion of the application   process involves the satisfaction of medical requirements. Medical requirements   vary by insurance company, by applicant age, and by amount of insurance   purchased. The insurance company needs all the required information before the   underwriting process can begin. Whether it is the completion of a brief   paramedical exam or requiring medical information from your doctor, your   assistance in ensuring that these requirements are satisfied will dramatically   affect the processing of your application.  Q. Do I have to send money with my application?  A. No. We do not require you to send money with the   application. However, many companies will provide you with limited temporary   coverage while your application is being reviewed if you remit the first premium   payment with your application. In some instances, temporary coverage is not   allowed. When you request an application, we will notify you if temporary   coverage is an option.  Q. What does the medical exam entail?  A. For individual life purchases, you will be classified   based on height, weight, nicotine use, and other health factors. Your health   status will determine what rate class category you fit in, so even if you have   some health problems, you could be covered. There is no public list of factors   available; however, your agent should explain what criteria determine the class   into which you fall.  Q. How do I check on the status of my application?  A. To check on the status of your application, call us and   speak to one of our trained experts.  Q. How can I pay for my life insurance?  A. You can pay your premiums annually, semiannually,   quarterly, or in monthly payments. Many companies also allow you to have your   premium automatically deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit   card.  Rating Q. What do the A.M. Best insurance company ratings mean?  A. A.M. Best is perhaps the oldest and most recognized   company rating life insurance companies for financial strength and solvency.   Companies rated A++ and A+ are considered "Superior" companies and companies   rated A and A- are considered "Excellent" companies.  Smoking Q. If I quit smoking, how long do I have to wait to get   nonsmoker rates?  A. The length of time varies, but with most life insurance   companies you would have to quit smoking for 12 to 24 months to be considered   for nonsmoker rates. There can be as much as a 30% to 50% savings going from   smoker to nonsmoker rates.  Q. Can cigar or pipe smokers get nonsmoker rates?  A. Most life insurance companies consider cigar or pipe   smoking the same as cigarette smoking, with premium rates 30% to 50% higher than   nonsmoker rates. A few of the top-rated life insurance companies disagree,   offering nonsmoker rates to cigar or pipe smokers.  Q. What are the general guidelines that determine preferred nonsmoker   rates?  A. There are several criteria:   No tobacco usage of any kind in the last 3 years       No history of, or current treatment for, high blood     pressure, cancer, diabetes, mental or nervous disorders, or disorders of the     heart, lungs, liver, or kidneys       No incidence, prior to age 60, of cardiovascular     disease in immediate family (parents, siblings)       All values should be favorable, including cholesterol,     triglycerides, and lipids       No abnormal findings in urinalysis; presence of     nicotine may disqualify you for preferred class       Height and weight must comply with established     underwriting guidelines       No convictions for reckless driving or driving under     the influence of alcohol or drugs in the past 5 years       No participation in hazardous activities or avocations     that require rating       Private pilots may be preferred but may have flat     extra premium or exclusion       No residence outside U.S. or Canada INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMERThe information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.
