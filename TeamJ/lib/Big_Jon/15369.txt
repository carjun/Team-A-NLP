Will China become a military superpower stealth?     Beijing :  China|Jan 07, 2011By karasiwo        2 0     Views: 309       Images that are created the new generation of China's air force have been circulating around the internet, but Pentagon officials insist that this does not mean that China has caught up with the U.S. Air Force. It is assumed that China's new stealth aircraft, known as the J-20, will run until 2017. However, in 2009, an air force commander told the TV China in your country that flight tests could begin much earlier. Stealth aircraft like the F-22 U.S., are designed to avoid detection by radar and air defenses. Now, unknown sources published photographs of what appears to be the plane on a runway in Southwest China. "We are aware of their plans to develop this plane fifth generation fighter, said Wednesday the Pentagon spokesman, Col. Dave Lapan. "The photographs were recently published are presumably some evidence of landing." In a briefing Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, refused to comment on the reports of aircraft testing. "China insists on peaceful development path," he said. "We have adopted a national defense policy defensive in nature and not a threat to other countries. China has been an important force to maintain peace in the region and the world." The appearance of the photographs happen when the defense secretary, Robert Gates, traveling to China this weekend to discuss military relations between both nations. And later this month, President Hu Jintao will travel to Washington for a summit with President Barack ObamaBarack Obama. An observer from China said that Beijing's failure to censor the net grainy images are proof that the photos are of the new aircraft and that the country wants to circulate. "The Chinese army and the police could have surrounded the area of the runway easily, but what they did is that controlled this. They allowed the Chinese only take pictures with cell phones, which means they have low resolution, we do not give great detail about the aircraft and climbed into the network at a low resolution format, "said Chinese military expert and author, Richard Fisher. "The response in China has been extremely positive and has encouraged national pride in a great degree." The Pentagon is taking a low profile approach to the emergence of advertising the Chinese fighter jet, saying that its current modern war plane has engine problems and that its next spacecraft is years away from being produced. But Fisher said that the timetable could be accelerated if the Chinese buy an engine to Russia instead of developing them themselves. "It is something that is in a stage of development, such as fighter of the fifth generation. As I said, the Chinese still have problems with their aircraft fourth generation fighter," Lapan said in a session with reporters questions outside of camera his office. He said that while the new plane is not mentioned in the Pentagon report on China that was sent to Congress in August as an annual update on China's defense capabilities, the Department of Defense has talked about it. "We as a department in the past have spoken publicly about it. It's not as if we had no knowledge that they are looking for a fighter of the fifth generation," said Lapan. "As far as we are aware of it. But not to worry they are working on a plane fifth generation fighter."  However, Fisher said he could be a concern, citing the potential of the Chinese plane to overtake the U.S. F-22 in thrust and speed "supercruise", which is the ability to fly at supersonic without using high fuel consumption. "We can not say precisely the capabilities you have, but we have a good idea. Right now, we should be reviving the production of the F-22, and not just resuming production, we should be developing an advanced version of F-22," said Fisher. "Unfortunately, although it is a complicated program, the F-35 and needs an update. There needs to be competitive with that plane." In 2009, reduced the F-22 production. Production of the F-35, which is in a state of development and testing can be stopped under the reduction initiative Gates budget. That year, Gates said that no nation is about the U.S. air force, and predicted that the Chinese had only a "handful" of fighters that could challenge the U.S. fleet advanced in 2025. But Fisher's warnings that this plane could be the cause of a change in the balance of power in the Pacific. "Since the Second World War, the U.S. military has not gone to war without air superiority security. China is a rising power, is determined to challenge the U.S. global position," said Fisher. "This will enable fighter aircraft to a military level it ... and from my point of view, this is simply unacceptable."        1 of 4         Will China become a military superpower stealth.      karasiwo is based in Karchi, Sind, Pakistan,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (56.3%) Senegal (10.1%) India (5.7%) Canada (4.7%) 18 other countries (20.1%)           READ MORE: l China, military, SuperPower, stealth, Russia, USA, Japan, UK, Australia, world, supper power, F-35 Lightning II, U.S. Air Force, Supercruise, Fisher, fighter aircraft, fifth generation, Fourth-generation jet fighter, Pentagon, Post-PFI Soviet/Russian aircraft projects, generation fighters, aircraft, Dave Lapan, Stealth aircraft, odd-news, jet aircraft, Barack Obama, China, Hu Jintao, Beijing, Aviation, Southwest China, Hong Lei, F-22 Raptor, Richard Fisher, Robert Gates   More News From: Beijing :  China     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 2            Reply  Posted By     Gino C.
