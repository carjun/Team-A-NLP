(Jeff Stone)Those of us who wish to save the Torrey Pine tree at 4633 Long Branch Avenue in Ocean Beach won a small battle at the last OB Planning Board meeting, Wednesday, December 1st.We won a temporary reprieve from the Board  as the City has been threatening to chop down the tree within the next thirty days. The Board voted unanimously to give the parties thirty days to do testing and evaluations, develop alternatives to removal, and to return to the Board with their results.A battle was won  yet the war may still be lost.The majestic tree on the 4600 block of Long Branch dominates that entire block  I know as I lived on that very block for over five years until just recently . It  along with at least one other Torrey Pine on private property  gives that block a special feeling and look. The foliage from the tree spreads out  up and across the street until a virtual canopy of pine is formed for that part of the block. Its shady and cooler during the summers.That block of Long Branch   has always been one of the most green blocks in OB, a block with a bounty of trees and bushes. Ive noticed that since the early Seventies.  Of course, over time, a number of the trees have been removed, and the block is not as green as it once was.But as you drive down the block or happen upon it  you cant get away from the visuals of towering dark green pine and the effect it has.Now imagine all that  gone.  Its overpowering  the change would be so drastic  as to effectively disfigure the block  making it a lot less welcoming  more sterile  more gentrified.The City may very well still take the tree out. Its experts say that, their contractor says that. Dont they? Thats what Drew Potocki said during the Planning Board meeting.But if you dig a little (no pun intended) into what little documentation the City has provided for their case against the tree, you can find fault in Potockis logic. For example, two of the Citys experts say that the adjacent sidewalk needs repair  and no one disagrees with that. It is broken and the root has cracked it. It has never been permanently repaired.So the experts say, well, if you repair the sidewalk, youll cut the roots of the tree, thus make it weaker and more dangerous  so  this logic goes  it must be removed. No ifs and or buts.Yet  over on the 4600 block of Saratoga Avenue  3 blocks away  the City has done great things with the sidewalks to save the Torrey Pine trees there. Why cant the City do something like that on Long Branch? The City has not even addressed this. Why not? It was their work on Saratoga.So, theres questions like these that need to be addressed before anything is done to the Long Branch Torrey Pine. So, please pardon the following details, but come along for a journey into the fight to save just one Torrey Pine, and allow me to share and spell out the issues here and gather some recent history and post it all together.Torrey Pine in Del Mar, north of the Torrey Pine park. Photo by Monique Bowen.Torrey Pine TreesThe Torrey Pine tree (pinus torreyana) is one of the rarest pine trees in America and even the world. Whether it is the very rarest in the U.S. is up for contention. Right now, there are only two locations where it grows in the wild: Santa Rosa Island in the Channel Islands 175 miles off the coast of Southern California and in Del Mar, up the coast from OB. Todays large Torrey Pine trees in Ocean Beach were all planted back in the Thirties.Its estimated that there are only 2,000  3,000 Torrey Pine trees remaining that are growing in the wild. Its also believed that the Torrey Pine was the one dominant tree species of Southern California, its forests blanketed the area. But by time the Europeans arrived, there was only the two basic locations. The trees were very important to local Indians. According to Pat Welshs Southern California Organic Gardening:The wild groves of these trees still in existence were once part of a  much larger forest that, probably due to climate changes, shrank to the  limited area we know today. In the 16th century these trees served as a  prominent landmark to seafaring Spaniards on an otherwise bare coast.  They gave the name Punta Des Arboles, the Point of the Trees, to the  current location of Torrey Pines State Reserve. Called Soledad Pine by the Spaniards, the species was renamed in 1850  by Dr. Charles Christopher Parry, a traveling botanist [part of the US-Mexico Border Survey party] in honor of his  friend, Dr. John Torrey, the greatest botanist of his time.For centuries before the arrival of Europeans, the Torrey pine was an  important source of  food and craft materials for local Kumeyaay Native  Americans. In fall they gathered the nutritious nuts off the ground.  They used the sap to make glue and sealant and the needles for coiled  baskets.By the time San Diego was settled, there were only several groves of the trees left up in Del Mar. Local philanthropist and newspaper publisher Ellen Browning Scripps bought the grove of trees south of the Penasquitos Lagoon to protect them and their native area, and with her foresight and generosity donated the core grove that eventually became what is today the Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve.Among trees, pine trees in general are the longest living trees in the wild. And among pine trees, Torrey Pines have some of the most longevity. It takes most species of pine trees two years for their pine cones to mature; for Torrey Pines, it takes three years. And according to experts, Torrey Pines in the wild live 200 years.The roots of Torrey Pines can spread out far beyond the length of its branches; a forty foot tree can have 2 to 3 times that length in roots. In the wild, they are known for their deep roots and wind-blown shapes.The Torrey Pine is an endangered species. An endangered species is one that is at risk of being extinct.Coastal communities that are fortunate to have Torrey Pines in their  midst treasure them for their unique history. Within the City of Del  Mar, the Torrey Pine is protected by law, having become their heritage  tree. And in Ocean Beach a few years ago, strenuous efforts were made  to protect the strand of Torrey Pines on the 4600 block of Saratoga  Avenue. Buckled sidewalks were removed and re-poured to fit around the  trees and metal grates were put in place to be able to move when the  earth and trees grow. Under citizen pressure, the City of San Diego did this.San Diego in general honors the Torrey Pines, and has named the following sites after them: Torrey Pines State Natural Preserve, Torrey Pines Golf Course, Torrey Pines Gliderport, among others.Trail map of Torrey Pine State Natural PreserveSome History in the Protection of San Diego Torrey PinesAt the time of their naming, Torrey Pines were thought to only be in one locale, the Del Mar area. Dr Parry  the botanist who had named the Torrey Pine, returned to the area in 1883. He was shocked at the lack of protection for the main groves of wild Torrey Pines in the Del Mar area, and wrote to the San Diego Society of Natural History an historical and scientific account of the tree, emphasizing the need to protect it from extermination. That resulted in some movement towards guarding their groves. The State Preserves website states:The first source of protection came in 1885 from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. They posted signs citing a reward of $100 for the apprehension of anyone vandalizing a Torrey pine tree.In 1888 the grove of trees on Santa Rosa Island was discovered. That added to a mystery about the trees and the growing momentum for some kind of protection. Plus California formed a State Board of Forestry that same year. However, there was apparently a set-back two years later, when pueblo lands that included the Torrey Pines area were leased for cattle and sheep grazing, and trees were cut and used for firewood.First Park for Torrey Pines EstablishedFinally in 1899 the San Diego City Council voted to set aside 364 acres as a public park  this was the very first park of Torrey Pine trees, but unfortunately it did not include specifics to protect the Torrey Pines themselves.After the turn of the century, the lands surrounding the park were in danger of being commercially sold. Between 1908 and 1911, newspaper woman and philanthropist, Ellen Browning Scripps, acquired two additional pueblo lots and willed them to the people of San Diego. This added to the park the area of North Grove and the estuary. Botanical studies of the park by San Diego Society of Natural History were conducted in 1916, and their findings of damage caused by people picnicking and camping reignited the public movement for the trees preservation. In 1921, the first custodian of the park was named  Guy Fleming (today theres a trail named after him). The next year, Scripps had a well-known landscape architect map out a long-term plan for the park. And by 1923, the Lodge was built. The City Council added more pueblo lands the next year, and the park gradually grew through the years  but not before other threats to the Torrey Pines.Between 1928 and 1930, the League To Save Torrey Pines fought and won against a proposed cliff road above the beach. The purpose of the road was to eliminate curves and grades in the old road. The opponents felt that the road would not only destroy a section of the park but would also be costly to build. One of the reasons the League was so against this new road was that it called for using landfill in the canyons so that the road could go across them.Another threat occurred during World War II when the Army leased leased 750 acres of Torrey Pines Mesa from the City for training purposes including anti-aircraft artillery.Up to the late Fifties, the Torrey Pines park was under the authority of the San Diego Department of Parks & Recreation. Citizens and government managers did not believe the City had sufficient authority to protect the endangered species within it, so in 1956 a special city election was held which resulted in handing the nearly 1,000 acre park to the State of California, for it to become a state reserve.About 100 acres were appropriated for the construction of a public golf course. The State Park became official in 1959.  In 2007 the nomenclature was changed to Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve.Meanwhile in Ocean Beach One of the projects of the WPA (Works Progress Administration) during the early Thirties of the Great Depression, was planting young Torrey Pine trees from out of one foot high-gallon cans on both sides of Catalina Boulevard, from the old gate to Cabrillo national monument. The Torrey Pine trees for the project were raised in Ocean Beach by David Cobb, a County employee who had some land on Saratoga Avenue for a nursery. Pine nuts from the Torrey Pines park were gathered and seeds were sprouted and they were transplanted to larger and larger cans, a process that took one to two years.The original project on top of Point Loma failed due to there not being sufficient protection of the trees roots from gophers, squirrels and rabbits,  although a few survivors can be found near the Fire Station on Catalina.Back in Ocean Beach, the Cobbs ended up with extra trees and they were planted along Saratoga Avenue and a few other blocks as well.__________Since the subject of trimming or pruning the Long Branch Avenue tree has been raised, here are some points in pruning Torrey Pines from Pat Welsh:Points in the Pruning of Torrey PinesIf a Torrey pine tree is in good health and does not have any dead growth in it, it may never need pruning.All pruning should be done in winter months between the beginning of November and the end of February before warm weather promotes extensive new growth of shoots and foliage.All cuts should be made at the outside edge of branch collars. (The branch collar is the thickened area or ridge that surrounds a branch where it meets the trunk or another larger branch.)]Any lowering of height or shortening of branches needs to be accomplished by drop-crotching. (Drop-crotching is a system of pruning by which a new leader is chosen farther down on the tree or further back on a branch.)Never allow a tree to be topped and never allow branches to be chopped off without leaving a remaining growth tip. (Topping is a discredited pruning system by which a trees height is lowered by cutting straight through branches or the trunk removing all tip growth further out or up from the cut. Above all, when pruning, never remove more than twenty percent of the foliage of a Torrey pine tree at any one time. Pines need a healthy canopy of foliage to provide food for their root system.Over-pruning combined with incorrectly placed cuts weakens trees and can stimulate excessive growth on remaining branches.More on our own Torrey Pine on Long Branch in Part Two.References:-Elizabeth Santos masters thesis , as quoted in Torreyana, 2008.- Pat Welshs Southern California Organic Gardening- Torrey Pines State Natural Preserve websiteShare|Did you find this article interesting?

Our city must stop wasting our tax dollars and get serious about infastructure needs and maintenance of roads, buildings, parks, trees etc.  Taking care of what we have BEFORE building anything new should be a priority.  Our government should lead an example not be an exception.On another note, does any one work with photo shop to show us what the street would look like without this Torrey Pine?  Great articleThanks.ReplyDianneDecember 4, 2010 at 11:42 amReport/observation from a tree-hugger:Today when I drove by to look at the tree again, the man who lives in the house across from the tree was in the street talking with a man (gray hair, glasses) who is on the OB Planning Board and was at that meeting last Wednesday.  The homeowner said that about two years ago a Torrey Pine fell on a house on that block.  Does anyone know anything about that?   Is it true?  If so, what were the circumstances?  Was it really a Torrey Pine?  Was it diseased?Thank you for all the photos of leaning Torrey Pines around San Diego.  Every new bit of information is an eye-opener.  I do think the  energy and the focus should be on the safety, rather than the beauty and the specialness.  No matter how wonderful and significant, IF the tree is a danger, we do not want anyone/anything to be hurt/damaged.ReplyFrank GormlieDecember 4, 2010 at 12:08 pmI lived on that block for over 5 years. No, no Torrey Pine has fallen on that block this century.  There was a Torrey Pine in a neighbors back yard that was trimmed but it never fell.  There was a diseased and near-dead tree removed on that block closer to Ebers, but it was a smallish tree and NOT a Torrey Pine. We are emphasizing the safety issue by showing that these types of trees do grow at a slant.  Our experts are saying this Torrey Pine is very healthy.  This tree is not a danger, but well let our experts tell you that in upcoming reports and evaluations.ReplyWireless MikeDecember 4, 2010 at 12:06 pmThe San Diego Municipal Code protects Torrey Pine trees as follows:63.07 Destruction, Injury of Torrey Pines Trees  ProhibitedThat it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to cut, injure or destroy any treesknown as the Pinus Torreyana growing upon Pueblo Lots Nos. 1332, 1337 and1338 or any other public lots or lands, belonging to and within the corporate limits ofthe City of San Diego.Obviously, cases will arise when a Torrey Pine tree must be pruned or removed, which would violate 63.07. In such a case, who has the legal authority to declare an exception to 63.07? Would that legal authority belong to the Urban Forester, the local Planning Board, the City Council, the Mayor, a judge, or someone else? Or is it an undefined loophole in the Municipal Code? It is unclear to me exactly who has been granted the legal authority to make that decision.ReplyFrank GormlieDecember 4, 2010 at 12:11 pmThere is also, Wireless, a city ordinance that states that city employees may act when there are dangerous conditions to mitigate the dangers and hazards.ReplySunshineDecember 4, 2010 at 1:11 pmomg, do not leave the issue of danger in the sole judgement of one person.ReplySethDecember 4, 2010 at 1:40 pmIm on the OBPB, and cant speak for them or even really o-pine on this is much detail, but there are a few facts and pieces of info mentioned at that public meeting that readers here should probably be aware of. 1. Saratoga is a much wider street than Long Branch, and what was done with the sidewalks there next may not be possible without going into the front yard of the homeowner adjacent to the Long Branch tree. 2. At least one homeowner on that block feels the slant of the tree has increased in the past year or so, although that has not really been quantified. 3. There is a pregnant woman who lives directly across the street from the tree. Anything beyond that, I cant really speak to until more information becomes available. I do hope there is a way to retain the tree safely, though.ReplySarahDecember 4, 2010 at 1:43 pmI gotta know why the reproductive status of the woman across the street from the tree is in any way relevant to the removal (or rescue) of a tree.ReplyOB DudeDecember 4, 2010 at 3:16 pmHmmI gotta know what effect the tree has on the pregnant women or what effect the pregnant woman has on the tree.  Now the dialogue gets even more interesting.Does our community plan or updated community plan have info in it on trees.number of, types, potential problems, future tree planting, history etc.?ReplySethDecember 4, 2010 at 3:28 pmSarah, without any opinion of my own offered, I can inform that one of the major topics of discussion at the meeting was the level of public safety risk posed by the tree. The tree is 80 years old, and a googling would show many lifespan estimates for Torrey Pines being 100 years (some ranges may go as high at 150 years). I certainly invite anyone to go look at the tree, read any of the reports being presented and ask themselves what level of risk does or does not exist, whether or not there are any particular properties that might be at higher risk than others, what the possible outcomes of any risk might be, what possible risk mitigation strategies actually exist and ask themselves who among us is entitled to decide what an acceptable risk is for others? My reporting the reproductive status of a neighbor was not an attempt to position this as tree vs baby, or anything like that. It is just a factual piece of information that you can do with what you please. Speaking for myself, I am interested in getting as much information as possible about this before helping to make any potential non-binding, advisory recommendations to the City on behalf of the community.ReplyCreezeDecember 4, 2010 at 1:50 pmI surly do know now a hell of a lot more than I ever did about Torrey Pine Trees Its like this ONE tree in Ocean Beach is willing to sacrifice its life just so human beings can become more informed about its pine specie  and their fight to remain intact and living  as an integral part of the natural world.ReplyCreezeDecember 4, 2010 at 4:27 pmIf I offended anyone here by using the word hell in my previously posted comment, I humbly apologize. I truly didnt think it would bother anyone or I wouldnt have used it in the first place ! If it DID bother anyone, please let me know along with letting me know if it DIDNT matter to  anyone also Thank You.ReplySarahDecember 6, 2010 at 10:14 ampssst:  I was not offended.ReplyeditordudeDecember 6, 2010 at 9:27 amMichael Chen from Channel 10 News just informed us that they had a lot of viewers follow their piece about this tree.  Channel 10 BTW is the only news station to pick this story up.ReplyWarren A. JacobsDecember 6, 2010 at 3:14 pmI have found this story very interesting. One thing that strikes me:  Ive seen nothing written about anyone involved in the decision having any truly relevant qualifications. Risk can indeed be quantified. A competent arborist can do this. The credential that would indicate  qualification for the job is Certified Tree Risk Assessor . A list of arborists who have this credential can be found on the website of the  Pacific Northwest chapter of  the International Society of Arboriculture.Once risk level  has been determined,  the tree owners  can decide whether or not  its above their risk-tolerance threshhold.ReplyKeith FinkDecember 6, 2010 at 5:33 pmFrank,As far as I can tell, the Torrey pine is not a Federal or State listed endangered or threatened species.If it were a listed species, it would be much more difficult for the city to remove it, but it would also mean the numbers of individual species would be much more reduced (at bit of a catch-22).The California Native Plant Society, however, considers it a rare species which, I believe, does make it a specie of concern.ReplyFrank GormlieDecember 6, 2010 at 6:03 pmAccording to Wikipedia: The Torrey Pine, Pinus torreyana, is the rarest pine species in the United States, an endangered species growing only in San Diego County and on one of the Channel Islands, endemic to the coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion in the U.S. state of California.As its authority it cites : IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
