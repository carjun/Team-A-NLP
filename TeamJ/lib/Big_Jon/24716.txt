On June 21, 2010, in Federal District Court in Manhattan he confessed to 10 counts arising from the bombing attempt. Throughout his court appearance, Shahzad was unrepentant, and the United States attorney indicated there was no plea deal, so Shahzad faced the maximum sentence, a mandatory life term.[10]Shahzad was arrested approximately 53 hours after the attempt,[11] at 11:45 p.m. EDT on May 3, 2010, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers.[12][13] He was taken into custody at John F. Kennedy International Airport, after boarding Emirates Flight 202 to Dubai.[7][14][15] His final destination had been Islamabad, Pakistan.A federal complaint was filed on May 4, alleging that Shahzad committed five terrorism-related crimes, including the attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.[16] Shahzad waived his constitutional right to a speedy hearing.[7][8][12][17]Shahzad has reportedly implicated himself in the crimes, and has given information to authorities since his arrest after receiving Miranda warnings.[12][18] CBS News reported that Shahzad admitted training in bomb-making at a terrorist camp run by a militant Islamist faction in the Waziristan region of Pakistan.[8] As of May 7, Shahzad was continuing to answer questions and provide intelligence to investigators.[17] Over a dozen people were arrested by Pakistani officials in connection with the plot.[citation needed]On October 5, 2010, Shahzad was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to a 10-count indictment in June, including charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting an act of terrorism.[19]Contents1 Background2 Attempted bombing of Times Square2.1 Reported preparations2.2 Arrest and charges2.3 International ties and investigation2.4 Conviction3 See also4 References5 External links[edit] BackgroundShahzad is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He was born in Pakistan in either Kashmir, Karachi, or Pabbi (a village in Nowshera District east of Peshawar).[20][21][22] The village Mohib Banda (near Peshawar) is his ancestral home, which his father left before he was born.[23] Pakistani government officials said to Time that Shahzad is of Kashmiri descent.[1][2] Forbes reported that he is of Pashtun extraction, and The New York Times reported that he identified proudly with his tribal Pashtun heritage.[3][24][25] He is the youngest of four children.Time opined that his family's background in northwestern Pakistan meant that he likely spoke Pashto, a rare asset in the training camps compared to other Western volunteers.[26] Faiz Ahmed, a former mayor in Mohib Banda  his ancestral home  and a close friend of his father, said in this regard in an interview with National Public Radio: "This is a tragedy for me and every Pakistani, every Pashtun."[27] Shahzad comes from a wealthy, well-educated family in northwest Pakistan.[7] His father, Baharul Haq, lives in the Hayatabad suburb of Peshawar.[28] He was a senior official in the Pakistan Air Force, holding the rank of Air Vice-Marshal (the equivalent of a two-star general) before leaving the air force in 1992,[7][29] and is a deputy director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan.[30][31][32] He had begun as a common airman, but became a fighter pilot excelling in aerobatics, and was posted in England and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.[3]Shahzad attended primary school in Saudi Arabia, according to documents found outside his Shelton home, and then attended several schools in Pakistan.[5] In high school, he received Ds in English composition and microeconomics.[3] He then enrolled in Greenwich University, a Karachi business school, where he was a mediocre student.[3] He had servants, chaffeurs, and armed guards.[3] He has a Pakistani identification card issued by the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) stating that he is a resident of Karachi.[7] Kifayat Ali, a man who said he is a cousin of Shahzad's father, insisted that Shahzad's family had no political affiliations, adding that the arrest appeared as a "conspiracy so that the [Americans] can bomb more Pashtuns," and "He was never linked to any political or religious party [in Pakistan]."[33]Shahzad studied for five semesters in 1997 and 1998 at the now-defunct Southeastern University in Washington, D.C., where he took mostly business classes, receiving several Cs and Ds, an F in basic statistics, and a grade point average of 2.78.[34] In December 1998 he was granted an F-1 student visa.[35] In 1999 he was placed on a US Customs (later merged into DHS) travel lookout list called the "Traveler Enforcement Compliance System."[36]In 2000 he transferred to the University of Bridgeport, where more than a third of the students were foreign students.[3] Shahzad's former teachers at the University of Bridgeport said he appeared to be quiet and unremarkable. On weekends, he would go to Bengali-theme nightclubs in New York City. A classmate remembered him watching new footage of the planes hitting the Twin Towers in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and saying: "They had it coming."[3] He received a B.A. in computer applications and information systems,[3][35] with his parents attending his graduation on May 13, 2002.[37] Just before graduation, in April 2002, he was granted an H1-B visa for skilled workers.[35] He remained in the U.S. for three years on that visa, earning an M.B.A at the University of Bridgeport in the summer of 2005.[35]Shahzad worked as a junior financial analyst in the accounting department at the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics company in Stamford, Connecticut, while he was still working on his master's degree from January 2002 and until June 15, 2006, when he resigned to work elsewhere.[37] He complained to his friends during his time working for them that they never raised his salary above $50,000.[3]On December 24, 2004, in an arranged marriage in Peshawar, Pakistan, he married Huma Asif Mian, a Pashtun Colorado-born U.S. citizen who had just graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder with a degree in Accounting.[3][38][39][40][5][41] She and her Pakistani-born parents had lived in Qatar and Colorado; her parents now live in Saudi Arabia.[40] A neighbor recalled Shahzad visited the family only once before she joined him in Connecticut. On her social networking page, Shahzad's wife lists her languages as English, Pashto, Urdu, and French, her religion as Muslim and her political view as "nonpolitical."[33] Her father, Mohammad Asif Mian, is a petroleum engineering expert who has written a number of books and technical manuals, including a best-selling book on Project Economics and Decision Analysis, worked for companies such as Saudi Aramco and Qatar General Petroleum, and has two master's degrees from Colorado School of Mines.[39][42] After Shahzad was arrested, his father-in-law said: "to go to this extreme, this is unbelievable. He has lovely children. Two really lovely children. As a father I would not be able to afford to lose my children."[3]He bought a black Mercedes in 2002, as well as a condominium in Norwalk, Connecticut, for $205,000 which he sold in May 2004 to computer consultant George LaMonica for a $56,000 profit.[3][3] LaMonica was interviewed afterward by investigators from the national Joint Terrorism Task Force, regarding details of the transactions and information about Shahzad.[43]Shahzad was granted a permanent residence status (a "green card") in January 2006.[21] He bought a new single-family three-bedroom home in Shelton, Connecticut, just outside Bridgeport in 2006, at which the family lived.[3][37][44] From mid-June 2006 to June 2009, Shahzad worked as a junior financial analyst, a position he told a friend paid $70,000, for Affinion Group, an affinity marketing and consulting business[45] then located at 100Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut.[37]He was granted U.S. citizenship on April 17, 2009, due to his marriage to his wife.[7][41] A few weeks later, he abruptly quit his job and stopped making payments on his house, defaulting on the $218,400 mortgage.[37] The New York Times observed: "while in recent years Mr. Shahzad struggled to pay his bills, it is unclear that his financial hardship played a significant role in his radicalization. He still owned his home and held a full-time job when he began signaling to friends that he wanted to leave the United States."[3]His marriage became strained in 2009 as he pressured his wife to wear a hijab and insisted that the family return to Pakistan while he searched for a job in the Middle East.[3] On June 2, he telephoned his wife from JFK Airport, saying he was leaving for Pakistan, and that it was up to her choice whether to follow him.[3] She refused, and instead she and their two children (a girl named Alisbheba, and a boy) moved to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, where her parents were living.[3]He then defaulted on his mortgage, and was sued by the bank in September 2009 as it foreclosed on his home.[21][46]The New York Times reported that on February 25, 2006, Shahzad sent a long e-mail message to a number of friends.[3] Writing that he understood that Islam forbids killing innocents, he asked those who insisted only on "peaceful protest":Can you tell me a way to save the oppressed? And a way to fight back when rockets are fired at us and Muslim blood flows? Everyone knows how the Muslim country bows down to pressure from west. Everyone knows the kind of humiliation we are faced with around the globe.[3]That year he began to become more religious.[3] He began to pray five times a day, at mosques in Stamford, Norwalk, and Bridgeport.[3]In 2008, while in Pakistan, he asked his father for permission to fight in Afghanistan, but his father denied his request.[3] In April 2009 he e-mailed friends his criticism of the views of a moderate Pakistani politician, writing that the politician had "bought into the Western jargon" of calling the mujahedeen "extremist," and urging his friends to find "a proper Sheikh to understand the Quran."[3] Asked which sheikhs he followed, he said: "My sheikhs are in the field."[3] He also wrote: "Allah commands about fighting for Islam."[3][edit] Attempted bombing of Times SquareMain article: 2010 Times Square car bomb attempt[edit] Reported preparationsOn July 3, 2009, he reportedly traveled to Pakistan and is believed to have visited Peshawar, a gateway to the militant-occupied tribal regions of Pakistan and stayed there from July 7 to July 22.[47] While in Pakistan, he said he trained at a terrorist training camp in what was believed to be Waziristan, according to law enforcement officials.[48]Shahzad's most recent stay in Pakistan lasted for five months; he returned to the U.S. on February 3, 2010, on an Emirates flight from Dubai.[7][14][47][49]Shahzad was believed to have bought the 1993 Nissan Pathfinder which was used in the car bomb attempt within three weeks prior to the incident. The vehicle was purchased through an ad on Craigslist, for $1,300 which Shahzad reportedly paid a Connecticut woman for in $100 bills.[50] The money was paid and the car turned over at a Connecticut shopping center, without any formal paperwork being exchanged.[44][51][edit] Arrest and chargesMetropolitan Correctional Center, New York City, where Shahzad is heldShahzad was arrested approximately 53 hours after the incident,[11] at 11:45 p.m. EDT on May 3, 2010, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers.[12][13][52] He was taken into custody at John F. Kennedy International Airport, as he sat on board Emirate Airlines Flight 202 to Dubai before the plane had moved from the gate.[7][14][15][44] His final destination was to have been Islamabad, Pakistan.[7]Lapses in security allowed Shahzad to board the plane. He had been placed on the no-fly list on Monday, May 3 at 12:30 p.m. when investigators became more certain he was a suspect.[53] Investigators then lost track of Shahzad before he drove to the airport on the evening of May 3, and did not know he was planning to leave the country.[53] Emirates airline agents did not check the no-fly list for added names at 6:30 p.m. when Shahzad made a reservation, or at 7:35 p.m. when he purchased the ticket at JFK airport with cash.[53] Shahzad was later allowed to board the plane. However, a routine post boarding check at 11:00 p.m. revealed that Shahzad was on the no-fly list.[53] Within minutes, agents boarded the plane which was still at the gate and arrested him.[53]Shortly after the arrest, Attorney General Holder said "Based on what we know so far, it is clear that this was a terrorist plot aimed at murdering Americans in one of the busiest places in our country".[15] Holder later said that Shahzad had admitted involvement in the incident, and that Shahzad was providing useful information.[54][55]According to Deputy FBI Director John Pistole, Shahzad was initially interrogated under the public safety exception to the Miranda rule, cooperated with authorities, and was later read his Miranda rights. He continued to cooperate and provide information after he was read the rights.[56]The FBI and NYPD searched Shahzad's Bridgeport, Connecticut, home on May 4, at Sheridan Street and Boston Avenue, removing filled plastic bags.[7] Materials related to the bomb were found in his apartment, including boxes that had contained the alarm clocks, and his car at the airport had a 9mm Kel-Tec SUB-2000 carbine with five full magazines of ammunition, according to law enforcement officials.[47][50]The complaint filed in federal court on May 4, 2010[57] charges Shahzad with five counts of terrorism-related crimes: 1) Attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, 2) Attempting to kill and maim people in the U.S., 3) Using and carrying a destructive device, 4) Transporting an explosive device, and, 5) Attempting to damage building, vehicles, and other property.[7][8] He faced up to life in prison.[7]On May 9, Attorney General Eric Holder announced pending Obama Administration Miranda-warning legislation in the context of the Shahzad case.[58] On June 21, Shahzad pleaded guilty to all the charges against him.[59]As of June 2010, Shahzad, Federal Bureau of Prisons #63510-054, is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City.[60][edit] International ties and investigationIt was reported that Pakistani authorities arrested a number of suspects in the investigation of the attempted car bombing, including two or three people at a house where Shahzad is said to have stayed.[54] Pakistani intelligence officials said a man named Tauseef, who was a friend of Shahzad, was detained in Karachi in connection with the case.[15] Representative Jane Harman, a California Democrat, said Pakistani officials arrested "alleged facilitators" as part of a "far broader investigation."[61]According to the Wall Street Journal, Shahzad received bomb-making training from the Pakistani Taliban.[62] The Pakistani Taliban are made up overwhelmingly of Pashtun tribesmen.[63][64] According to CBS News, Shahzad has been on the Department of Homeland Security travel lookout list since 1999 because he has been bringing in large amounts of cash (approximately $80,000) into the United States.[65]United States Attorney General Eric Holder stated "the Pakistani Taliban was behind the attack. We know that they helped facilitate it. We know that they probably helped finance it and that he was working at their direction".[66]Shahzad told interrogators that he was "inspired by" radical Anwar al-Awlaki to take up the cause of al-Qaeda.[4] Shahzad made contact over the internet with al-Awlaki, the Pakistani Taliban's Baitullah Mehsud (who was killed in a drone strike in 2009), and a web of jihadists, ABC News reported.[67][68]According to a report of Al-Arabiya, Shahzad had recorded a suicide video in which he declared that he planned the attack as revenge for the U.S. war in Afghanistan. In this video, that was made before the attempted May 1 attack, Shahzad was dressed in traditional and tribal Pashtun clothing and was seen sitting with an assault rifle.In his message he praised Baitullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban leader who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in August 2009, and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the founder of al-Qaeda in Iraq who died at the hands of U.S. led-troops in 2006, as "martyrs"."The attack on the United States will be a revenge for all the mujahedeen and oppressed Muslims," Shahzad said in the tape, according to Al-Arabiya. "Eight years have passed since the Afghanistan war and you shall see how the Muslim war has just begun and how Islam will spread across the world."[69][70][edit] ConvictionOn October 5, 2010, Shahzad was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole by a federal judge in New York City.[71] When asked by the judge "Didn't you swear allegiance to this country?" Shahzad, a naturalized U.S. citizen replied "I sweared, but I didn't mean it."[72]Shahzad, wearing a white prayer cap, smiled and said "Allahu Akbar" after hearing his sentence, and said he would "sacrifice a thousand lives for Allah."[73][74] He predicted that "War with Muslims has just begun," and that "the defeat of the US is imminent, inshallah [God willing]."[73][75][76]When asked by the judge at his trial as to how he could justify planting a bomb near innocent women and children, Shahzad responded by saying that US drone strikes "don't see children, they don't see anybody. They kill women, children, they kill everybody."
