Camping adventures can be some of the best experiences of your child's life. With wildlife, fishing, getting dirty, campfire meals, and who can forget S'more. There's something special about sleeping in a tent under the stars. However whether you stay in a tent, cabin, or camper the joy is still immense. Part of the fun of the adventure is planning for the big trip. Allowing your children to help in every step of the way is a great way to teach them responsibility, planning, and overall giving them a little knowledge to help them learn the dos and don'ts of camping. The best spots to camp are near lakes where you can fish quite often. Children, as well as Dad, tend to love fishing. Here are a few tips to help you on your next camping adventure:Pick a camping spot that will reflect what you and  your family want to do. Such as will you be hiking some? Canoeing? Fishing? Bicycling? Some campsites may not offer some of these, so its best to find a spot that the whole family will enjoy. Most National and State park websites give lists and activities available, so be sure to check those out. If you are not a seasoned camper, you may want to consider your first camping experience, with children especially, in a state park where there's running water, bathrooms, and showers. On the next trip you can advance into a more natural camping experience. Be sure to bring the correct supplies needed for each activity. If you are going boating then you wouldn't want to forget your life vets. Just be prepared for every event you have in store. Bring a first aide kit! There's always someone who falls and scrapes their knee! And, it's always better to be safe than sorry. Practice putting the tent together. Let the children help! It's always great to inspect your equipment before you are actually going to use it. What if a piece is missing? Or something doesn't work correctly? This gives you ample time to resolve any unseen issues beforehand. Don't forget a flashlight for every member of the family and extra batteries for each. Also a battery driven lantern for each tent as well. Do not use propane lanterns inside tents--it's extremely dangerous and can result in fatal accidents!Make a menu of what you'll be eating for breakfast, lunch and dinner for each day you are at camp. Some great and fun food items for camp are: hot dogs, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, corn on the cob is delicious wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in the coals of the fire, or anything else that is easy to clean up and cook! Just be sure to bring everything needed to clean up, such as water and detergent. Bring plenty of extra food. People tend to have an undying hunger when in the great wild outdoors. So remember plenty of snacks. cracks and cheese, chips, fruit, and whatever else your children love to snack on. Be sure each person gets their own sleeping bag and a sleeping pad to place the sleeping bag on--the pad will keep the rough of the ground off your little one or family member and ensure they get a good night's sleep! Don't forget sunscreen and bug repellent. Gnats and mosquitoes can ruin a camping trip if you are not prepared! Be sure to bring large tarps in case of rain. Nothing can ruin a camping trip than unexpected downpour. A tarp can be placed over your camp area and keep your rain-free! Be sure to have a talk with your children beforehand about respecting nature! It's important to teach our young ones about nature and our influence on it. Checking out a book at the library can help you accomplish this. There are dozens of books related to this issue and some have great picture illustrations.  Have fun activities for your children to do at the campsite. For example: stories, campfire songs, shadow puppet shows, etc.. Also, be sure to bring garbage bags and always pick up your litter and teach your children to pick up their trash from the campsite and fishing area! This helps in teaching them to respect nature!Coleman SunDome 7-Foot by 7-Foot 3-Person Dome Tent (Orange/Gray)Amazon Price: $43.26List Price: $73.99Eureka Apex 2XT Adventure 7' 5" by 4' 11" Two-Person TentAmazon Price: Too low to displayList Price: $129.99Wenzel Alpine 8.5 X 8-Feet Dome Tent (Light Grey/Blue/Gold)Amazon Price: $41.81List Price: $59.77Buy Camping Supplies Here:Coleman PVC Double Wash Basin,Amazon Price: $10.99List Price: $0.00Coleman Speckled Enamelware Dining KitAmazon Price: $38.49Coleman Tent LightAmazon Price: $7.26List Price: $16.99Coleman Rimstone Sleeping BagAmazon Price: $29.99Coleman Fairmont Sleeping Bag (Purple)Amazon Price: $22.99Coleman Autumn Trails Sleeping BagAmazon Price: $48.26List Price: $54.99Rayovac SE3DLN Sportsman Extreme 300-Lumen LED LanternAmazon Price: $25.00List Price: $30.00Coleman Rugged Battery Powered Lantern (Family Size)Amazon Price: $25.53List Price: $29.99Coleman 4D Rugged Personal Size Rugged LanternAmazon Price: $15.26List Price: $17.99 Evening fishing photo.

A luxurious beach trip is about spending precious time with your children and creating memories that will last a lifetime.There are hundreds of beaches to chose from. In the first video below it lists the top 20 beaches in the world. Whatever beach you chose, be sure to use safety and remember to apply sunscreen to you and your kids ahead of time. Most parents wait until they're at the beach, but sunscreen should be applied at least 30 minutes before you are going to be in the sun. This always the spf time to soak in. Also remember to apply sunscreen every hour until you are out of the sun. Another important thing is to keep hydrated while at the beach. The sun can dehydrate someone quickly. So ensure you bring plenty of water for everyone and call in the kids every little bit to sip on some water!Champion Sports 12in Multicolored Beach BallAmazon Price: $1.90List Price: $14.89Glossy Panel 16in BeachballAmazon Price: $0.41Champion Sports Multi-colored Beachball - 24 inchAmazon Price: $4.20List Price: $16.04Aqua Sand Creation Kit - MermaidAmazon Price: $14.96List Price: $19.99Snow Castle Package [Misc.]Amazon Price: $18.57Green Toys Sand Play SetAmazon Price: $11.97List Price: $19.99 Michigan's Adventure's Thunderhawk ride:Universal Orlando 2011: The Ultimate Guide to the Ultimate Theme Park AdventureAmazon Price: $10.82List Price: $15.95Universal Orlando, 2010 Edition: The Ultimate Guide to the Ultimate Theme Park AdventureAmazon Price: $127.02List Price: $15.95Everything Family Guide to the Disneyland Resort, California Adventure, Universal Studios, and the Anaheim AreAAmazon Price: $14.95Theme Park or Amusement ParksChildren of all ages enjoy the thrills and excitement of theme and amusement parks!
