The flight, an Iranair passenger flight, crashed in the north west region of Iran today. Currently reports are sketchy but it is generally being claimed that there are some survivors. The amount of passengers, survivors, casualties and dead is still unclear, however. There are varying reports, some claiming that half of the people on board survived the crash. The Boeing 777 was preparing to land when disaster struck. Its destination was 460 miles of Tehran at the airport of the city of Orumiyeh. Conditions were said to be poor as the plane came into land with fog in the area. Iran is no stranger to air crashes. With planes generally way past their use by date, Iran's track record is not good. At the moment reporters are saying that 50 people have survived but that is unconfirmed. Some reports say that the injured only received light injuries. Most reports have said that around 50 people have been killed. Updates will follow as soon as information is released.
