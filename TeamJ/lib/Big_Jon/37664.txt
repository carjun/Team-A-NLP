He played the past 16 seasons for that team, and beyond his All-Star-caliber success, he has always been well-liked and well-respected by teammates and fans in San Diego for his affability, for his accountability, for his willingness to help.He lives in San Diego County, and given his personality, it would have seemed natural for Hoffman to return to Petco Park after he retired, year after year, to be introduced to the strains of "Hell's Bells" as he walked out to throw out a first pitch. It would have seemed natural for him to have a relationship with the Padres like the longstanding relationship that Stan Musial has had with the Cardinals.                But his departure from the team, sealed when the Padres withdrew their offer on Monday, was so ugly that it is now unclear whether his relationship with the team will be repaired. This much is for sure: He will never pitch for the Padres again. "That door is totally closed," said Rick Thurman, Hoffman's agent.                 It is closed from the Padres' side -- and from Hoffman's perspective, as well. "Trevor is upset with the way they've handled the situation," Thurman said.                That the Padres will not re-sign Hoffman is not necessarily a surprise -- probably not even to Hoffman. He is 41 years old and in the twilight of his career. This past season, scouts say, his velocity was the lowest they have seen. At some point, the Padres were going to identify a new closer (and going forward, it appears that it will be Heath Bell).                But in early September, it appeared that the Padres would bring back Hoffman for another season. General manager Kevin Towers indicated to Thurman that an offer was forthcoming, and he spoke to Hoffman directly, in Milwaukee, during a road trip. The offer did not come until Oct. 15, as it turned out, and it was for $4 million, or little more than half of what Hoffman made in 2008. Friends of Hoffman thought that the offer was a polite way of nudging the closer out the door -- a way for the Padres to maintain that they had tried to keep Hoffman, while knowing that the offer would not be acceptable.The last negotiation between the Padres and Hoffman, after the 2006 season, had had some ugly moments, with palpable tension between Hoffman and Padres president Sandy Alderson. This time around, the Padres indicated that their $4 million offer was the best that they could do, so Hoffman asked Thurman to arrange a meeting -- with Alderson, Towers and owner John Moores. If Hoffman's time with the Padres was going to end, his feeling was that he wanted to hear it directly from the team's executives.But the Padres declined to arrange the meeting, and this past Friday, the day after Thurman spoke publicly about Hoffman's desire for a face-to-face sit-down, Towers called Thurman and indicated to him that the Padres intended to withdraw the offer. The organization was upset, Towers told Thurman, that the details of Hoffman's offer had leaked out.Hoffman, in Puerto Rico, again told Thurman that he wanted to arrange a meeting, with Alderson and Towers. He wanted to be told by Alderson, man to man, that the Padres were ending his time with the team.The Padres' response: Towers told Thurman that the offer was withdrawn, the negotiation was over. He spoke to Hoffman over the phone Monday night.Hoffman, who joined the Padres amid the team's 1993 fire sale, now departs during its 2008 fire sale, without having the meeting and the conversation that he wanted. After 16 years, the relationship between Hoffman and the Padres ended via cell phone.ShareSix other free agents to watchNovember, 10, 200811/10/088:24AM ETEmailPrintCommentsSix free agents not named Sabathia or Teixeira  who should have interesting journeys through their free agency:Juan Cruz: The guess here is that Cruz might wind up drawing the highest interest (in terms of the number of interested teams) of any player on the free-agent market because of the volatility of the relief market, and because of his staggering 2008 numbers: 71 strikeouts in 51.2 innings, with an opponents' OPS of .655. And in 2007, he racked up 87 strikeouts in 61 innings; he is capable of stopping a rally with a big punchout.Those stats make the 30-year-old right-hander intriguing. There naturally will be concern about whether Cruz's performance was just a case of a one-year wonder, given that he has bounced through four teams over the past six seasons, and given that he posted a 7.44 ERA for Oakland just three seasons ago.Olney's news and notes Holliday to Cards talks dead First-year manager for M's? Evan Longoria ready for AL award Geovany Soto should take NL honor  Andy Pettitte makes it officialAround the majors with Buster Olney But there is such a scarcity in the relief market for someone like Cruz that it figures somebody will gamble on him, in the way the White Sox gambled a four-year deal on Scott Linebrink last winter. Some rival officials think that he fits the immediate needs of the Tigers.Bobby Abreu: The Yankees will likely offer him arbitration and leave it at that, which means that Abreu might stand to make $17 million-$18 million for 2009 if he stays. Abreu batted .296 with 20 homers and 100 RBIs last season, with a .371 on-base percentage, so he will probably draw multiyear offers from other teams; he fits the Cubs perfectly, given that they're comfortable with shifting Kosuke Fukudome to center field. But Abreu has loved playing in New York, and it's hard to imagine any team will offer him more in salary for 2009 than what he would stand to make if he were to accept arbitration with the Yankees. We'll see what happens.Adam Dunn: At a time when home run numbers are down in the majors, Dunn has mashed 40 or more homers in five consecutive seasons, while drawing more than 100 walks in four straight seasons. So based on that, you'd think he'd cash in, right? Well, as we mentioned during the summer, there is an enormous split of thought among talent evaluators about what Dunn's true value is, with some believing that his poor defense, his high strikeout totals and his low batting average greatly reduce his effectiveness.Two winters ago, the Red Sox ignored conventional wisdom on J.D. Drew -- that he gets hurt too much, that his passion for the game is not high -- and signed him to a five-year, $70 million deal. Time will tell whether some team will step out in a similar way with Dunn and gamble a big-money contract on him.Jamie Moyer: He'll turn 46 soon, and there isn't a lot of precedent for someone that old getting a multiyear contract. The notion of committing that kind of money to someone that old probably makes general managers queasy. But Moyer is coming off a season in which he went 16-7 with a 3.71 ERA and pitched well in a World Series start, and he just keeps on winning. On one hand, the radar gun readings of an 80 mph fastball might scare you, but on the other hand,  he doesn't rely on his velocity; like a knuckleballer, he pitches unconventionally, so logically, there would seem to be reason to think that he can continue pitching successfully into his late 40s.But will any team offer him a multiyear deal? It's unclear.Kerry Wood: He signed his first contract with the Cubs, he broke in as a Cub, he set a strikeout record as a Cub, he gave the team a discount in order to stay with the Cubs and he had a remarkable comeback as a Cub in 2008, throwing well enough to make the All-Star team. But he managed just 21 2/3s innings in the second half of the season, and he bears an unusual injury history, so the Cubs might naturally be leery of making a major investment in him -- in a market in which closers are scarce. The Mets have money to spend on a closer, for example. The guess here is that Wood will re-sign with the Cubs, but hey, we'll see how it goes.Ben Sheets: At midseason, he seemed poised for a big-money free-agent score, as the NL starter in the All-Star Game. Then Sheets broke down late in the season, again, reinforcing a perception that he is a serious injury risk. But Casey Close, an agent with a reputation among general managers as a straight shooter, is letting everybody know that Sheets' injury was merely a muscle tear, and not a structural problem in his elbow, and he's got MRIs to prove it. And undoubtedly, Close is reminding teams of what Sheets does when he pitches: Over the past five seasons, his ERA has been 2.70, 3.33, 3.82, 3.82 and 3.09. Over the past five seasons, he has issued just 152 walks in 839 1/3 innings with 785 strikeouts, numbers that are remarkable.Sheets is not going to get Sabathia dollars, but as other top pitchers come off the board, at some point, some team is probably going to make a move on the 30-year-old right-hander, and for big dollars.Around the majors with Buster Olney ShareDark days ahead for San DiegoNovember, 9, 200811/09/088:29AM ETEmailPrintCommentsFourteen years ago, John Moores arrived in San Diego to restore the Padres, to restore respectability and hope for a competitive future to the franchise that had just pawned off Gary Sheffield, Fred McGriff, Tony Fernandez and others in an embarrassing and dark time that will forever be known as the Fire Sale.Moores was not part of Major League Baseball at the time he bought the Padres, and in those days before Google, I recall going upstairs to the library at The San Diego Union-Tribune -- I covered the Padres for the paper back then -- and asking the research staff for help to gather information on a John Moores story. Not John Moore, I said, but John Moores.Olney's news and notes Trade to Boston intrigues Salty Detroit may pursue Japanese pitcher Philly's priority is to maintain pitching Should Texas move Young to second? Diamondbacks lay off 31 employeesAround the majors with Buster Olney His backstory seemed like something out of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington": computer geek thinks of a way to make computers work faster, makes huge dollars, and he and his wife share the profits with everybody in the company. Big baseball fan -- loves baseball. Co-workers told me then that his intention was to move to San Diego and become part of the community. He was, in many respects, the perfect guy for the team and the town, and the Padres have had many successes under Moores' ownership, including the construction (albeit protracted) of the beautiful Petco Park.But now it appears as if Moores will leave the Padres' baseball operations in the same condition it was when he arrived.He is going through an ugly divorce, and as a result, the Padres' payroll is being slashed. While some club officials have tried to downplay the notion of a major budget reduction and worked to cast the changes as a shift to a sleeker, necessary business model -- their words sounding much like those of former owner Tom Werner years ago -- the end result is a cost-cutting sequel. Except, in baseball, instead of "Chainsaw Massacre VI," it's "Fire Sale II." Jake Peavy, the franchise's best player, will be traded soon. There has been progress between the Padres and Braves in talks in recent days, with Gorkys Hernandez being added to shortstop Yunel Escobar within the proposed package of players that will likely be shipped from Atlanta to San Diego. The Padres will also continue to talk with the Cubs and Dodgers, but the expectation is a deal should go down before Thanksgiving.The Padres exercised the $9 million option of right fielder Brian Giles for 2009 on Friday, but doing so is like spending a few extra bucks on a polish job on the fenders and hub caps before selling a used car. San Diego nearly dealt Giles to Boston and later to Oakland during the season, and it stands to reason that this winter the Padres will approach Giles about waiving his no-trade rights to facilitate a trade out of San Diego. (As of Saturday evening, they had not done this.)It's very possible that in the days ahead, the face of the franchise, Trevor Hoffman -- who arrived in San Diego 185 months ago, in the midst of the Fire Sale -- will cut ties with the team. The Padres offered Hoffman a $4 million deal last month, which would be a $3 million reduction in salary from what he made in 2008, and friends of the pitcher wonder if San Diego is merely looking to politely nudge him out the door. Hoffman has responded by asking for a meeting with club ownership to discuss the future of the franchise.If Hoffman ever gets his sit-down, it would be hard for him to walk away with any conclusion other than this: The Padres are being stripped down and prepared for sale, like an old battleship taken down and sold for parts.In early October, San Diego's NBC affiliate reported that Moores would unload his share of the team; the team's response was to call that report "highly speculative." But whether you want to call it a Fire Sale or a business transformation, the fact is that the club's payroll was $74 million in 2008, and if Giles is traded and Hoffman does not return, it could be about half that in 2009. If Peavy is traded, the No. 2 starter for the Padres will be Cha Seung Baek, who went 6-10 with a 4.79 ERA in 2008.The Padres of next summer may well turn out to be like the Padres of 1993, a team with a couple of stars as baubles (Tony Gwynn and Andy Benes filled this role in '93) surrounded by cheap and young players, some of whom had talent that lasted: Hoffman, Brad Ausmus, Doug Brocail and Tim Worrell. Next summer's headliners will be Adrian Gonzalez and Chris Young, it appears, with Hernandez, Chase Headley and others serving in the supporting actor roles, at union scale.The NL West is mediocre and a rebound could come within a couple of years, after Moores' situation is settled. But the Padres of '93 were not competitive -- they went 61-101 -- and by summer's end, the seats of Jack Murphy Stadium were empty; attendance in San Diego went from 21,000-plus in 1992 to last in the majors in 1993, '94 and '95.After the ugliness that the casual Padres fan is seeing now, the '09 team may be awful, and another malaise in the fan base may follow. The organization is going back to the dark ages. It's sad, really. Moores' intention was to do great things with the franchise, and along the way, he realized a lot of that hope. The Padres, steered by general manager Kevin Towers, manager Bruce Bochy and president Larry Lucchino for most of the past 14 years, won four division championships and played in the 1998 World Series.But the John Moores of 1994 -- bright-eyed, buoyant, radiating hope -- never would have envisioned that it would all splinter apart, and that he would depart in the same manner as Werner, who, for years, was regarded as persona non grata in San Diego. The Padres, once again, find themselves desperately in need of a white knight.Around the majors with Buster Olney ShareSabathia makes sense for GiantsNovember, 8, 200811/08/0810:21AM ETEmailPrintCommentsThe San Francisco Giants committed $126 million to Barry Zito a couple of winters ago, and in spite of Zito's best efforts and work to find solutions, that contract is destined to be regarded as one of the most significant busts in baseball history. The Giants shelled out record-setting dollars for high-impact pitching, and it does not appear as if they will get that return.Olney's news and notes Peavy's "train" still at the station The trouble with Manny Ramirez Teams can bid on Cuban third baseman Cuban still wants the Cubs Make-or-break time for RangersAround the majors with Buster Olney But that experience should not discourage them from pursuing another left-hander who will set a new record for pitchers. There are good reasons for the Angels to chase CC Sabathia, and for the Yankees to do so, and for the Dodgers. The team that might stand to gain the most from signing Sabathia, however, might be the Giants.And undoubtedly, Sabathia would seriously consider a big-time offer from the Giants. The drive from Vallejo, Calif. -- the place where he grew up playing basketball and baseball and riding his bike, and the place where his extended family lives -- is just 30 miles. He would get to play in the National League, where pitchers age at a slower rate, as Greg Maddux can attest. He would get to hit, something he loves to do, something he could not do for the Angels or the Yankees. A long-term marriage with the Giants makes all the sense in the world for Sabathia, who is, at heart, a sentimentalist.The signing of Sabathia would make even more sense for the Giants, a team struggling to re-shape its image as it comes out of the Barry Bonds era. For more than a decade, the glowering slugger was the face of the franchise, a Faustian bargain that the Giants made as Bonds hammered home runs and pursued records and drew record crowds. Attendance at AT&T Park fell more than 10 percent last season, and the club's leadership -- led by William Neukom, who has replaced Peter Magowan as managing general partner -- understands that Zito is not going to be the new face of the franchise.Tim Lincecum may well be named the NL Cy Young Award winner when the results are announced in the days ahead, but too often it felt as if Lincecum had to haul the franchise by himself in 2008; the Giants were 22-12 in games in which the right-hander pitched, and 50-78 in the other games.The Giants will look to improve their offense, as well, but the best available options on the free-agent and trade markets are all short-term, patch-and-fill alternatives: Manny Ramirez, on a two-year deal, or Matt Holliday, who can be acquired for one year before he becomes eligible for free agency. No, the new leadership group will want to make a big-time splash, to re-brand the Giants, and who better to do this than Sabathia, a local guy who filled Miller Park in the second half of the 2008 season and demonstrated as much competitive integrity and investment in teammates as the sport has witnessed in recent times? Bonds was aloof, famously did not meet a lot of club employees until his last year with the team, seemed to operate in a separate universe than his teammates, and had to be cajoled into attending the few club events at which he appeared.Sabathia, on the other hand, is known as a gregarious everyman, leaving in his wake in Cleveland and Milwaukee fans and friends and employers who think nothing but the best of him. He would embrace the responsibility of representing the Giants in the best possible way, and embrace the challenge of making the team competitive again -- and there is no doubt that with Sabathia, the Giants could be a major force in the mediocre NL West.No longer would Lincecum or Matt Cain be asked to be leaders of the staff. Sabathia has always been ready and willing to take the responsibility that comes with being an ace, and if he were to join the Giants' staff, Lincecum would slide to the No. 2 spot, Cain to No. 3, Zito to No. 4 or 5; on most days, San Francisco would have an edge in the pitching matchup.A Giants rotation with Sabathia, Lincecum and Cain would be dominant, particularly in home games in San Francisco. The Giants need a quick turnaround, and wise executives learned long ago that the fastest way to make change is through improved pitching.The Giants still would need an offensive upgrade, for sure. But they have seen the Padres mostly compete year after year after year in their large park primarily with strong pitching (this will soon change when Jake Peavy is traded, of course), and with Sabathia filling the No. 1 spot, the Giants would need merely a functional offense, rather than a dynamic attack.Hey, Sabathia will help his next team in many different ways, whether he pitches for the Dodgers or the Yankees or the Angels or the Brewers. But right now, he might make more sense for the Giants than any other team.Around the majors with Buster Olney ShareRays pitchers told to take it easy this offseasonNovember, 7, 200811/07/088:49AM ETEmailPrintCommentsAndy Sonnanstine has mapped out plans for his offseason. He'll be heading to a celebrity poker and golf tournament in Las Vegas later this month, and he's going to find a place in Tampa. He's going to hang out with friends.And he's going to sleep in, day after day -- the kind of sleep where you roll over, glance at the clock and then close your eyes for another cycle or three of rapid eye movement, like a college kid back home right after exams. "I'm probably going to take it pretty easy,"  said Sonnanstine. "This is definitely the longest season I've ever been a part of."Olney's news and notes Cubs may have chips to land Peavy Angels look to replace veteran starter Mets make progress in pursuit of closer Cardinals dealing for NL West slugger? Phillies eyeing pitcher from JapanThe rest of Buster Olney's blog When Rays pitching coach Jim Hickey hears this, he will be thrilled, because above all else, he wants his charges to recover this winter. He doesn't want them throwing, doesn't want them running marathons, doesn't want them to discover their inner triathlete. He wants them working very hard at resting.Because as the Rays are well aware, recent baseball history is littered with teams that suffer a physical hangover from a playoff run that takes them deep into October. The Red Sox had all hands on deck in winning the World Series in 2004, and many parts of the staff broke down in 2005. The White Sox's championship staff of 2005 significantly regressed in 2006. Chris Carpenter led the Cardinals to a title in 2006, and he's never been the same. The Tigers' pitching staff was fractured by numerous injuries in 2007, with staff members convinced that the team paid a heavy toll for the remarkable success of 2006.The Rays' biggest challenge for 2009 might not be in identifying a solid closer, or determining whether Rocco Baldelli will be healthy enough to be their right fielder, or getting B.J. Upton back from shoulder surgery. Rather, the critical factor might be the ability of the Rays' young pitchers -- most of whom set career-highs for innings in 2008 -- to recover strongly and repeat their collective performance in 2009.Consider the innings counts (minors and majors) for the Rays' rotation, the postseason included:20072008James Shields215240Scott Kazmir206.2190.2Matt Garza175209.2Andy Sonnanstine201.1210.1Edwin Jackson161187.2David Price--129.1Even before the end of the Rays' regular season, Hickey said, the staff had discussed how they planned on preparing the pitchers for 2009, knowing that spring training next year will begin a week early. "Spring training is only 12 weeks away," Hickey mused on Thursday. "I want them to flat-out rest.  I want a whole four or five or six weeks of nothing but healing and resting up.  Whether they know it or not, they'll be a bit weary."Hickey would approve if his pitchers did some low-bore physical conditioning over the next six weeks or so, before easing their way back into their preparation for 2009. There's no need for them to pick up a baseball, for example, until the turn of the year, as far as Hickey is concerned.Then, in spring training, Hickey already has loose plans to reduce the number of pitches and innings thrown by his starters. Typically, starting pitchers will have built up their arms by the end of spring training to where they are throwing 105 pitches over seven innings. Hickey will probably reduce the number of outings for his starters by one, and his relievers will make fewer appearances. The build-up before the exhibition season begins will be more gradual, with the throwing sessions staggered. It's possible, as well, that Tampa Bay will have more pitchers in camp in 2009.The alterations may not sound like much, Hickey says, but he is cognizant of saving wear and tear whenever and wherever he can, after his young starters worked for the first time in a postseason, when every pitch is thrown with much more duress, as he said.It may be that the Rays' young starters will be OK because -- well, because they're young, and can bounce back. But Hickey will work specifically to guide Rays pitchers, because unlike the veterans he's worked with in the past -- Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Roy Oswalt, among others -- the Tampa Bay starters may not know their bodies as well, this early in their careers.  "You'll rein them in a little bit more than you would old guys," he said.Sonnanstine will embrace the opportunity to rest. Pitching five innings in the postseason, he said, was like pitching 10 during the regular season. Because of the early start to spring training, he said, "I'll have to factor that into my plans."Joe Maddon has a lot on his plate, writes Joe Smith, what with a wedding dropped into the middle of his offseason.Continue reading Buster Olney's blog ShareEconomic downturn a reality this offseasonNovember, 6, 200811/06/088:52AM ETEmailPrintCommentsBud Selig spoke to Major League Baseball general managers through the magic of video conferencing, like the Wizard of Oz speaking from behind a curtain, and the warning he gave them really isn't anything different than what they'd heard in the past. Be very careful in how you spend your money, don't get out of control. In most years, he might have sounded like Charlie Brown's teacher: blah, blah, blah.But this year, the words ring true because, from organization to organization, those charged with keeping the money ledgers are sounding warnings, and some owners want to make sure that if the financial tsunami hits baseball, then they will be prepared. Some owners -- like the National League owner who recently detailed for his baseball operations people precisely why his team will hold its payroll in place -- want to be proactive and anticipate financial trouble, rather than be reactive and be left to pick up the pieces of a tattered budget next season.Olney's news and notes Red Sox OF drawing trade interest Hughes making strides in Arizona Nats preparing an offer for Teixeira Cardinals ready and willing to deal Extension for D-backs sinkerballer?The rest of Buster Olney's blog The current climate reminds a lot of general managers and assistant general managers of the post-9/11 pullback, in the winter of 2002. Prior to the 2001 season, Alex Rodriguez signed a 10-year, $252 million with the Texas Rangers prior to the 2001 season, Derek Jeter signed a $189 million deal, and Manny Ramirez got $160 million from the Red Sox -- and for years, those contracts would remain as standards in the industry, because the following winter, a lot of the gluttonous deals suddenly didn't fit in with the reality of a struggling economy. Within a few years, the Rangers had to eat about a third of Rodriguez's whopping deal to dump him, and the Rockies were looking to move Todd Helton."That's what you will see this winter -- a lot of teams looking to dump bad contracts," said a talent evaluator.The circumstances are already impacting the way contract and trade negotiations are being conducted. For example:The Mark Teixeira talks: The Angels have indicated to Teixeira's agent that they are prepared to handsomely pay Teixeira to keep him, and the guesstimates within the industry are that they're willing to sign the free-agent to a deal for something in the range of $100 million to $120 million. But they've also indicated that their offer will soon expire; they do not intend to allow agent Scott Boras to shop their offer around to the Red Sox, Yankees and Orioles. "The thing about the  Angels is that they move fast and they are decisive, and if Arte [Moreno, the club owner] doesn't hear what he wants to hear, he will move on," said a longtime AL executive. "He's not going to be jerked around by Scott." And while the Angels are a healthy team, they have generally refrained from straying outside the painted lines in contract talks.The Jake Peavy trade talks: Padres general manager Kevin Towers has said that if San Diego can't get value for the right-hander commensurate for his remarkable track record, then it is prepared to keep the 2007 Cy Young Award winner. But there is suspicion among rival executives that given the Padres' move to cut payroll, and given that the divorce of owner John Moores is driving uncertainty within the organization, the team might be forced to trade Peavy, even if it winds up taking 85 cents or 90 cents on the dollar in value. The Padres' efforts are greatly complicated by the fact Peavy can use his no-trade clause to steer the conversations, or stall them altogether.At some point, the Braves and Padres may well strike a deal built around shortstop Yunel Escobar, center fielder Jordan Schaefer, pitcher Charlie Morton and one more pitching prospect. The Padres are known to have interest in left-hander Jeff Locke, a 20-year-old who pitched in Class A last season.Sandy Alderson acknowledged the possibility that the Padres' payroll will be about $40 million.The Yankees' chances for getting Peavy keep getting better, writes Mark Feinsand.To date, the Padres have indicated they want Tommy Hanson. The Peavy deal remains undone, writes Tim Sullivan.The Manny Ramirez talks: Rival executives noted with interest that Dodgers GM Ned Colletti made a very public show of the team's offer to the slugger. Usually, when a team believes it is in a competitive bidding situation, it will hide the contents of its offer from other clubs. But in this case, Colletti generally outlined the Dodgers' offer -- the second-highest annual salary in history.Others think the reason for this is simple: Colletti wants to ensure that his fan base knows that the team is trying, even if, in the end, the Dodgers don't re-sign Ramirez. Rival executives are also reading the public offer as L.A. making an offer that might represent something close to their last, best attempt to sign Ramirez -- and if they can't strike a deal quickly for what they regard to be a generous offer, they will move on to other needs, such as pitching and shortstop.We do not yet know what is contained within the fine print of Ramirez's offer, such as how much of it is deferred, which would greatly impact the present-day value, as calculated by Major League Baseball and the Players Association. Last winter, for example, after Torii Hunter signed a five-year, $90 million deal with the Angels, for an average salary of $18 million, and Andruw Jones signed a two-year deal with L.A. for $36.2 million, or $18.1 a year, on its face; this allowed Boras to claim that Jones had the highest salary for any outfielder in the game.But the deferred portion of the deal actually drags Jones's contract value below that of Hunter. Ramirez knows all about this sort of contractual sleight of hand, by now, because his previous deal -- worth $20 million a year on its face -- was actually worth $17.4 million, after the deferred, low-interest bearing portion was calculated. At the time that Ramirez signed with the Red Sox, some Indians executives were frustrated by their perception that their own offer to the outfielder was actually worth more, per year, once the deferred dollars were factored in.The Dodgers' offer is for X for two or three years, writes Nick Cafardo; Manny has told friends intermittently that he wants four, five or six years, with the terms growing as the 2008 season progressed. It's unclear what kind of market there will be for Ramirez, writes Dylan Hernandez.The Matt Holliday trade talks: The left fielder is among the best hitters in the game and, in theory, the Rockies could hang on to him if they don't get the kind of offer they find acceptable. But other teams that have talked to Colorado find the Rockies motivated to move the left fielder -- and just as in the case of Peavy, the Rockies might wind up taking less than what is generally perceived to be equal value for a guy who finished second in the 2007 MVP balloting.Nobody will talk out loud about cutting payroll, about belt-tightening, because that kind of conversation doesn't go over well with fans who are looking for big moves, for improvement. But just as U.S. consumers are holding on to their dollars, so too will many baseball teams not called the Yankees or Red Sox.Continue reading Buster Olney's blog ShareJacobs deal opens door for Sanchez in FloridaNovember, 5, 200811/05/088:48AM ETEmailPrintCommentsThe season ended well for Gaby Sanchez. He took a few days off, maybe a week. But he tends to get restless, and so it was in early October that he resumed his work as a hitter, taking some swings at some teed-up baseballs. "I like to have the feel of the swing -- I like to hit," he said the other day, sounding like someone describing how he likes to start his day with a good cup of coffee.He will continue to hit regularly throughout the offseason, and he's working out with a conditioning coach at the University of Miami in an effort to drop some weight, and to put himself in the best possible condition and position to attempt to take advantage of the opportunity that he is face-to-face with right now. The Florida Marlins traded Mike Jacobs to the Kansas City Royals, and it was shortly thereafter that Sanchez's agent, Dan Horwits, phoned to tell him the news, as Sanchez stood outside at a barbecue.Olney's news and notes Mariners, Braves bidding on Tazawa Tigers must shop for a closer Angels want fast answer from Teixeira Boras talking big deal for Varitek Mets inquire about a Rays pitcherRead Buster Olney's complete blog The Marlins made the deal partly because Jacobs is eligible for arbitration, like so many other Florida players, and the Marlins need to save where they can. But they also made the deal partly because they believe that Sanchez is ready for the big leagues. "I'm excited, because it's a better shot to win the position in spring training -- but there are a lot of guys who are going to be going for that job," said Sanchez. "So you have to prepare and put yourself in the best possible position."He will hit a lot this offseason, continuing a regimen that is essentially year-round. Sanchez, who batted .314 with 17 homers, 92 RBIs and a .404 on-base percentage in Double-A in '08, liked to get to the ballpark by 1:30 on a lot of days during the season so he could to do some tee work with a teammate, before regular batting practice a few hours later. There were days when the Carolina Mudcats' staff would order the players to stay away from the park, in an effort to teach them to preserve their bodies over the course of the long season. What you have to do under those circumstances, Sanchez explained, is make sure that you get to the ballpark before the coaches, to get in your daily fix of hitting. It appears that Sanchez will be doing his early-early work in National League parks next season. Buster Olney's complete blog ShareRed Sox, Yankees expected to fight for TeixeiraNovember, 4, 200811/04/088:56AM ETEmailPrintCommentsThe Red Sox and the Yankees stared each other down during the Johan Santana trade talks last winter, each team sort of interested in acquiring the pitcher for itself but mostly engaged to make sure that if the left-hander landed with their rival, the price tag would stay high. When the Yankees offered pitcher Phil Hughes as part of their package in the brief window at the outset of December's winter meetings, the Red Sox were resigned to the likelihood that the Twins would make that deal -- but were satisfied that they had at least forced the Yankees to part with one of their best pitching prospects.In the end, both Red Sox GM Theo Epstein and Yankees GM Brian Cashman probably got their first wish: Santana was traded out of the AL, rather than to their respective teams.But this time around, the prominent player that the Yankees and Red Sox are expected to fight over -- first baseman Mark Teixeira -- will probably land with one team or the other.The Yankees, who will shed about $75 million in expiring contracts this offseason, want Teixeira to bolster their offense and improve their defense, and they will bid heavily, to the point that they might offer the first baseman about the same deal they gave Jason Giambi -- $120 million, paid out over six years. Olney's news and notes Rick Peterson to join Brewers? White Sox shopping Javier Vazquez Braves still favorites to land Peavy Greene subject of trade talks Yanks considering PavanoRead Buster Olney's complete blog This will be part of Cashman's two-front battle to get the Yankees back into the playoffs, with one arm of work complementing the other: If he signs Teixeira and a couple of starting pitchers, like CC Sabathia and Derek Lowe, the signings would allow him to keep prospects, rather than trade them, and continue the reconstruction of the team's farm system.There already is debate within the industry as to whether the Red Sox are really serious about Teixeira. One theory, popular among some agents, is the Red Sox will bid just enough to drive the price up for the Yankees and, after forcing Cashman to spend more than he wants, they'll back away from the table in the end.The guess here, and among some executives, is that the Red Sox' interest is actually much more serious than that, that they want Teixeira and feel like they need him to fortify the middle of their lineup. "Teixeira is their kind of player," said one talent evaluator. "High on-base percentage, great defense, power hitter, he's 28 years old and he plays a position that generally ages well."The expectation of the Red Sox is that third baseman Mike Lowell will bounce back from hip surgery, and that David Ortiz -- with the benefit of a full offseason for his wrist to heal and for him to get into better shape -- will return to mashing AL pitching next year. But they are the Red Sox, with all that that implies, and they cannot assume that Lowell will rebound; they cannot assume that Ortiz will come back. And for what Boston needs, there are really very few options for offensive upgrades in this market. The Red Sox could theoretically try to deal for Matt Holliday, but the cost would be enormous and he will be a free agent after next season. As Boston demonstrated in the Santana trade talks, it really isn't interested in trading young players for a guy who is going to walk away in a year.Adam Dunn is an imperfect fit for Boston's needs, and so are many others in the current class of free agents. If the Red Sox were to sign Teixeira, they would have a glut of slugger/corner guys, with Kevin Youkilis, Lowell, Ortiz and Teixeira; if the Red Sox were to sign Teixeira, Boston might move Youkilis to left field, Jason Bay to right and J.D. Drew to center, with Jacoby Ellsbury working into the rotation in the way that Coco Crisp did in 2008, through injury and planned rest.Remember this, too: Epstein really covets guys with high on-base percentages, even if it means working in the face of conventional wisdom. The baseball industry was very down on Drew, but Epstein valued him for his ability as a professional hitter and signed him to a five-year deal. Twenty months ago, he went to the verge of completing a trade for Todd Helton -- a player who, in his prime, was very much like Teixeira.We'll have to wait to see where Teixeira lands, but this might be the most aggressive head-to-head bidding from the Red Sox and Yankees that we've seen since Jose Contreras left Cuba.The Red Sox are the front-runner to sign pitcher Junichi Tazawa, writes Sean McAdam.Theo Epstein will meet with Scott Boras over the next couple of days to discuss Jason Varitek, writes Nick Cafardo.ShareWorld Series needs warmth, neutral siteNovember, 2, 200811/02/088:56AM ETEmailPrintCommentsMy first memories of the World Series, from 1973 and 1974, are vivid. I remember watching Willie Mays stare into the sun as he tried unsuccessfully to track a fly ball, then seeing him plead without success after a Mets teammate -- Bud Harrelson, I think -- was thrown out at the plate. A year later, the Dodgers, my favorite team, lost to the Oakland Athletics, but along the way, there was a memorable moment when Joe Ferguson -- a strong-armed catcher who shifted to right field -- cut in front of a teammate to take a fly ball in the sunshine, then cut down a runner at the plate.I loved the World Series games that were played during the day because only rarely was I allowed to walk to a neighbor's house to watch the nighttime postseason games. (My family didn't have a television.) In a perfect world, World Series games are played in the sunshine before the fall weather kicks in.To continue reading this article you must be an InsiderAlready an Insider?
