Government and taxpayer-voted funding for schools and libraries has fluctuated significantly during the last two years and some libraries have been closed and lost forever. Will libraries become passe and give way to Kindle shelves in small kiosks on campuses? I hope not. The electronic reader is great, but my best friends were books from the age of four. As an adult, I'd like to live in the back of a library or bookstore. Perhaps that is what I should be about right now, much like Ed of Ed's Used Books in The Cat Who... stories in Pickaxe, Michigan. If libraries pass away, I hope America retains its used book stores until the end, my favorite being the now-defunct The Rookeryin Fairborn, Ohio (now a video gaming store). The store was warm and large, filled with good aromas, and offering 17 rooms of books, each room a separate topic. Rare books were found in among the newer ones, when you had the time to spend for looking. A comic panel of Berk Breathed's Opus shows his lack of acceptance of Kindle - the penguin sat in an armchair with a book by lamplight, the electronic reader on the floor (see collection above, right for similar). Since then, Opus even appears on Kindle!No matter what shape a book may take in the future, we need libraries full of them. To the average person in America, a library is like Hemingway's clean well lighted cafe - a clean, warm place to rest, read, and think, open at least 10 hours most days. Some libraries even have their own cafes [A Clean Well-Lighted Place]. Moreover, its free except for a minor tax burden. Children need these places as much as adults, sometimes for safe, free after-school activities for working families. Libraries are wonderful and it is imperative that we do not lose them.Libraries that have not been closed have been largely forced into cuts to hours and staffing levels. In Franklin County in Ohio, only one library retains the hours and staffing levels that it enjoyed before suffering funding cuts. The Worthington Library north of Columbus is the only such in the county to remain a 7-day-a-week library (6 days in summer). Upper Arlington libraries in the northwest open an hour later during the week, but held onto their Saturday and Sunday hours with minor cuts. Despite cuts, including loss of full days of operations, all of the public libraries in the county hold childrens' and adult reading clubs during the summer and sponsor programs for back-to-school preparedness, toddlers and books, story hours, and several more at the discretion of each library's management. Several plaques and posters are found in these libraries:Quotes on Library WallsIntroduce your baby to books, even if it is just to chew on them.A bookstore is one of the only pieces of physical evidence we have that people are still thinking. -- Jerry Seinfeld. See a clip about Seinfield and the Library at the embedded link. I used to go to the library all the time when I was a kid. As a teenager, I got a book on how to write jokes at the library, and that, in turn, launched my comedy career. -- Drew Carey Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read. -- Groucho Marx (18951977), Beloved American comic Libraries will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no libraries. -- Anne Herbert, American writerThere is more treasure in books than in all the pirates' loot on Treasure Island.-- Walt Disney (1901-1966)There must be something in books, things we can't imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don't stay for nothing. -- Ray Bradbury in Fahrenheit 451Library OrganizationsALA | American Association of School Librarians (AASL)Homepage of the American Association of School Librarians (AASL), a division of the American Library Association (ALA).ALA - American Library AssociationCanadian Library AssociationAMBAC Nacional | Asociacin Mexicana de Bibliotecarios A.C.SLA - School Library Association UKThe School Library Association offers advisory and information services, publications and training for school librarians and Schools Library ServicesAustralian Library and Information AssociationInternational Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA)A Friend at the LibraryAt the LibraryDewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the WorldAmazon Price: $7.25List Price: $13.99Woman's Institute Library of Cookery; Essentials of Cookery; Cereals; Bread; Hot BreadsAmazon Price: $24.48List Price: $24.49Library and Information Center Management (Library and Information Science Text Series)Amazon Price: $38.50List Price: $50.00Acme Novelty Library #20Amazon Price: $12.79List Price: $23.95Woman's Institute Library of Cookery; Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and Frozen Desserts; Cakes, Cookies and Puddings; Pastries and PiesAmazon Price: $26.43List Price: $26.44Foundations of Library and Information Science, Third EditionAmazon Price: $69.00List Price: $75.00American Libraries in the NewsContribution to borough library to increase after split council voteSouth Hills Record3 days agoFaced with budgetary restraints and limited financial resources, Baldwin Borough officials were split on what funding should be given to local organizations for 2011. readmoreCampaign launched to save libraryWeston Mercury2 days agoSUPPORTERS of Cheddar Library have launched a campaign to prevent the much-needed facility from becoming a victim of county council funding cuts.Library Proponents Plead For City FundingThe Dade County Sentinel4 days agoAdvocates for the Dade County Library crowded into a Dec. 30 public hearing held by the Trenton City Commission, alarmed that the town had cut the library out of its 2011 budget entirely on top of never having paid it the $31,000 it had allocated for 2010.Book sale supports librariesDaily Sparks Tribune45 hours agoRENO  Economic turmoil has led to funding cuts for government-subsidized programs across the country, with public library systems among the hardest hit.Advantages of KindleKindle: Amazon's Original Wireless Reading Device (1st generation)GENTLY USED READERS FROM ABOUT $120.Amazon Price: $359.00Kindle Wireless Reading Device, Wi-Fi, Graphite, 6" Display with New E Ink Pearl TechnologyAmazon Price: $139.00Cost SavingsSince books on Kindle can be less expensive and take up far less room than hardback or paperback editions, then the Kindle can be a cost saving device in the long run for American school and public libraries. Since children as early as Kindergarten are receive early computer usage training, they may be introduced to Kindle as well as to print books when they begin school, or before school years at home. The drawback to electronic readers is the availability of a consistent and reliable poweror battery source and Internet connection for additional downloads.Importance of Libraries - ChicagoBooksStar Trek and Philosophy: The Wrath of Kant (Popular Culture and Philosophy)Amazon Price: $9.95List Price: $18.95Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan (Movie Script Library)Amazon Price: $17.90Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan Official Movie Magazine 1982Amazon Price: Star Trek II: The Wrath of KhanAmazon Price: 23rd Century Books and Libraries In the early portions of Star Trek's film The Wrath of Khan, Captain Kirk receives a birthday gift from Mr. Spock in the 23rd Century - a hardback collector's edition ofA Tale of Two Citiesby Charles Dickens. It is a cherished gift from the standpoint of its age and format, but also as a symbol fo the long friendship between the characters, expecially after the temporary death of Spock. Kirk even wears regular eyeglasses to read the book, rather than to take the medication available to successfully treat eyesight problems that include presbyopia or "old eye."Part of the message of The Wrath of Khan, then, is an admonition, from back in 1982 when this film was released, to cherish important people and things - like books. People are friends; books are friends. Let us preserve them both for the children of tomorrow. Classic Argosy Tales Now On KindleCHILDREN OF TOMORROWArthur Leo Zagat (1896-1949) wrote at least 500 short stories for "Argosy" and other pulp fiction publications. Now on Kindle.Amazon Price: $3.95Children of TomorrowAmazon Price: Save Books by Kindle and Good CareThe above short story/novella is over 60 years old and difficult to find in the original print version. The author, Arthur Leo Zagat (1896-1949), wrote at least 500 short stories for Argosy and other early pulp fiction now-classic publications. We can read these stories and those of other classic authors of all writing genres on Kindle, saving the stories in our libraries.Into the 21st Century, we can use our public and school libraries and participate in their programs to shoe the need to sustain consistent funding. We can also take good care of the materials in these facilities, volunteer in them, and encourage children to use as many of the offerings as possible.

I do not have a kindle, but would love to try one.  I can see it saving on space.  Right now I have a ton of books and bookshelves.  On the other hand, I cannot see myself using one all the time instead of having a book.Hello, hello,5 months ago I often wondered what that Kindle etc will do to the world of books.  I love books but will the next generation?  Thank you for a very interestingly written hub.samsons15 months ago voted up & beautiful!  Patty you are right on, loved this hub...KwameG5 months ago Really Great hub about one of my favorite places.I too love libraries, and would hate to seem them closed. Weather or not they must remain a reportoy for paper books, maybe not be in the best interest of all, it would be cool if people were allowed to bring kindle and laptops and multimedia devices to library and be able to view and enjoy unique resources via these devices, for perhaps a minimal charge. Thanks again for a well researched and laid out Hub.Christoph Reilly5 months ago It seems like I practically grew up in libraries. It will be a shame to lose them.soni20065 months ago I love books since my childhood. There was a Delhi Public Library approximately 2 kms away from my house. I used to go on bicycle each day to get a new book to read, but today, I am unable to find good libraries in my area and the most important thing is that I am not able to find some good book lovers too. When there will be no readers because I have turned to either video games or other hobbies, then maintenance and at worse survival of the libraries is ultimately impossible. Very nice hub Patty. My followers need to read this. I have bookmarked this hub to send it to my very few friends who love reading books.Putz Ballard5 months ago Great hub. As a youngster living in a rural area our public library had what was then called a "Bookmobile." It made the circuit throughout our county and it was always a joy to visit the bookmobile to check out books to read. As a volunteer at my branch library,it is exciting to see children coming to our reading programs in the summer and I delight in taking my own grandsons to story hour each week.Jerilee Wei5 months ago Libraries here in Florida are a mixed bag.  In part they are cesspools of humanity where the poor are forced to go to use computers when they don't own, or have access to one to apply for public services, submit job applications, fill out electronically mandatory forms for unemployment compensation.  Among them are the homeless escaping the heat.  Among them are hordes of young people and children dropped off at the doors by parents who use them as a free babysitting service.  Teens who are there to not check out books but to play games, chat unsupervised on facebook, and listen to youtube albeit with headphones so loud that it is uncomfortable to be at the next computer.One of our two library branches, perhaps monetarily keeps afloat, by being places where probation officers meet their clients -- I'm not sure what the reason for that is.  However, I do know that we've had one murder and two shootings at that libary in the last two years.To attact young people to the libary, one local branch has replaced story time with DJ led "events."  Well, let's just say they succeed in getting the kids in (who promptly leave after the show), but for the rest of the patrons, who are relying on the nearby computers to search and for employment in some cases -- the noise level is unbelievable.At the other branch, the staff are "volunteers."  The only books in the elibrary are ones you order, taking as much as three weeks to arrive.  Their answer to Kindle is pre-loaded and portable audiobooks, DVDs, and CDs.At each of the libraries, there are about 40 computers for public use.  So popular that there are hours long waiting times to get on one, fights over who is next, and an hour limit to use.The world of printed words and holding a book in your hands is changing.  The world of libraries is also making dramatic changes.  The loss of quiet in libraries disturbs me the most, only because I know that many young people have issues with distractions and wonder how all of this adds to learning issues.  It's right up there with the times I've sat next to computer users who are searching for girlfriends online.  The worst was glancing over to a man clearly in his late 50s or 60s, writing a young teen about the fact that there is a slight "age difference" -- means nothing when two people are in love.The future of libaries?  Based on this summer's experiences, has me wondering about the future of literacy big time.Dim Flaxenwick5 months ago This was a fantastic read, Patty. I can so identify with your idea of being happy in a book store or a library. Books are the 1st presents I can remember receiving (apart from dolls). I love being surrounded by books and the death of libraries would be a sad, sad day for sure. Loved the cookie monster in the libray too.Thanks again for a great hubPatty Inglish, MS5 months ago All of these are great comments! Happily, there are many avid readers among Hubbers. Professional writers' advice to new writers is often to read as much as possible. I think it works, judging from the high quality writings of each of these commenters.Thanks a million!Pattydallas934445 months ago As you noted, libraries are changing. As an administrator, I had to make a difficult choice: eliminate the single certificated librarian and replace with a library technician. When I attend grammar school, (when plans had propellers) we did not have a library. The "bookmobile" came Fridays. I looked forward to checking out the maximum three books... As a teenager, in the summer time, I would ride my bike five miles to the public library. The library was a friendly, cozy place. Unfortunately as above hubber noted, the libraries are now become a refuge for homeless and loud music... Change is constant.myawn5 months ago I love books and I have an e-reader. But still reading got me through a lot of hard stressful times.So I will still read regular books too.John B Badd5 months ago This is a great hub Patty.  I love libraries and it would be a shame to loose them.KoffeeKlatch Gals4 months ago I agree with everything you said.  It woudl be a tragedy if the children of today are denied the pleasue of going to a library and looking through all of the books to finally choose a few that they can take home to read.  Not to memtion the value of research.MichelleWright4 months ago Someting about the smell of a library and the books takes me back to childhood days. I hope the books stay around for a while longer so my children can appreciate the joy of going to their public library just a little longer.  This is a truly wonderful hub!kazeemjames014 months ago Very educative. Thanks for sharing.Denise Handlon4 months ago There is nothing like a book (or the library that holds them). Certainly, a mechanical device may be ultra techno, but it will never replace the feel, texture, look and pictures of a book.You and I are on the same wave length-I wrote my last 'back-to-school' hub on libraries as well.Great hub.Nan Mynatt4 weeks ago We need to start reading to our children at the age of 3.  We can also read before to get them use to hearing sounds that later will help them to read and spell. Good article.Patty Inglish, MS4 weeks ago I like that idea very much Nan.Yesterday, I heard a short talk by LeVar Burton, who said he wants to bring back his Reading Rainbow. That would be great.Naomi Rose Welty3 weeks ago Thank you for this article! I work in a library and it is such a delight to see so much care, love and intelligence put into a discussion of what is happening to our libraries and why they are so important. Our circulation has gone up as fewer people can afford to buy books, yet we've been forced to cut hours across the system. Funding is very shaky right now, but libraries are every bit as important as schools and can provide things the schools can't. One thing we're seeing a lot of is people using our computers for their job searches. We also have some high school teachers bringing their classes to find actual books for their research topics, which is a great way to be introduced to the library if you haven't already discovered it.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites100Patty Inglish, MSHubPages EliteFrom HubPages America4424 Followers1423 HubsJoined 3 years agoRead more hubs by Patty Inglish, MSContact Patty Inglish, MSFollow Patty Inglish, MSSubscribe to Patty Inglish, MS's RSS feedAnswers The QuestionHubMob Weekly Topic: Back to Schoolasked by Princessa 5 months ago121 answersAnswer this question Ask a QuestionAsk Patty Inglish, MS a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsAre you going to an Orlando theme park on the 4th of July?asked by talfonso 7 months ago2 answersAnswer this questionIs bioweapons development could help the nation???asked by geethakasiram 14 months ago1 answerAnswer this questionRelated HubsHow to Teach a Child to Speak and Improve His Vocabularyby Mama SezThe 7 Habits of Happy Kids:  A Book Reviewby IvorwenTop Children's Toys of All Time  Best Educational and Free...by Frieda BabbleyHow To Build Your Child's Moral Values For A Strong...by Purple PerlStart A Home School Preschool Co-opby wannabwesternSaving Shipping Costs When Running An On-line Book Businessby Alicia Crowder Children's Growth and Development ForumTopicRepliesIt's really bad! posted by LoveNiceRice2Help needed.. 4 year old waking crying at nightposted by swapna12311A New Child In Your Lifeposted by the clean life12Post a new topic5 more topics Tagschildren school preschool books online classic literature k-12 education Recommendations  HubPagesabout uslearning centerblogaffiliatesadvertise link to this pagecopyrightCopyright  2011 Hubpages Inc. and respective owners.
