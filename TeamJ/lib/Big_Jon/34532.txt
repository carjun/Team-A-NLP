Breaking News Facebook Says: "We're Not Shutting Down" Ends Dubious Rumor              Netanyahu Ready for Nonstop Talks with Abbas    Jerusalem :  Israel|Jan 05, 2011By LouiseRoys        1 0     Views: 44      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that he wants to pursue direct, one-to-one talks with Palestinian Authority (PA) leader Mahmoud Abbas until a peace agreement is reached.  I am prepared to immediately sit privately for direct, continuous negotiations with [Mahmoud Abbas] until white smoke emerges, Netanyahu said in a response statement to Abbas comments about negotiations a day earlier.  If [Abbas] will agree to my suggestion to directly discuss all the core issues, we will know very quickly if it is possible to reach an agreement. Abbas said that a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians could be signed within two months if Netanyahu showed goodwill.  Decisions are necessary, he added.  Netanyahu said the ability to directly discuss the core issues is key to the peace negotiations.  Abbas called on foreign powers last week to draft a new formula for peace talks in order to solve the conflict, not manage it. He also said they should help devise a new vision for a peace plan between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  Israel believes the PA should return to the table in order to revive the stalled peace process. Netanyahu and Abbas have not met since peace talks failed in late September. Abbas walked out on the direct negotiations three weeks after they began. Abbas blamed Israels West Bank housing policy for the breakdown in talks. Israel says construction should be addressed in direct talks.  Outstanding issues include water, borders, security, refugees and Jerusalem.  Netanyahu made similar peace statements last week during an interview with Israel's Channel 10 News. Netanyahu said he would see a peace agreement through to the end if the PA agrees to a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognized Israel as a legitimate Jewish state and dropped the idea of the right of return. He said he would not hesitate to pursue an agreement if the PA agreed to these two points, and that most people would support him. Israel's security is paramount, particularly regarding Iran-backed Hamas' indiscriminate attacks on Israeli civilians, he explained.  Hamas recently said it carried out 1,115 major operations against Israel, according to its military wing spokesman Abu Obeida.         1 of 51         Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu addresses the parliament in Jerusalem      LouiseRoys is based in Lowell, Indiana, United States of America,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (77.8%) Czech Republic (7.4%) Norway (3.7%) India (3.7%) 1 other countries (0.0%)           READ MORE: Palestinian National Authority, israeli, Middle Eastern foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration, Israel&rsquo, War Conflict, Netanyahu Ready, Palestinian nationalism, Mahmoud Abbas, Western Asia, Abbas&, political-news, peace agreement, Abu Obeida, disasters-news, Middle East, Israel, Israeli Jews, Jerusalem, israeli-palestinian conflict, Benjamin Netanyahu, Hamas   More News From: Jerusalem :  Israel     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 0                  Enter your comment below       Add Your Comment  Save Changes  Cancel              Related Allvoices Contributions         Palestinians seek quick action from the United Nations over the ...
