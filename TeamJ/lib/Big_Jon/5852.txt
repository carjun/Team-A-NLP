This is my take on it, or at least a list of random thoughts I had and a list of things I saw todayI headed down a bit late, probably shouldve been out by 10:15 instead of 10:40. Oh well. Street parking was scarce, but there were some terrific displays of capitalism, namely empty Ace parking lots charging $10 to get in. I parked a mile or so away and walked first along the bay side of Harbor drive, about 10 minutes after the 11 a.m. rally was scheduled to begin. I dont know how many the teabaggers were claiming would attend or how many theyre going to claim did, but by my estimate they got maybe 250  I heard some other estimates in the low 300s, which are entirely feasible too, as a few more people trickled in until noon or so.15 commentsRead the full article Series of powerful waves rush over seawall, drenching surf contest spectatorsFebruary 28, 2010Local OB Rag staffer Nate Hipple captured these shots this morningOcean Beach, Sunday 8:00 am.Moments after this photo was taken, this bicyclist was knocked to the pavement by rushing water and dragged several meters along Newport Ave.   After the water receded, he brushed himself off and made jokes about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.9 commentsRead the full article San Diego Progressives Sing at Tea Party Counter RallyFebruary 27, 2010Between cloud bursts, sixty San Diego progressives sang songs during the counter rally to the Tea Party gathering today near the Star of India.Activists with the OB Rag and other local groups had tried to mobilize one hundred progressives to stand witness to the rally of Tea Party factions.  But Mother Nature decided to drench the county and undoubtedly many stayed away due to the rain. Still, many stubborn people showed up today between 10:30 and noon just west of the County Administration building to show opposition.Meanwhile, approximately 320 Tea partiers gathered across Harbor Drive.24 commentsRead the full article Mindy Pellissier  from a dog wash to serving Ocean Beach for 17 yearsFebruary 27, 2010Meandering west along Voltaire Street I begin to notice of how truly walkable this area of our community is. The towering trees provide much needed fresh air and shade; the sidewalks clean and lit at night by brightly painted light poles; there are virtually no traces of doggie doo anywhere; many shops have their doors open with business in full swing. From all appearances, Voltaire Street is alive and well in this current economy.As I approach Mindy Pellissiers shop, Dog Beach Dog Wash, at 4933 Voltaire, I notice large coolers of fresh water perched atop custom made semi-circular wooden benches out front. They hover directly above clean dog water bowls that rest on green outdoor turf. Its only a matter of moments before the first of many passing pooches stops for a refreshing drink of cool water.7 commentsRead the full article Coffee Party activists say their brews a tastier choice than Tea PartysFebruary 26, 2010Editor: Check this out. The Coffee Party movement has begun  an answer to the Tea Party movement. One of our bloggers last week in his post called for a coffee grounds movement. Well, his call has been answered.  It is official, San Diego will have its own Coffee Party and it will form from these pages.

On February 24, days after the furor broke, UCSD officials held a campus racial sensitivity teach-in to quell racial tensions on the campus.The Compton cookout, of course, was the boneheaded stunt by a handful of white and non-white students at an off campus to mock, poke fun at, and revel in whats presumed to be the sway and swagger of ghetto life. Theres a problem, actually, two problems with this.4 commentsRead the full article Noose Found at UCSD Library  Student Admits Doing It  In response students take over Chancellors officeFebruary 26, 2010SAN DIEGO  Student protesters have taken over the offices of University of California San Diego Chancellor Marye Anne Fox as a third racially charged episode has brought a new wave of outrage.Students are protesting atop desks and countertops throughout Foxs suite, except for her own sanctum. They are chanting, Real pain, real change. Some are playing drums.Fox has twice addressed students today, once outside the library where a noose was found last night and once in a eucalyptus grove outside her office. Students remain upset with the pace of the administrations response to their demand for action over ongoing racial strife.You cant imagine how pained we are, we are heartsick, Vice Chancellor Penny Rue told the students on a bullhorn.New Update: UCSD campus police and president of the regents have reported that the woman student said she had two accomplices.Some professors have called off their classes for the day and have called for a strike and disruptive demonstrations at the campus in protest of the now three racial incidents.Campus police at the University of California San Diego are questioning a student who admitted she hung a noose on the seventh floor of the university library Thursday night.20 commentsRead the full article Standing Witness to the Tea Party Rally  San Diego StyleFebruary 25, 2010This Saturday, February 27th, a group of local Tea Party groups are sponsoring a rally downtown along San Diego Harbor. And San Diego progressives will be there to stand witness to this rally of tea baggers.Nearly one hundred San Diego progressives have committed to being present at this non-violent counter-demonstration.  The counter protest  really more of a show of strength than an actual protest or counter-demonstration  has been organized solely via emails and word of mouth.This blog website the OB RAG, in conjunction with a number of other San Diego progressive and peace groups have put out the call for the counter effort; we went to cyberspace for the medium of our message.  And just over a weeks time, San Diego progressives have stepped up to be witnesses to our local movement of reaction.54 commentsRead the full article Another Report of the OB Town Council Forum On the HomelessFebruary 25, 2010by OB CindiFor those of you who need to be brought up to speed, last night from 7pm to 9pm there was an OB Town Council Meeting.Earlier yesterday (Wed 2/24) I walked around Ocean Beach and handed out a flier to a handful of people under the pier. My flier had a map giving directions to the Masonic Temple, the time of the meeting, and a request for those the OBRag Ad Hoc Committee were representing to add their voices to the Town Councils issue on homeless.I asked about a dozen youth to come to the meeting to talk about their experience and to help push for a local shelter/camp city and more restrooms.As the meeting started, I took a seat amongst the youth as I had promisedI practice and preach tolerance and coexistence.The meeting kicked off with people running for various districts pushing their platforms.101 commentsRead the full article OB Library Stays Open But Hours Are CutFebruary 25, 2010This year, the city of San Diego was obliged to trim 3.8 million dollars from the library budget. 3.8 million dollars. To put that in perspective, thats roughly 760,000 used books off of Amazon. Thats one library, right there.The Ocean Beach library seemed particularly vulnerable to these cuts, given its proximity to the larger but less centrally located Point Loma Library. Throughout the past few years of budget cuts and closing scares, the Ocean Beach community has spoken quite loudly and clearly against the closing of the small Ocean Beach branch on the corner of Santa Monica and Sunset Cliffs.7 commentsRead the full article Impressions of OB Town Council ForumFebruary 25, 2010by Danny MoralesThe day of the community journalist has arrived in Ocean Beach. The blogger/activists of the OB Rag gave the Ocean Beach Town Council and the community at large a healthy dose of solutions, unity and peoples advocacy.Last nights meeting  double-billed as a forum for Ocean Beach Planning Board candidates and homeless discussion   started its civic booster rockets in red glare style. Firing up with a pledge of allegiance and a lineup of the usual suspects, the meeting had me looking over my shoulder from the get go. Not that I was wary of who was using the bathroom for what but when the mooks from the I agree with everything the police do to get the varmints outta town society got up from chuckling about the Trolls Verboten flier to stand at my rear, did the hair on my neck stand up.23 commentsRead the full article Live blogging at OB Town Council MeetingFebruary 24, 2010The OB Town Council is holding a meeting tonight at the Masonic Temple,which includes a candidate forum for candidates of the OB Planning Board, plus a public forum on homeless.Two of our bloggers, Cindi and Lane, are texting us and we will be sharing with you what they report:7:23 pm LANE: handful of PB candidates that sit on TC as well -7:16  there is a woman speaking  she says she handles homeless issues like vandalism, drunk in public,  insinuating that only homeless do these things.7:11  they are allowing the homeless youth to submit speaker requests! they are going to hear our voice!7:10 pm  talking about housing workshop, student loan workshop, but my thought is what about the homeless shelter workshop?7:08 pm  The meeting just started !2 commentsRead the full article Tea Party Hypocrites  San Diego StyleFebruary 24, 2010On Saturday, February 27, a number of our fellow citizens will take publicly funded roads to a public park to participate in a Tea Party rally at which our publicly funded police force will maintain law and order if necessary. Once our fellow citizens arrive, they will rail against the unfair redistribution of wealth and the size of government.Hypocrisy In ActionOf course it is that very redistribution of wealth which provides them with those roads, that park, those police. And it is that very redistribution of wealth that provides their entitlements of Medicare, Veteran Benefits, and Social Security; that provides their children with public education, parks and recreation centers and libraries. The Tea Party comes with an enormous side of hypocrisy.It is statistically probable that 95% of those in attendance received a tax cut under the Obama administration. 45 commentsRead the full article Nearly 2,000 Students Walk Out of UCSD Teach-InFebruary 24, 2010Thousands of students and administrators attended a teach-in at UC San Diego Wednesday to address a recent ghetto-themed party intended to mock Black History Month and the racial unrest it sparked on campus, but the event was disrupted when the bulk of students in attendance walked out.About an hour into the event at the universitys student center, two female students with the Black Student Union stood up and blasted the teach-in, with one saying, The university and our community will not be fixed by a two-hour teach-in.Saying the university was doing little to address racism on campus, the pair urged their fellow students in the packed auditorium and overflow room to march out of the event, and the vast majority complied. The students filed out of the auditorium, loudly chanting Whose university? Our university!1 commentRead the full article TV Show Terriers Looking for Local OB ExtrasFebruary 24, 2010The TV cop show, Terriers, is currently filming in OB.  And they are looking for local extras.  They are filming a pilot plus a second episode.  This all according to Ted, the owner of Old Town Restaurant on Newport.5 commentsRead the full article Theres racism at UCSD  now theres intolerance against the homeless in OBFebruary 23, 2010For the past week, weve heard about the racism up at UCSD with the Compton Cookout  and a student TV show. Now, we have intolerance against the homeless in Ocean Beach , a community widely known for its tolerance.Fliers being handed out over the last several days in OB have called for the eviction of homeless youth from the community. Calling for Trolls out of OB, these fliers have been handed out by unknown persons to homeless travelers and other people down at the foot of Newport Avenue.This blatant display of intolerance comes on the eve of a public forum on homelessness called by the OB Town Council.  This forum will be held on Wednesday, February 24th at the Masonic Temple on Sunset Cliffs.79 commentsRead the full article Mom, the Woman I Got Whether I Chose Her or NotFebruary 23, 2010There is a belief in some cultures that we choose our parents before we are born and maybe thats true.All I can say is Im glad I ended up with the mother I got. In my way of reminiscing, it seems I can remember our very first moments together with me in her womb all kicked back and relaxed, as I had been for nine months, when unexpectedly, on April 18th, 1938, something gripped me like a cook squeezing chorizo from its hull. And the next thing I knew this woman who had soothed me throughout all those months of the good and cozy life, this woman who had hummed and sung lullabies and spirituals that oozed such gentle soul  this woman was now screaming as though her hair was being snatched from her scalp.10 commentsRead the full article Was the Compton Cookout an Expression of Free Speech?February 22, 2010We just watched a 10News broadcast that showed the results of poll they did regarding the Compton Cookout and whether folks thought the people throwing this party were exercising their right to free speech. I was pretty astounded to see the 53% agreed. My first thought was that anyone who said yes didnt actually read the invitation, didnt hear the actual words used to describe this event.The following was supposedly posted as a Facebook event invitation, read it and tell us whether you think its an expression of free speech, or not.    February marks a very important month in American society. No, im not referring to Valentines day or Presidents day. Im talking about Black History month. As a time to celebrate and in hopes of showing respect, the Regents community cordially invites you to its very first Compton Cookout.48 commentsRead the full article 36 Years ago today: February 22, 1974  the Day Ocean Beach Became an Armed Police StateFebruary 22, 2010OCEAN BEACH, CA.  Exactly 36 years ago today, on February 22, 1974  all hell broke loose in Ocean Beach  and for many of the seventies generation, this day will always live on in their memory as a day of infamy  the day the world came crashing down on our little seaside community.  It was the day that Pete Mahone, a politicized ex-convict and member of OBs anti-Vietnam war community, tried to commit suicide by cop.  It was also the breaking point in police-community relations, relations that had been simmering for years.25 commentsRead the full article  Previous EntriesFollow Us!
