Is it because the pain in her two torn rotator cuffs are keeping her awake?  Is it because the wind is so loud that she cannot sleep?  Is it because the surf is so high that it is beating up against the cliffs making it hard to sleep?  The answer to those questions are a resounding NO!  Then why is she awake?Ill tell you why.  Because there are a  - h  -  - in the neighborhood that do not know that fire crackers are illegal in Ocean Beach.  Roman Candles, M-80s, poppers, etc. are all illegal.  The same people that probably dont own dogs; dogs that are petrified by the loud noises; dogs that have been around gunfire; dogs that have super-sensitive ears that become very scared around the noise and look for a hiding place.Since 7:13pm I have been trying to soothe my 10 year old Golden Retriever.  That is the first time he heard the noises from outside. He tried jumping into the bathtub and hiding; he tried getting under the bed; he tried getting into any open closet; he has paced and paced and paced to get away to no avail.  He is used to the LEGAL firework shows coming from Sea World; the Ocean Beach pier; the San Diego Bay barges. He is even used to the fireworks show coming from the Padre Stadium as well as Qualcomm, but he is not used to the high pitched scream of the Rockets  even though they might have a red glare.  And the little poppers that pop endlessly 10-15 times before stopping only to have new ones lit again.Or the loud M-80s that people light next to the cliffs so they can hear the echo from the acoustical water ways.  (Even those make my ears ache.)Why must the neighbors feel that it is necessary to shoot off these illegal firecrackers?  Sea World started their show early on New Years Eve.  Other places throughout San Diego had legal shows.  And those shows stopped shortly after midnight.I remember a long time ago when I was teaching 6th grade in Chula Vista.  (Yeah  a lonnnnggg time ago) and a wonderful student  Johnny  was getting ready to go into Jr. High after he was promoted from my class in June.  On the 4th of July he and his family were shooting off firecrackers from their Woodlawn home when Johnny didnt release the firecracker in time.  He lost 3 fingers and his ambition to be a baseball player.  And that was when firecrackers were not illegal.  I often wonder what happened to him because he left our school to go to the Jr. High, and I never heard about him again. (Except to be told that he lost a great deal of blood; that his fingers were blown up so badly they couldnt be reattached and he was in the hospital.)My adult daughter told me this morning that she went to a party last night and they lit firecrackers and it was fun! She was somewhat angry that we never allowed firecrackers to be lit even though we were camping in Mexico where it was allowed.  But even with her group last night they stopped shooting off the firecrackers  not to be confused with fireworks  shortly after midnight.In OB, I started writing this at 3:30am and firecrackers are still being shot off.  Buddy is beside himself.  His tail is between his legs; he is trembling; his heart is racing and I am worried about him.  Without apologizing for my thoughts, if what it takes to stop the noise means that someone else might have to have his fingers blown off, let me be the first to offer a match!Share|Did you find this article interesting?

WHAT ABOUT THE AIRPLANES?  I am surprised the RAG post this piece.  Its a dog, deal with it.  I love my four legged friends, but it was NYE & this is a bit crazy.  Dog owners need to realize that this comes with the territory of owning an animal.  Move out to the country if you dont like sounds.  Better tell EMT and FIRE to shut their sirens off when they roll down your street. After all, we dont want to disturb Rover.And this??Without apologizing for my thoughts, if what it takes to stop the noise means that someone else might have to have his fingers blown off, let me be the first to offer a match!WOW.ReplyjudiJanuary 3, 2011 at 11:20 amobwarzone  are you for real?  You think that because the calendar flips over a page that it is ok to disturb the peace by shooting off illegal firecrackers at 3:30 in the morning?  I have a match Id be glad to lend you!  JudiReplyannagraceJanuary 3, 2011 at 11:25 amJudi- I envisioned you sitting in a walk in closet with Buddy next to you in the wee hours of the morning.  I dont think that it is unreasonable to expect people to put a lid on the noise making before midnight.   Hope you both get a nap today!ReplyOBWarZoneJanuary 3, 2011 at 12:09 pmJudi,  its not just about fireworks. See a portion your insomnia article below.  Seems like you have an issue with any noise after midnight, including the waves crashing, night herons,  police helicopters, car alarms and more. A place like Jamul or Valley Center seem to be what you are looking for.Maybe, if I am lucky, I can go two hours without waking, but that is usually not the case. NoI am looking for the elusive all nighter. You know, the full night sleep without the blasted helicopters waking me up as they search the seas for drug runners, or illegals.I mean a full night sleep without someones security alarm beeping when they go out to their car to retrieve something at 2:00am. I dont understand why the bartender neighbor down the street MUST have his stereo blaring when he comes home from work night  no morning  after morning.Sometimes the wonderful sound of the waves crashing on the cliffs wakes me up. Or how about the seabirds excitingly calling to their friends when a school of bait fish are spotted near the shoreline. The night herons are wonderful examples of spreading the word.http://obrag.org/?p=26433ReplyjudiJanuary 3, 2011 at 1:50 pmWow! OB War Zone  quoting my own articles back to me is sincere flattery. You must be a man.  The firecracker article WAS just about firecrackers. I did not complain about other things in the article. I am concerned that a poor dog might have a heart attack and die because of the stupid ILLEGAL antics of the people living around me.  Look at Franks answer  dogs in OB go crazy on this night  and on the 4th of July.  I am not complaining about Sea Worlds fireworks, although I am very concerned that they are polluting the environment to the point that when it is finally realized it will be too late.  Dogs have very sensitive hearing and unnecessary noise  illegal at that  should be addressed by the powers that be also.As far as offering you a match; if you are willing to set off illegal fireworks at 3:30 in the morning, the least I can do is offer you a match. If you are going to hurt my dog, I sure as hell am going to hope that you get hurt too!  I will be glad to give you a whole box of matches, as long as you shoot those Roman Candles away from my dog!  In fact, I have all sizes of matches  maybe you would even like to do what the neighbor did last year, and light the fuse of the Roman Candle and then toss it in the storm drain across the street.  You sound like you have a rather healthy imagination  try to guess what that sounded like  EACH OF THE 3 TIMES HE DID IT!  I am not complaining about the normal, natural noises of Ocean Beach.  I LOVE to hear the night herons  even when they lived in the pine tree right outside of my window and did two things with regularity  pooped and talked.  I didnt take the tree down  it blew down  maybe it got tired of being talked to all night.  I love the sound of the surf; the wind through the trees;  and yes, I would love to have a full night sleep without the noises that WAKE ME up  not the ones that put me to sleep. (Read:  police helicopters chasing after the drug runners).And Annagrace  Buddy and I did sit in our walk-in closet to get away from the noise, except he still heard it and only stayed a few minutes!  I thought it was rather cozy, myself!ReplyOBWarZoneJanuary 3, 2011 at 2:38 pmI must be a man because I remembered your other article & posted a quote? That makes sense.I dont own any fireworks & dont plan on it.  I was being a bit sarcastic as well. Your talk of people hurting your dog and hopes of those who do getting hurt is a bit out there if you ask me. Your dog wont have a heart attack because of a few firecrackers.  I love folks who treat dogs like they are their actual children, and not a pet.  Tell Buddy to be a man & grow a pair.Yes, this was about firecrackers.  Your other story was about every other sound in OB @ night. Between the two articles, you confirm that you are annoyed by urban noise, yet you decide to live here. Sorry, you cant only have your natural sounds if you live in OB.BTW,ReplyOBWarZoneJanuary 3, 2011 at 2:39 pmHAPPY NEW YEAR!ReplyjudiJanuary 3, 2011 at 5:01 pmNo..you must be a man because you use chicken-wire logic.ReplyOBWarZoneJanuary 3, 2011 at 5:08 pm=/Obviously you have your own agenda. I like to poke here and there, & stir the pot on the OB RAG. No hard feelings.  People are entitled to their own opinions.   Im done here. Best Wishes. Happy New Year. Cheers!Yours Truly,Chicken WireReplyFrank GormlieJanuary 3, 2011 at 12:45 pmIts known throughout OB that on July 4th during the fireworks, dogs go crazy. Many run away and the next day there are lost dog signs up all around OB.  I had an elderly neighbor for awhile that would go around just before the fireworks were set to go off and warn her neighbors to get their dogs inside. My main old beef used to be with SeaWorld and their fireworks going off at 10pm during the week while I was trying to get my daughter to go to sleep. If the winds were right, it would sound like a literal invasion happening right at our shores. Firecrackers have been around a long time and they arent going away any time soon, but setting them off at 3:30 am? Thats too much.ReplyOBWarZoneJanuary 3, 2011 at 12:54 pmagreed, 3:30 am is too much. But so is offering us match to blow our fingers off .ReplyFrank GormlieJanuary 3, 2011 at 1:12 pmI think Judi was being sarcastic, you know that sarcasm that springs up when youre royally annoyed.ReplyOBWarZoneJanuary 3, 2011 at 1:18 pmI know. But I picked up some roman candles & was looking forward to scoring some free matches.ReplyAbbyJanuary 3, 2011 at 12:47 pmAs annoying as it can be at times, I try to see the noise as the price I pay to live here.I could always move to a quieter (and much cheaper) area, but its worth it to me to live somewhere as vibrant and wonderful as OB.ReplyOBWarZoneJanuary 3, 2011 at 1:18 pmthis. /\/\/\ReplyJPinSDJanuary 3, 2011 at 1:44 pmIm more annoyed with all the illegal dog crap on the sidewalks. And, I might add that this happens at all hours.Owners please pick up after them!ReplyOBWarZoneJanuary 3, 2011 at 2:40 pmMaybe we can turn the crap into some sort of firecracker. Win WinReplyAbbyJanuary 3, 2011 at 2:54 pmOn the sidewalks? Im putting in a security camera to catch the jerks who keep letting their dogs go in my driveway and yard!ReplySarahJanuary 5, 2011 at 5:03 pmDog poop?  Yall must live in the NICE section of OB.  Id like to get someone to scoop the people poop around my place.ReplyjudiJanuary 5, 2011 at 5:16 pmI thought about you today, Sarah, as Buddy and I were taking our daily walk. I passed a house that had a very pretty dark teal -colored bag on the lawn of the house we were passing.  Filled with dog poop.  Pretty classy, huh?  Ya know  picking it up and bagging it and leaving it is not much different than not picking it up at all!ReplyAbbyJanuary 5, 2011 at 6:49 pmIm turning the hose on the next one I catch on my property. The owner that is, not the dog!ReplyWankabankalankJanuary 3, 2011 at 6:47 pmThe fireworks align perfectly w/ Americans love for battles, warzones, the war hero & the celebration of patriotic aggression.  Here in La Mesa we can hear Sea Worlds ridiculous display; its time to protest that racket.  Everyone in OB should simply protest the fireworks displays.  Everyone except the following:    Those who agreed w/ the Supreme Court stopping the vote counting in the 2000 presidential election    Those who actually think the U.S. military is stationed in Afghanistan to save the people from the Taliban    Those who listen to Rush Limbaugh    Those who listen to Laura S. on the radio    Those who think the Torrey Pine tree is leaning to the right    Those who think Israel has a right to defend itself by killing people delivering food to Gaza    Those who think AT&T, Diebold, & Blackwater are reputable companiesIf I keep going, it will only leave that guy who panhandles money right by the Starbucks.CiaoReplyLeighJanuary 3, 2011 at 6:52 pmJudi  I agree with you, for whatever its worth.  Firecrackers  or any intentional loud noise  late at night is just rude.  I will, for the purposes of this post, disregard the dogs (though I have quite a few and would be upset myself if someone were doing something rude  and illegal  and scaring them at 3 am).  The fact is, there are people who are trying, justifiably and not unreasonably, to SLEEP at that hour.  There are your run of the mill average people, middle aged women and men who (much like myself) might not be as thrilled by firecrackers or heavy metal or your motercycle as you are.  There are your babies and children, your little old women and men, people who are ill, those who work odd hours and might need to get up at 5 am on New Years Day to go to work.  The fact that it is a holiday doesnt give people the right to infringe on others  and firecrackers at 2:30 or 3:00 am is an infringement.ReplyBillRayDrumsJanuary 5, 2011 at 12:26 amJust saw the dog thread and thought Id share.Today (well yesterday) some person had their dog parked outside South Beach. I came around the corner and walked past the dog. It was a young pup and it jumped up and grabbed my coat with its mouth. Of course I stopped and then the dog grabbed my shirt. OK!So I get this mutt off me and then the damn thing just full ON launched into my junk; gots me a toothmark to prove it too. (ouch)Of course I let the owners know of their dogs behavioral problem and also told South Beach management. The owner was apologetic in the sense of say a recording engineer who accidentally sends a 1k tone into your headphones at +105db (e.g. a very loud piercing frequency) and utters the token Oh, sorry.Wasnt worried so much about myself as I was about a kid.ReplyOBWarZoneJanuary 5, 2011 at 11:28 amWhat about dog owners who let their dogs bark? A sound of a dog barking, depending on your location, could be as loud as 100 decibels. Some cities limit continuous barking to 10 minutes during the day and five minutes after 10 p.m. or the owner would be subject to a $250 fine. Talk about a   h    -s.ReplyjudiJanuary 5, 2011 at 5:18 pmThank goodness we agree on something! I call the police when a dog barks for a long time.  It tells me that the dog is being neglected.  And.it disturbs me, no matter what time of the day.Billy Ray  what a scary situation.  What if you were a child?  What, if anything did the dog owner do?ReplyAlissaJanuary 5, 2011 at 7:48 pmYour opinions were definitely moving for me (I am a dog lover), and someone losing fingers is definitely not okay. I also agree that that noise should cease after 10pm (or at least 1am on New Years). But I bfireworks fondly. In fact I remember shooting off (my parents) bottle rockets as a child right here in my little back yard. I was born in Ocean Beach and often refer to it as the unofficial bottle rocket capital of the world. So give you puppy lots of hugs and kisses, take some deep breathestis the land of OB.ReplyAbbyJanuary 6, 2011 at 12:11 pmI have to say, New Years was last week, and people are still lighting off fire crackers.ReplySarahJanuary 6, 2011 at 12:20 pmIll trade your firecrackers for the creep on the seawall with the VuvuzelaReplyCancel reply Leave a CommentName *E-mail *WebsiteWant to be notified of follow-up comments by email?
