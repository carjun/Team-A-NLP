She can also speak in English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu, Tamil, Urdu and can understand basic French. [citation needed]She attended St. Anthony Girls' High School, located in Chembur, and later attended Podar College. She was the captain of the baseball team and has earned a black belt in Karate [3] She is one of Bollywood's tallest actresses and currently resides in Mumbai.[edit] CareerThis section requires expansion.Shetty started her career by modelling for Limca in 1991,[4] and made her film debut in Baazigar (1993) playing a murder victim of her psychopathic boyfriend. Although she was a supporting actress alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, the film was a major success and earned her the Filmfare Award nomination for the Filmfare Best Debut Award.[citation needed] This was followed by the success of Main Khiladi Tu Anari (1994) opposite Akshay Kumar.She has since appeared in a number of films, such as Jaanwar (1999), Dhadkan (2000), Indian (2001), Fareb (2005), and Dus (2005). None of these films were major successes at the box office, although she won critical acclaim in 2004 with her performance as an AIDS victim in Phir Milenge (2004).Shetty was featured in Mani Ratnam's stage show, Netru, Indru, Naalai. She has also featured in Jhalak Dikkhlaja, a Sony Entertainment Television dance show.[citation needed]In 2004 Shetty was a guest judge on the popular Indian Idol television show. Her younger sister Shamita Shetty is a budding Bollywood actress and they worked together on the Baras Ja music video for Fareb.[edit] RomanceShetty is a frequent subject of speculation regarding romance.[5] However, she has remained tight-lipped whenever questions of marriage are posed to her. In an interview for the Times of India, Shetty quashed rumours of a romance with director Anubhav Sinha and claimed to have changed her mobile phone number in order to concentrate on her busy schedule.[6] Currently happily single and not dating, Shetty has stated that she plans to marry in three years.[5][edit] Celebrity Big BrotherThis section documents a current event. Information may change rapidly as the event progresses.Main article: Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK)Shetty is currently a contestant in Celebrity Big Brother UK.[7] and is the first Indian celebrity drafted in to "sex up" the show.[8][9] Reportedly paid Rs.31.5m (367,500) for her participation,[10] she wore a pink sari when entering the house and said to presenter Davina McCall, "I just want every Indian to be extremely proud that I'm in here".[11] As for her participation, she stated: "I have zero expectations. The only thing I really hope to keep is my self-respect and my dignity."[12] Sister Shamita told the Times of India that this "is the boldest decision Shilpa has taken hitherto."[13] The Scotsman has reported that PETA are backing Shetty to win the contest and have urged British viewers to vote for her.[14][15]On Day 2 of the show, Shetty instructed fellow housemates Carole Malone and Ken Russell in meditation. After they were unable to perform the exercise, she explained this as they're "not breathing right".[16] On Day 5, romance appeared to be on the cards as Dirk Benedict expressed his desire to woo her after several flirtations had occurred between them[17] and she admitted to finding him "sexy",[18] but tempers were starting to fray by Day 7 as a certain clique was beginning to form in the house which was not approving of Shilpa's presence.[19][20].Shilpa is currently up for eviction along with fellow housemate Jade Goody.[21] In spite of this, she is the current favourite to win from Paddy Power[22]. Goody, is also the least favoured to win.[edit] Racism controversyA record 30,000 complaints have been received by OFCOM and Channel 4 and 30 of them have been passed to Hertfordshire police for investigation.[23][24] The complaints relate to the alleged racism by several of the housemates.[25][26][23] Viewers were outraged by ganging up on the actress by Danielle Lloyd, Jo O'Meara and Jade Goody poking fun of her accent, and voiced their concerns on Internet forums.[27] Jack Tweed reportedly called her a "fucking Paki"[28] although show producers have denied this, stating that the word used was "cunt" and was bleeped out.[24][29]Shetty had been branded a "dog" by Lloyd who claimed the star "wanted to be white", and former housemate Jackiey Budden repeatedly referred to her as "the Indian".[30] When the actress cooked a chicken for her housemates, OMeara refused to eat it commenting that Shetty's cooking was responsible for her "getting the shits." The clique have frequently complained about Shetty and mimicking her accent, protesting against her touching of their food during preparation. Lloyd speculated about eating habits: "They eat with their hands in India, don't they? Or is that China? You don't know where those hands have been."[24] Objecting to the disposal of left-over chicken soup and bones down the toilet, Tweed suggested that Shetty should pick the bones out with her teeth, prompting her reply "There's a lot more I want to do with my teeth." Lloyd commented that she should "fuck off home".[24]. Lloyd has also claimed that Shetty could not speak proper English,[citation needed] while Goody has continued to refer to Shetty as "Shilpa Poppadom" claiming that it was a reference to Indian food.[23] Shetty has been reduced to tears on several occasions, confiding to Ian Watkins: "I feel like I'm losing my dignity."[30]Responses have come from a variety of sources. Carphone Warehouse has suspended its sponsorship of the show[31] and the Act Against Bullying charity has dropped Goody from their list of patrons in spite of the latter's past support, branding her behaviour as "unforgivable".[32] The Eastern Eye newspaper launched an online petition that has registered 20,000 signatures,[24] while Shetty's mother, Sunanda, told the BBC's Asian Network that she hoped her daughter would be able to handle the situation. "My daughter is a strong kid and I am sure she is handling it with dignity," adding that she was "saddened" by the "distasteful" treatment by the other housemates.[33] Former housemate Carole Malone also told the BBC Asian Network that the attacks were motivated by "jealousy" over her beauty and success.[26]The controversy reached the British Parliament as Labour MP Keith Vaz tabled an early day motion in the House of Commons about the racist treatment, saying: "We would not tolerate this kind of racism on other types of television programme and we should not do so on a programme that is watched by millions of people."[34][35] By 2007-01-17 the row threatened to escalate into an international diplomatic incident. British PM Tony Blair, in response to Vaz's motion, responded "We should oppose racism in all its forms."[36] Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, currently in India on a visit to promote relations, condemned the controversy as "offensive" and the opposite of what Britain stands for: "I want Britain to be seen as a country of fairness and tolerance. Anything that detracts from that I condemn."[24][37] Journalist Nick Robinson, accompanying Brown, stated that Britain's reputation was being "damaged" according to Indian diplomats.[38] Blair is facing a formal complaint from Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Anand Sharma that could sour relations and damage trade between the two countries as angry Indians marched in the streets and burned effigies in protest,[36] and where the show has been termed 'Bigot Brother'.[39]Further rows in the house caused Shetty to speculate if she was a victim of racism, [40] but later denied it: "People say things in anger."[23] In a statement, Channel 4 denied claims of racist bullying against Shetty: "To date there has been no overt racial abuse or racist behaviour directed against Shilpa Shetty within the Big Brother house. However there has undoubtedly been a cultural and class clash between her and three of the British females in the house."[40]OFCOM continues to receive complaints.[citation needed][edit] Famous associationsAs well as modelling and acting, Shetty has associated herself with several other commercial and non-profit organizations.[edit] HIV-AIDSIn February 2006 Shetty lent her support to a BBC-endorsed television show designed to tackle the problem of HIV-AIDS in India.[41] The project, which also involved other celebrities Vivek Oberoi, Dia Mirza, and Raveena Tandon in separate episodes, featured Shetty as she shadowed a young achiever whose work involved raising awareness about the condition. "I have participated to show my solidarity to people living with HIV-Aids. I will do anything for them to feel wanted and special," she said.[41]The issue is particularly close to Shetty's heart as she had portrayed an HIV-positive sufferer in her 2004 movie Phir Milenge. Speaking about the movie and HIV in general, Shetty said: "Why not a film on HIV positive patients? It is a social stigma in our society. We made this film to highlight this problem ... This film will bring about a social awareness about AIDS in our country. It is high time we talked about this in our society."[42][edit] PETAPETA campaign advertisementIn March 2006 various sources reported Shetty's joining PETA as part of an advertising campaign against the use of wild animals in circuses.[43] According to a PETA India press release, Shetty is a long-time PETA supporter and has assisted the campaign by posing for photographs in a figure-hugging tiger costume. She explained that her crouching in a cage was uncomfortable during the photoshoot, but that her discomfort was insignificant compared to the pain suffered by the creatures. "These once dignified animals only leave their cages, which are barely larger than the size of their bodies, for a few minutes each day to be forced into the ring to perform tricks which make no sense and are upsetting to them. The best way to help animals suffering in circuses is to boycott the circus".[44]Shetty revealed in a later interview that she felt strongly about this cause and that she was appalled to hear of the cruel treatment suffered by such animals. "I thought I should stop that. If I can make a little difference to their lives, why not go for it?"[42][edit] Romanov VodkaIn a May 2006 press conference, it was announced that Shetty would be the brand ambassador of Romanov Vodka.[45][46] Sami Lala, President of United Spirits, said that Shetty was chosen for her status as an "aspirational icon", and that her "innate style, energy and attitude highlight the core attributes of the brand."[45][edit] Controversies[edit] Mafia linksIn May 2003 a controversy erupted over alleged links between Shetty's parents and the Indian underworld. The Surat police issued arrest warrants against her parents on charges of extortion.[47] Police Commissioner of Surat, D.K. Gupta, told the media that the owners of Praful Sarees had lodged complaints with them after claiming to receive threatening telephone calls from Mumbai-based underworld figures asking for money on behalf of the Shettys. The dispute between the two parties related to a 1998 modelling assignment where Shilpa endorsed Praful Sarees and had only been paid Rs. 50 lakhs (over $113,000) out of a contractually-agreed agreed 3 crores ($679,000).[47] Agarwal claimed that the full sum had been paid in advance, but he had no knowledge of how much had been paid to Shilpa.[48] Surendra Shetty was refused bail by a Mumbai court although bail was granted to Sunanda,[49] as she had been travelling abroad at the time the warrant was issued. The police further claimed to possess a record of a telephone call between Shilpa's parents and Pankaj Agarwal, the owner of Praful Sarees. This was denied by the parents and the tape was claimed to have been "manipulated".[50][51]Sunanda Shetty held a press conference on June 5 where she denied that the family had underworld connections and that the whole fracas was a "plot to tarnish the image of my daughter."[52] She further said that she was "definitely innocent" of the charges and was falsely implicated by Agarwal after he had failed to fully reimburse Shilpa for her work.[53] On June 13 it was reported that Surendra had confessed to establishing contact with associates of Fazl-ur-Rehman, leader of the Mumbai gang, after being interrogated by police.[54] A contradictory story surfaced that, although the Shettys' driver, Dilip Pashekar, admitted to introducing Surendra with Rehman's associates, Surendra continued to deny that any links were forged.[55] A senior police official confirmed that Surendra had "vehemently denied" his links even though he and Pashekar were interrogated side by side. Shetty's lawyer later clarified that the reports of confessing to mafia links were false.[56]Court hearings revealed that, despite Shetty's denials, print-outs of cellular phone records proved that contact between Shetty and the gang had taken place.[57] On June 20 Surendra Shetty was formally arrested after surrendering to the police, later telling news reporters that the entire issue was designed to malign him and his family. When asked about the underworld's involvement, Shetty said "I don't know, I talked to them only after they called up and said they were agents of Agarwal."[58] Further court hearings cast doubt on the veracity of the evidence tapes; Shetty's defence claimed that it was Agarwal who recorded the telephone calls rather than the police, and that the possibility of dubbing or manipulation could not be ruled out.[59] Shilpa was quizzed by police upon her return to India after returning from overseas filming assignments, denying all knowledge of any involvement between her parents and underworld figures and claimed that she had no knowledge of the case until it became public through the media.[60] She further stated that her mother had power of attorney over her financial affairs and disclaimed any knowledge of payment for the Praful Sarees affair. Sunanda's bail hearing had been adjourned three times during the case due to health grounds.[61]Another strange twist occurred when the Shettys' driver, Dilip Pashekhar, was arrested.[62] On Nov 5 it was reported that Surendra and Sunanda Shetty, among three others, were chargesheeted and which paved the way for a trial commencement in a local court.[63] The trial is still pending. In August 2006 Sunanda said that Shilpa had no involvement with the case and that the arrest of Fazl-ur-Rehman earlier that month would not have a negative effect on Shilpa's career. Shilpa has threatened to claim damages after an unnamed local tabloid allegedly printed incorrect information about the case.[64] In an interview for Filmfare, Shilpa said that she was very "cut up" and "devastated" with the way the case had turned into a trial by media and that they had behaved "unethically".[65] She also said that this was the worst controversy she had ever been through, and expressed her thanks to several film figures for standing by her, including Raj Kumar Santoshi and Anil Kapoor.[edit] Obscenity chargesIn April 2006, a Madurai court issued non-bailable warrants against Shetty and Reema Sen for "posing in an obscene manner" in photographs published by a Tamil newspaper.[66] The report stated that the two actresses had failed to comply with earlier summonses for the same reason, hence the issuance of the warrants.[66] The petitioner submitted that the paper had published "very sexy blow-ups and medium blow-ups" in its issues December 2005 and January 2006 issues, and which allegedly violated the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act 1986, Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act 1956, and the Indian Penal Code Section 292 (Sale of Obscene Books). The petitioner further demanded that the images should be confiscated under the terms of the Press and Registration of Book Act 1867.Shetty responded that she had not received any court summons and also dismissed the charges. She further claimed that the pictures were freeze-frame shots from a recent movie that only exposed her navel. "As far as my photographs go, what is obscene about it? If navel-showing is obscenity, then our traditional Indian outfit - the traditional sari - should be banned in the first place."[67]In January 2007 outgoing Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal confirmed that Shetty had written to him in order to enunciate guidelines against frivolous lawsuits against artistes, but refused her plea on the grounds that she should have filed a formal petition instead of writing a letter.[68][edit] TriviaOne of her nicknames is 'Silly Pooh'.[69]She was on the cover of the first issue of OK! Magazine to be sold in India.[70]Within five days of setting up an email address to keep in touch with fans, Shetty was inundated with thousands of marriage proposals.[71]She is a black belt karate champ.[1][edit] Awards and honours[edit] Won2005: AAHOA Award for Phir Milenge2004: Special Awards for Phir Milenge2004: Giant International Awards for Phir Milenge2004: Indo-Pak's Young Achiever Awards1998: Zee Gold Bollywood Awards, Best Supporting Actress for Pardesi Babu[edit] Nominations2004: Sansui Viewers Choice Movie Awards, Best Actress for Phir Milenge2004: Star Screen Award Best Actress for Phir Milenge2004: Sports World Film Awards, Best Actress for Phir Milenge2004: Filmfare Best Actress Award for Phir Milenge2004: Zee Cine Award Best Actor- Female for Phir Milenge2004: IIFA Best Actress Award for Phir Milenge2004: Bollywood Awards, Best Actress for Phir Milenge2002: Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award for Rishtey2002: Star Screen Award Best Comedian for Rishtey2002: Sansui Viewers Choice Movie Awards, Best Comedian for Rishtey2000: IIFA Best Actress Award for Dhadkan1998: Zee Gold Bollywood Award, Best Supporting Actress for Pardesi Babu1993: Filmfare Best Debut Award for Baazigar[edit] FilmographyYearFilmRoleOther notes2007Happy BirthdayAnnounced2007MetroFilming2007ForeverAmrita LedewPre-production2007DurbarBarsaat DeviAnnounced2007ApnePost-Production2006Shaadi Karke Phas Gaya YaarAhana2005DusAditi2005FarebNehaBaras Ja remix video with sister Shamita2005Khamosh: Khauff Ki RaatSonia2005Auto ShankarMoney LenderKannada2004Phir MilengeTamanna SahaniNominated, Filmfare Best Actress Award2004Garv: Pride and HonourJannat2003Ondagona BaaBelliKannada2003Darna Mana HaiGayathri2002KarzSapna2002RishteyVaijantiNominated, Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award2002HathyarGauri Shivalkar2002Chor Machaaye ShorKaajal2002Badhaai Ho BadhaaiRadha/Banto Betty2002Junoon2001IndianAnjali Rajshekar Azad2001Bhalevadivi BasuShilpaHindi title: Sherni Ka Shikaar2001Maduve Agona BaaPreetiKannada2001Preethsod ThappaKannada2000AzadKanaka MahalakshmiTelugu2000DhadkanAnjaliNominated, Filmfare Best Actress Award2000TarkiebPreeti Sharma2000KhushiMacarenaTamil2000JungTara1999JaanwarMamta1999ShoolDancer1999Lal BaadshahLawyer's daughter1998Pardesi BabuChinni Malhotra1998AakroshKomal1997GamblerRitu1997PrithviNeha1997InsaafDivya1997Zameer: The Awakening of a SoulRoma Khurana1997AuzaarPrathna Thakur1997Veedeva Dani BabuTelugu1996Mr. Romeo1996Chhote SarkarSeema1996HimmatNisha1996Sahasa Veerudu Sagara KanyaSonaTelugu1995HathkadiNeha1994Aao Pyaar KarenChhaya1994Main Khiladi Tu AnariMona/Basanti1994AagBijli1993BaazigarSeema ChopraNominated, Filmfare Best Debut Award[edit] TelevisionYearFilmOther notes2007Celebrity Big BrotherHousemate2004Indian IdolGuest Judge[edit] References^ Shilpa Shetty at the Internet Movie Database^ "Will Big Brother boost Shilpa's career?". inhome.rediff.com. http://inhome.rediff.com/movies/2007/jan/18shilpa.htm.
