The Supreme Court today ruled that it will not allow any lawsuits to go ahead, just a few weeks after the government filed a court brief asking that the case be quashed. The court, in an order Monday, is leaving in place the ruling of a federal appeals court that the country and the princes are protected by sovereign immunity, which generally means that foreign countries cant be sued in American courts, reports the Associated Press.Loose Change 9/11 documentary part 1Order: ReorderDuration: 23:39Published: 2006-02-11Uploaded: 2011-01-18Author: NyXpunhttp://wn.com/Loose_Change_9/11_documentary_part_1Email this videoSms this videoI wanna be the very best Like no one ever was To catch them is my real test To train them is my cause I will travel across the land Searching far and wide Each Pokmon to understand The power that's inside Pokmon...it's you and me I know it's my destiny Pokmon...ooh, you're my best friend In a world we must defend Pokmon...a heart so true Our courage will pull us through You teach me, and I'll teach you Pokmon Gotta catch 'em Gotta catch 'em Gotta catch 'em all!

If you live in the New York metropolitan area, know someone who does or happen to travel here, this message is for you! You heard a lot about the plans by the organization known as the Cordoba Initiative to build a Muslim mosque right next to the Ground Zero in the downtown of New York City. They would call it "the Cordoba House", a glass-and-steel building purportedly to serve as a community center. It would house a swimming pool, an auditorium and a basketball court. Sounds cool, right? Wrong! It is an incredibly sad fact that this kind of heartless mockery and horrendous ridicule of the victims of 9/11 could pass "unanimously" through the Community Board's Committee in May of this year. First and foremost and apart from anything else, this plan is immoral, insensitive and demining on its face to thousands of people who died on that day and to many thousands more whose lives will never be the same! But beyond that, putting up this mosque would arguably signify a de facto beginning of the Islamization of this nation! That is when Islam and its traits, the most known of which is Shahriar law, makes its way into our social institutions and ultimately takes over our way of life. And, NO, I am not talking about the peaceful albeit silent Islamic majority. I am talking about the very much loud, militant, murderous, sadistic minority whose fascist ideas subvert the rest of the Islamic world and enslave it to their will <b>...</b>Lady Justice Hallett will ignore 7/7 London bombing facts - Terrorist exercise Peter PowerOrder: ReorderDuration: 3:39Published: 2007-09-06Uploaded: 2011-01-08Author: flowerpunkchiphttp://wn.com/Lady_Justice_Hallett_will_ignore_7/7_London_bombing_facts__Terrorist_exercise_Peter_PowerEmail this videoSms this videowhat's going on here?? Peter Power - exercise, strange suspicious coincidences here, in the snippet of "mind the gap" london bombings documentary with David Shayler. Personally, i don't know what to believe but i do know that again the official story like the 9-11 commission is full of inconsistencies and crucial omissions. And why haven't we had an independant enquiry about the London bombings? The families of victims demand it The man interviewed, Peter Power, is a consultant for a firm, Visor Consultants. Visor does much security work on contract. Power stated that his, yes, mock terror drills were taking place at several of the sames times and places as the actual bombings, and his people suddenly realized it as they were doing their mock work on the morning of the bombings. The implications of Power's statements were dazzling, to say the least, and since then I have received queries about whether this radio interview really took place. I can understand people's shock and doubt, because the importance of Power's remarks opens up a whole new direction in the research of the bombing attack. Also, the media having NEVER mentioned these events since Power's statements make many people very suspicious. But most people are not aware of such events. Similar to 9-11 in which a third building fell that day and almost freefall speed. As Jones and Watson pointed out in their article, the mock-drill- versus-real-event mirrored what happened in the US on 9/11, when mock air <b>...</b>Obama Official: 'Not Enough Money in the World' for All Oil Spill ClaimsOrder: ReorderDuration: 2:14Published: 2010-07-01Uploaded: 2011-01-12Author: IranContraScumDid911http://wn.com/Obama_Official_'Not_Enough_Money_in_the_World'_for_All_Oil_Spill_ClaimsEmail this videoSms this videoThe Obama appointee managing BP's oil spill disaster fund said Wednesday there's "not enough money in the world" to pay all claims and suggested homeowners with plunging property values could lose out. And in another blow to the oil giant, animal welfare groups Wednesday sued BP for burning alive endangered sea turtles as part of its efforts to get rid of the leaking oil. The "not enough money" warning from prominent US lawyer Kenneth Feinberg came as Hurricane Alex disrupted clean-up operations in the Gulf of Mexico and pushed oil deeper into fragile coastal wetlands and once-pristine beaches. About 423 miles (681 kilometers) of American shorelines have now been oiled -- nearly double the amount sullied just two days earlier -- as oil continues to gush into the sea at an alarming rate 10 weeks into the worst environmental disaster in US history. Feinberg, tapped by President Barack Obama to administer the $20 billion claims fund, insisted BP will "pay every eligible claim," but cautioned that many perceived damages may not qualify. "I use that famous example of a restaurant in Boston that says, 'I can't get shrimp from Louisiana, and my menu suffers and my business is off,'" Feinberg told the House of Representatives Committee on Small Business. "Well, no law is going to recognize that claim." Feinberg said he was still sorting out how to deal with indirect claims like hotels that lose bookings because tourists think the beaches are covered in oil, or people who see <b>...</b>Jared Lee Loughner ConspiracyOrder: ReorderDuration: 9:52Published: 2011-01-09Uploaded: 2011-01-18Author: AntiNRAhttp://wn.com/Jared_Lee_Loughner_ConspiracyEmail this videoSms this videoJared Lee Loughner Conspiracy January 9, 2011.

His MySpace page is set to private, yet hundreds claim they got a screenshot of his page before it was taken down. You cannot get a screenshot of a MySpace page that is set to private. And taken down by who? I doubt if he had time to take his own page down. I searched Yahoo, Google and other search engines for his MySpace page. Not only is his MySpace page gone, but all the cached pages are missing. Not even the FBI has the power to make the cached pages disappear. Only the military has this power. They used a mental patient to shoot Reagan and another to shoot Oswald or did they?. It is easier for them to use a trained CIA agent to do this shooting. Then use fake FBI agents or police officers, working for the CIA, using blanks to shoot (Clay Duke)and or (Jared Lee Lougher) and fake his death. Or they take him into custody, like they did to Timothy McVeigh, find him guilty of murder and give him the death penalty and fake his death in prison, like they did to the CIA guy who shot Oswald. This is why CIA agents don't use their real names and their names are not available to the public. Their deaths are faked, names are changed and they are given new identities. This is how they got someone to shoot Oswald. The guy who shot Oswald was a CIA agent. How did they get him to shoot Oswald?

Conspiracy films  la Michael Moore were no threat to the 9/11goons - so long as the 9/11 TV broadcasts remained unquestioned.

According to the government, excessive alcohol consumption, often coupled with illegal drug use is responsible for nearly 300000 emergency room visits each year for people under 21. The government is so concerned, they are organizing over 2000 town hall meetings to sound the alarm and raise awareness. Experts' major area of concern is with teens and young adults not stepping in when friends are in trouble. Now, there is a grassroots organization hoping to change that. Not a day goes by when Pat and Lisa McCarthy do not think about their 16-year-old-daughter Danielle and wonder, what if? "They could have called me. I would have come and picked her up in a heartbeat, it would have been so simple. No one would have been in trouble," said Lisa McCarthy. But no one did call, and Danielle died. According to court documents, she had been given ecstasy and asked friends to get her help but was denied. She had a seizure and eventually died at a friend's home. "The morning we found out she had died, we just couldn't understand. We were wondering, how could she have died? And the first thing that came out of my mouth was, 'friends don't let friends die.'," said Pat McCarthy. Unfortunately, that was not always the case. And, unfortunately, Danielle is not the only victim.

The girl's mother faces an additional charge of tampering with evidence. The court hearing took place a half hour before a public memorial service in Springfield, Ore., for Janette Maples. Prosecutors contend Richard and Angela McAnulty murdered Maples and that Angela McAnulty tried to conceal evidence. Their lawyers entered pleas of not guilty on both of their behalfs. Maples was rushed from the family's Howard Avenue home to the hospital Dec. 9 after a 911 caller reported the girl wasn't breathing. Maples was pronounced dead at the hospital. Few details have emerged about what investigators believe happened. In the formal language of the criminal charges, the district attorney alleges the couple "did unlawfully and recklessly cause the death, by neglect and maltreatment, of Jeanette Marie Maples ... in the course of and as a result of intentional maiming and torture of the victim." ~~Tears swelling up in my eyes every night Rain drops fall from heaven Simply a walking disguise in the light Rain drops fall from heaven Wondering when i will be alright Rain drops fall from heaven Growing so weak no energy to fight Rain drops fall from heaven Losing all hope in my mind Rain drops fall from heaven Wishing that i could simply unwind Rain drops fall from heaven <b>...</b>Chapter 155: Three Stories, Three HardshipsOrder: ReorderDuration: 0:37Published: 2009-11-30Uploaded: 2010-08-27Author: MemphisGal94http://wn.com/Chapter_155_Three_Stories,_Three_HardshipsEmail this videoSms this videoI walked to center stage, and smiled at the cheering audience.
