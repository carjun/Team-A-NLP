It's exactly the same principle as applies to public parks.  The public roads are in the public domain, ergo the public (of which I am part) has the right to use them.Now, also because they are public domain, my use of them may conflict with use by others.  Therefore, just as with parks, sidewalks, air, the EM spectrum, and everything else in the public domain, my use of them is constrained by how that use would affect the rights of others to use them.  But those constraints are defined by the right, not the other way around.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topthe other one      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jun-22-06 10:57 AMResponse to Original message4.Ooh thats a can of worms.Legally, it is a privelage.  That is, it is a right that requires a person to meet certain obligations.The state holds all the cards when it comes to driving.  A person must have a license, the car must be inspected, registered, titled and insured.  The state even controls the transfer of automobiles through titleing.  You never really "own" your car, you are merely given title to it.  You cannot transfer your car to another person without the cooperation of the state via the titling process.That said, the energy and automobile industries are considered vital to our economic security.  For that reason the process is very much simplified.  A person only needs the barest of skills to qualify for a license, and unsafe cars are routinely allowed on the roads.So I would say that driving is a privelage that the powers that has such low barriers as to ALMOST be considered a right.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topquestion everything      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jun-22-06 10:57 AMResponse to Original message5.Yes, it isSeveral weeks ago I posted a story about a driver in Orange County, CA, where there are very wide bike lane, killed a cyclist and injured a companion.  The driver apparently was reaching into his glove compartment..  That post generated a heated debate about drivers vs. cyclists, never mind that we are talking about a machine of thousands of pounds vs. a human flesh.These days, when drivers' minds are occupied by million tasks except driving we need to remind drivers that driving should occupy their full attention.  No, it is not like brushing one's teeth where - most of us, at least - just do this by rot, not really concentrating on what we are doing but planning our day ahead or just listening to the radio.It is not just changing channels on the radio or gabbing on the phone or trying to control the kids in the back seat.  It is thinking of other things.So, yes, driving is a privilege that should be taken seriously by drivers, or they should lose that privilege.(You did not think you'd hit a hot button with me on this, right?)Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topelectron_blue      (1000+ posts)Thu Jun-22-06 10:58 AMResponse to Original message6.Privileges can be taken away, rights cannot.

We have as much right to drive on them as we do on our own driveways.  We have the right to move about by driving a motor vehicle just as we have the right to move about by walking, riding a bicycle, a coaster wagon, or an ox cart.I grant that the right to drive must be carefully and cautiously restricted by the state to protect the general public from those who abuse or who might abuse this right.  However, driving remains a right.The driver license issued by the states is merely a certification by the state that the recipient of the license has demonstrated such competence as can be measured by the state in the skills and knowledges needed to operate a vehicle without undue danger to others.To consider this license as a permission slip is to assert that the state has some amorphous reservoir of "privileges" that it may dole out to the deserving or to the favored few.

You have freedom of speech, outside of the odd soap in mouth from mom, since you were born. Most rights can only be taken away with a direct court order, and most of them are temporary at that.Now, driving is different, if you fail the driver's exam, you can't drive a car on public roads, period. Now, if you already have a driver's license, then many states do require a court order to take said license away, however, they can do so on a PERMANENT basis.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topimandrewmurphy      (15 posts)Fri Jun-30-06 02:28 AMResponse to Original message24.This oneI don't know where it stands today legally, but I believe we ought to simply drop the idea of our personal actions being privliges.

It remains a right, and you don't let someone take away your rights be telling you that they are only privileges.That doesn't mean that this right couldn't be removed from someone who committed a crime.  Heck, we do that (take away rights) all the time to criminals.

I do NOT have to have permission of the state to tool about on my families farm property nor the property of others with permission.  In fact I often drove farm equipment to include trucks and tractors when growing up and well below the "legal" driving age.If I want to drive about on the public roadways then I have to pay a tax.  The state get that tax by fees for drivers licenses, tag and registration fees, safety inspections and other rules of the road.  As a side effect they hopefully improve the abilities and safety of the drivers and equipment.Is it a privilege or right?  Seems to me it is both.  No restrictions on private property, I.E. a right.  Limited access and prior restraint on public roads, I.E. a privilege.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopTenseiga      (100 posts)Sun Jul-23-06 09:09 AMResponse to Original message29.somewhere in the middleto be issued a driver's liscence is privildge granted by the state (and occasionally taken away for reasons regulated by the state) , but you always have the right to apply for said privilidge. This falls in the grey area.Much like you will always have the right to, to use someone else's term, hold title to a car. They can't refuse you the right to title based on immutable factors such as race, sex, etc etc, only based on your ability to buy said title thru cash or approved credit.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptedd      (3 posts)Sun Aug-13-06 03:23 PMResponse to Original message33.The View from CanadaA few years ago the Supreme Court in Canada ruled on a related question.  The case involved someone who's license was revoked when he failed to pay a fine (or perhaps fines).  In Canada, mobility rights are explicit in the Constitution (as well as protected in common law), and the court ruled that this included driving.  Your driver's license can be revoked for a demonstrated lack of competence, but not for an administrative purpose, such as failing to pay fines.My reading of this is that, in Canada, driving is a right.  But, as with other rights, the state places limitations on that right where it impinges on the rights of others.  (I.e., everyone's right of mobility is compromised when an incompetent driver is on the road.)  I think that's a reasonable position.By the way, there is also an argument that, under British common law, the requirement for a driver's license is a violation of a person's mobility rights.  Obviously, that argument has never gained much traction.  But it's interesting to speculate what would transpire if driver's licenses were ruled unconstitutional.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptruebrit71      (1000+ posts)      Sun Aug-13-06 10:45 PMResponse to Original message34.It is a right.

Period.In this democratic society we pay for every service that we recieve.  We pay taxes.  This means that we pay for the up-keep and construction of the roads, road signs, and traffic lights.  We pay for the car that we drive and the insurance, as required by law.  Some of our rights can be revoked or suspended if we are not good citizens.  The right to vote, for a time, is not available for people convicted of a felony.  The right to bear arms is subject to similar restriction.  Should not driving be a right also?  Since we, the tax payers, pay for every aspect of the activity, including safety infractions. I believe that the right to drive should be suspended for saftey infractions and other irresponsibities deemed to be unlawful.Furthermore, I believe we need to be careful and be aware that the state can not and should not serve as our masters.  To say something is a privelege is to say that we are fortunate to have such a choice.  This is our land, and whether by direct or by indirect contributions to the development of our society, we all have a right to be here and move freely within our land.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNikRik      (136 posts)Fri Dec-24-10 11:25 AMResponse to Reply #3637.If its a right ,my rights have been denied !    I have a out of state hold on my driver license from a 1982 DUI ! I was staying in Ill. for awhile and out of work ,I did not even own a car ,however was using someones car. I went downtown in Chicago where the bars stay open and serve till 4:00AM, on my way back to where I was staying I was pulled over and arrested for a DUI. Spending one night in Cook County Prison was enough to know I would never survive a stint in that prison. I left the state and went back to Ca.to train for a job  I never held a Ill. driver license yet they list a Ill. driver lic # on my case, must be the state IC card # I had. I tried a few times to fill out their "out of state hearing" papers which is the size of a novel, and each time it was rejected and no hearing granted. At $50 a pop to have them send me another set(book)of the application its very frustrating. I cannot believe that even though I never drink at all stopped drinking over 16 years ago,never had a accident.The CA. DMV said I can get my CA. license anytime after the out of state hold is lifted. If I get stopped for any reason the car Iam now driving will be impounded at a cost of $2000 to get back after 30 days, plus about a $500 fine for a unlicensed driver ticket.I have two children I must drive to work, yet when talking to Ill.its like talking to brain washed people that just dont care that losing my car would cost me my job and put a family off four in the streets. Is'nt there any limitation on how long Ill. can continue to hold me back from getting my California driving lic ? If I was rich I would of course have my lic, however at a cost of about $5000 hiring a lawyer in Ill.is somthing I cannot afford! When does the punishment end for me in this very old case ?
