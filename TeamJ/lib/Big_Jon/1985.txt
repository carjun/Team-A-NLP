Death of Michael Jackson - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaDeath of Michael JacksonFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation,searchDeath of Michael JacksonJackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, surrounded by barriers and covered with flowers, became a focal point for fans to express grief.LocationHolmby Hills, Los Angeles, California, United StatesDateJune 25, 2009(2009-06-25)ResultPersonal physician pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charge, proceedings pending.On June 25, 2009, American singer Michael Jackson died after he suffered cardiac arrest at his home in the Holmby Hills neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. His personal physician, Conrad Murray, said he found Jackson in his room, not breathing but with a faint pulse, and that he administered CPR to no avail. Jackson was treated by paramedics at his home, but was pronounced dead at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.[1] While initial reports discussed the possible role of painkillers in Jackson's death,[1][2] attention later turned to the medications he reportedly took for insomnia, most notably the anesthetic propofol (Diprivan).On August 28, 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner declared Jackson's death a homicide caused by the combination of drugs in his body.[3] Before his death, Jackson reportedly had been administered propofol, along with two anti-anxiety benzodiazepines: lorazepam and midazolam.[4] Law enforcement officials investigated Jackson's personal physician, who told investigators that he had been trying to wean him off propofol. On February 8, 2010, Murray pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter, and was released after posting a US$75,000 bail.[5]Jackson's death triggered an outpouring of grief around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and causing sales of his music and that of the Jackson 5 to increase dramatically.[6] Jackson had been scheduled to perform his This Is It concert series to over one million people at London's O2arena, from July 13, 2009 to March 6, 2010.[7] His public memorial service was held on July 7, 2009, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, where he had rehearsed for the London concerts the night before his death. His memorial service was broadcast live around the world, attracting a global audience of up to one billion people.[8] In March 2010, Sony Music Entertainment signed a US$250 million deal with Jackson's estate to retain distribution rights to his recordings until 2017, and to release seven posthumous albums over the decade following his death. His death ranked #1 on VH1/VH1 Classic's list of 100 Most Shocking Moments in Music.Contents1 Circumstances2 Investigation2.1 Autopsies2.2 Law enforcement agencies2.3 Drug-use allegations2.3.1 Propofol2.4 Medical professionals2.4.1 Personal physician3 Health4 Family and legal affairs4.1 Family reaction4.2 Estate5 Public reaction5.1 Media and Internet coverage5.2 Grief5.3 Tributes5.4 Record sales6 Services6.1 Memorial6.2 Burial7 References8 Further reading[edit] CircumstancesJackson's body arrived at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center at 1:14p.m. local time.Jackson arrived for rehearsal at Staples Center around 6:30p.m. on Wednesday, June 24, according to a magician who was there. The singer complained of laryngitis and did not rehearse until 9p.m. "He looked great and had great energy,"[9] the magician added. The rehearsal went past midnight.[9] The next morning Jackson did not come out of his bedroom.[10] According to the attorney of Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician, Murray entered the room in the afternoon and found Jackson in bed and not breathing. Jackson had a weak pulse, and his body was still warm.[2] Murray tried to revive Jackson for five to ten minutes, at which point he realized he needed to call for help. Apparently, Murray was hindered because there was no landline in the house. Murray said that he could not use his cell phone to call 911 because he did not know the exact address. Murray stated that he phoned security, but did not get an answer. Finally Murray ran downstairs, yelled for help, and told a chef to bring security up to the room.[11] By the time security called 911, about 30 minutes had passed.[11] The New York Post said that Jackson's 12-year-old son, Prince Michael Jackson, Jr., was present during the resuscitation attempts, and that the emergency services were contacted only after Jackson's father was told by a security guard on the telephone that the singer was ill.[12]Some statements described Murray using a non-standard CPR technique on Jackson. During the tape of the emergency call, released on June 26, the doctor was described as administering CPR on a bed, not on a hard surface such as a floor, which would be standard practice.[13][14] The doctor's attorney said that Murray placed one hand underneath Jackson and used the other hand for chest compression, where the standard practice is to use both hands for compression.[10][15] A Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson said the 911 call came in at 12:21:04p.m. PST (19:21:04UTC). Paramedics reached Jackson at 12:26p.m. and found that he was not breathing.[16][17]Paramedics performed CPR for 42 minutes at the house.[18] Murray stated that Jackson continued to have a pulse when he was taken out of the house and put in the ambulance for the trip to the hospital.[10] An LAFD official gave a different account, stating that paramedics found Jackson in "full cardiac arrest", and that they did not observe a change in Jackson's status en route to the hospital.[19] LAFD transported Jackson to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.[16] The ambulance arrived at the hospital at approximately 1:14p.m. A team of medical personnel attempted to resuscitate Jackson for more than one hour. They were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at 2:26p.m.[20][21][22][edit] Investigation[edit] AutopsiesJackson's body was flown by helicopter to the Los Angeles Coroner's offices in Lincoln Heights, where on June 26 a three-hour autopsy was performed on behalf of the Los Angeles County Coroner by the chief medical examiner, Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran.[23] Jackson's family arranged for a second autopsy, a practice that could yield expeditedalbeit limitedresults.[24] After the preliminary autopsy was completed, Craig Harvey, chief investigator for the coroner's office, said there was no evidence of trauma or foul play.[25] On August 28, the LA County Coroner made an official statement classifying Jackson's death as a homicide. The county coroner stated that Jackson died from the combination of drugs in his body, with the most significant drugs being the anesthetic propofol and the anxiolytic lorazepam. Less significant drugs found in Jackson's body were midazolam, diazepam, lidocaine and ephedrine. The coroner is keeping the complete toxicology report private, as requested by the police and district attorney.[3] On October 1, the BBC reported that the autopsy report revealed that Jackson was "fairly healthy" for his age and that his heart was strong. The document stated that Jackson's most significant health problem was his chronically inflamed lungs, but this did not contribute to his death.[26] The autopsy stated that he weighed 136 pounds with a height of 5'9". Fox News said that this confirmed rumors that Jackson was emaciated,[27] while the Associated Press stated that his weight was in the acceptable range.[26] The autopsy also revealed that Jackson's arms were covered with punctures and his face and neck were scarred.[28][edit] Law enforcement agenciesAlthough they did not immediately announce that they suspected foul play, by the day after Jackson's death the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) began to investigate the unusual and high-profile case.[29] By August 28, the LAPD had announced that the case would be referred to prosecutors who might file criminal charges.[3] Because the LAPD did not secure Jackson's home, and allowed the Jackson family access to it, before returning to remove certain items, the department raised concerns by some observers that the chain of custody had been broken.[30][31] The police maintained that they had followed protocol.[31] On July 1, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) joined the LAPD in the investigation. Having the authority to investigate issues otherwise protected by doctor-patient confidentiality, the DEA could legally follow the entirety of what appeared to be the complex trail of prescription drugs supplied to Jackson.[30] California Attorney General Jerry Brown announced that his office was helping the LAPD and DEA to create a statewide database of all medical doctors and prescriptions filled.[32]The LAPD subpoenaed medical records from doctors who had treated Jackson. On July 9, William Bratton, the Los Angeles Chief of Police, indicated that investigators were focusing on the possibility of homicide or accidental overdose, but had to wait for the full toxicology reports from the coroner.[33] The Los Angeles Times quoted a senior law enforcement source as saying authorities may not pursue charges even if the coroner declares the case a homicide, because Jackson's well-documented drug abuse would make any prosecution difficult. If charges were filed they would most likely relate to improper prescribing by doctors. Nonetheless, the source said prosecutors had not ruled out more serious charges "all the way up to involuntary manslaughter" if it were determined that Jackson's death was indeed caused by the drug propofol.[34][edit] Drug-use allegationsThe website TMZ, which broke the news of Jackson's death, wrote that Jackson used a number of aliases to secure prescription drugs, including Omar Arnold and Jack London, and the names of one of his bodyguards and an office manager. One doctor would allegedly call the pharmacy to say that Jackson was coming to get Pethidine, and the pharmacy would fill the prescription with the patient's name blank.[35] Jackson was said to have used propofol, as well as alprazolam (an antianxiety agent), and sertraline (an antidepressant).[1] Other drugs named in connection with him included omeprazole, hydrocodone, paroxetine, carisoprodol, and hydromorphone.[36] Police found several drugs in his home, including propofol. Some of these drugs had labels made out to Jackson's pseudonyms, while others were unlabeled.[37] A 2004 police document prepared for the 2005 People v. Jackson child abuse trial alleged that Jackson was taking up to 40 alprazolam pills a night.[33]Deepak Chopra, an internist, endocrinologist, and mindbody theorist who was a friend of Jackson's for 20 years, expressed concern that, although Jackson presumably had access to a large arsenal of drugs, Jackson appears to have been given no naloxone, a drug used to counteract the effects of an opioid overdose.[38] Chopra also criticized what he saw as "enabling" by some Hollywood doctors. "We put drug pushers in jail but give licenses to doctors to do the same thing", he said. "I know personally that they write multiple prescriptions and they even use false names ... This cult of drug-pushing doctors, with their co-dependent relationships with addicted celebrities, must be stopped. Let's hope that Michael's unnecessary death is the call for action."[38]Eugene Aksenoff, a Tokyo-based physician who had treated Michael Jackson or his children on a few occasions, expressed concern about Jackson's use of and interest in various drugs. Aksenoff told The Japan Times that Jackson asked for stimulants so that he could get through some demanding performances. Aksenoff said he refused to prescribe them. He recalled that the singer suffered chronic fatigue, fever, insomnia and other symptoms and took a large amount of drugs. He suspected one of the major factors causing Jackson these symptoms was excessive use of steroids or other skin-whitening medications.[39] People magazine reported that the Jackson family tried to stage an intervention in early 2007, when Michael was living in Las Vegas. Janet Jackson and some of her brothers allegedly traveled to his home, but were turned away by security guards who were ordered not to let them in. He was also rumored to have refused calls from his mother. "If you tried to deal with him," one source told CNN, "he would shut you out. You just wouldn't hear from him for long periods." The family denied that they had tried to intervene.[40][edit] PropofolAn ampoule of propofolOf all the drugs found in Jackson's home, the one that most concerned investigators was propofol (Diprivan), a powerful anesthetic administered intravenously in hospitals to induce anesthesia in preparation for surgery.[41] Nicknamed "milk of amnesia" because of its opaque, milky-like appearance (and a play on words of "milk of magnesia"), the drug has been associated with cardiac arrest,[41] but it still may be increasingly used off-label for anxiolytic and other medically unsubstantiated purposes.[37] Several propofol bottlessome empty, some fullwere found in Jackson's home.[37]On June 30, Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who had worked as Jackson's nutritionist, said that he had asked her in May to provide propofol to help him sleep, but she refused. He told her he had been given the drug before for persistent insomnia, and that a doctor had said it was safe. Lee said she received a telephone call from an aide to Jackson on June 21 to say that Jackson was ill, although she no longer worked for him. She reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She advised the aide to send Jackson to a hospital.[42]Arnold Klein told CNN that Jackson used an anesthesiologist to administer propofol to help him sleep while he was on tour in Germany. CNN said the anesthesiologist would "take him down" at night and "bring him back up" in the morning during the HIStory tour of 1996 to 1997.[40] On August 24, a search warrant affidavit sworn by a Los Angeles detective was made public.[43] The affidavit indicated that authorities were considering a potential manslaughter charge. According to the affidavit, Jackson "was very familiar with" propofol "and referred to it as his 'milk.'"[44] On August 28, the Los Angeles County Coroner made an official statement that Jackson died from the combination of drugs in his body, with propofol and lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, playing the largest role.[3][edit] Medical professionalsThe Los Angeles Times wrote that the DEA was focusing on at least five doctors who prescribed drugs to Jackson, trying to determine whether they had had a "face to face" relationship with him, and whether they had made legally-required diagnoses.[37] Fox News Channel published a list of nine doctors whom they said were under investigation.[45] The UK Sunday Times wrote that the police wanted to question 30 doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, including Arnold Klein.[46] Klein said that he occasionally had given Jackson Pethidine to sedate him, but had administered nothing stronger, and that he had turned his records over to the medical examiner.[47][edit] Personal physicianMurray practiced out of the Armstrong Clinic in Houston. The clinic was raided during an investigation of Murray in July 2009.Cardiologist Conrad Murray joined Jackson's camp in May 2009 as part of Jackson's agreement with AEG Live, the promoter of his London concerts. Murray first met Jackson in Las Vegas when the doctor treated one of the singers children. AEG Live said the singer insisted the company hire Murray to accompany him to England.[48] Murray said through his attorney that he did not prescribe or administer Pethidine or Oxycodone to Jackson, but did not say what, if anything, he did prescribe or administer.[41] Los Angeles police said the doctor spoke to officers immediately after Jackson's death, and during an extensive interview two days later. They stressed that they found "no red flag" and did not suspect foul play.[13] On June 26, police towed away a car used by Murray, stating that it might contain medication or other evidence. The police released the car five days later.[30]Politician and minister Jesse Jackson, a friend of Michael Jackson's family, said that the family was concerned about Murray's role. "They have good reason to be [...] he left the scene."[49] Over the next few weeks, law enforcement grew increasingly concerned about the doctor, and on July 22 detectives searched Murray's medical office and storage unit in Houston, removing items such as a computer and two hard drives, contact lists and a hospital suspension notice.[50] On the 27th, an anonymous source reported that Murray had administered propofol within 24 hours of Jackson's death.[51] Murray's lawyers refused to comment on what they called "rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources."[52] The following day, the ABC News program Nightline reported that investigators had searched Murray's home and office in Las Vegas, and that Murray had become the primary focus of the investigation.[53] On August 11, a Las Vegas pharmacy was searched by investigators looking for evidence regarding Murray, according to an anonymous police source cited by The New York Times.[54] Murray's lawyer advised patience until the toxicology results arrived, noting that "things tend to shake out when all the facts are made known".[53] On February 8, 2010, Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter by prosecutors in Los Angeles. Murray pleaded not guilty and was released after posting $75,000 (USD) bail.[55] Shortly after, the California Medical Board issued an order preventing Murray from administering heavy sedatives.[56] As of June 14, 2010, Murray is allowed to practice medicine in California, while awaiting his trial in the case.[57]A preliminary hearing began on January 4, 2011 to determine whether Murray should stand trial for involuntary manslaughter in the Jackson case. The hearing may last up to two weeks.[58][edit] HealthJackson's death certificate does not indicate the cause of death.Jackson with his three children at Disneyland Paris in June 2006.Further information: Michael Jackson's health and appearanceStacy Brown, a biographer, said Jackson had become "very frail, totally, totally underweight," and that his family had been worried about him. Another biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, who became friends with Jackson in 1970s, said Jackson had suffered from an addiction to painkillers which went on and off for decades.[25] Arnold Klein, Jackson's dermatologist, confirmed that Jackson misused prescription drugs, and that Klein had diagnosed Jackson with vitiligo and lupus. Yet, Klein said, when he saw Jackson at his office three days before his death, the singer "was in very good physical condition. He was dancing for my patients. He was very mentally aware when we saw him and he was in a very good mood."[47] In none of multiple hospitalizations in latest decades, did medics find drugs in Jackson's system.[59][60][edit] Family and legal affairsFurther information: Jackson familyandThe Jackson 5Jackson is survived by his three children, Prince Michael Joseph Jackson (b. 1997); Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson (b. 1998), born during his marriage to his second wife, Debbie Rowe; and Prince Michael Jackson II, known as "Blanket", born in 2002 to a surrogate mother. He is also survived by his brothers, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy; sisters Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet; and parents Joseph and Katherine. Katherine was granted temporary guardianship of Michael's three children on June 29.[61][edit] Family reactionThe Jackson family released a collective statement following the death:Our beloved son, brother and father of three children has gone so unexpectedly, in such a tragic way and much too soon. It leaves us, his family, speechless and devastated to a point, where communication with the outside world seems almost impossible at times.[62]La Toya indicated that the family would file a lawsuit against anyone they believed responsible for her brother's death, as well as push for criminal charges.[63] In 2009, she stated that Jackson might have been administered an ultimately lethal dose of drugs by "a shadowy entourage" of handlers[63] and, in 2010, said that she believed her brother "was murdered for his music catalogue."[64] Shortly after Jackson's death, the family raised questions about the role of AEG Live, the This Is It concert promoter, in the last few weeks of his life.[49] Joseph has since filed a complaint with the California Medical Board alleging that AEG Live was illegally practicing medicine by demanding that Murray get Jackson off of various medications. The complaint also alleges that AEG Live failed to provide the resuscitation equipment and nurse which Murray had requested. AEG spokesman Michael Roth declined to comment on the complaint.[65]After Murray pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge, several members of the Jackson family said they felt he deserved a more severe charge.[66] On June 25, 2010, Joseph filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray. The lawsuit alleges that Murray repeatedly lied to cover up his use of propofol, did not keep sufficient medical records and was negligent in his use of medications on Jackson. Murray's civil attorney, Charles Peckham, denied that Murray gave Jackson anything life-threatening.[67]On September 15, 2010, Panish Shea & Boyle LLP also filed a wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of Michael Jacksons three children and his mother against the Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. (AEG) and its subsidiaries and principals (including Randy Phillips, Kenny Ortega, Paul Gongaware and Thimothy Leiweke).[68] The suit alleges that AEG put their desire for profits from the This Is It Tour over the health and safety of Michael Jackson, ultimately causing his death". Roth declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying that AEG not seen it.[69][edit] EstateFurther information: Value of Sony/ATV Music PublishingJackson's last will was filed by attorney John Branca at the Los Angeles County courthouse on July 1, 2009. Signed July 7, 2002, it names Branca and accountant John McClain as executors; they were confirmed as such by a Los Angeles judge on July 6, 2009.[70] All assets are given to the (pre-existing) Michael Jackson Family Trust (amended March 22, 2002),[71] the details of which have not been made public. The Associated Press reports that, in 2007, Jackson had a net worth of $236.6million: $567.6million in assets, which included Neverland Ranch and his 50% share of Sony/ATV Music Publishing' catalogue, and debts of $331million.[72] The guardianship of his three children is given to his mother, Katherine, or if she is unable or unwilling, to singer Diana Ross.[73] The will states that Jackson's former wife Debbie Rowe was omitted intentionally.[74] Jackson's will allocates 20% of his fortune as well as 20% of money made after death to unspecified charities.[75]Media reports suggested that settlement of Jackson's estate could last many years.[76] The value of Sony/ATV Music Publishing is estimated by Ryan Schinman, chief of Platinum Rye, to be US$1.5billion. Shinman's estimate makes Jackson's share of Sony/ATV worth USD$750million, from which Jackson would have had an annual income of US$80million. Sony Corporation has not commented on whether it intends to buy Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate. Jackson's creditors could force a distressed sale, which would act in Sony's favor since it would lower the sale price, but only if the trust set up by Jackson for his stake in Sony/ATV is revocable. A distressed sale would lower the value of Jackson's estate, and thus might not raise enough to cover the debts owed by the estate.[77][edit] Public reaction[edit] Media and Internet coverageWikipedia spikes at 15:00 hrs in Los Angeles, June 25.The first reports that Jackson had suffered a cardiac arrest, then that he had died, came from TMZ.com, a Los Angeles-based celebrity news website. Doctors at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center pronounced Jackson dead at 2:26pm, and 18 minutes later at 2:44pm. TMZ published: "Michael Jackson passed away today at the age of 50."[17] The Los Angeles Times website confirmed the report at 2:51pm PDT (5:51 p.m. EDT).[78] The news spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down and crash from user overload. Both TMZ and the Los Angeles Times suffered outages.[78] Google initially believed that the input from millions of people searching for "Michael Jackson" meant that the search engine was under attack. Twitter reported a crash, as did Wikipedia at 3:15 p.m.[79] The Wikimedia Foundation reported nearly a million visitors to Jackson's biography within one hour, probably the most visitors in a one-hour period to any article in Wikipedia's history.[80] AOL Instant Messenger went down for 40 minutes. AOL called it a "seminal moment in Internet history", adding, "We've never seen anything like it in terms of scope or depth."[81]Around 15% of Twitter postsor 5,000 tweets per minutereportedly mentioned Jackson after the news broke,[82][83] compared to the 5% recalled as having mentioned the Iranian elections or the flu pandemic that had made headlines earlier in the year.[83] Overall, web traffic ranged from 11% to at least 20% higher than normal.[82][84] MTV and Black Entertainment Television (BET) aired marathons of Jackson's music videos.[85] Jackson specials aired on multiple television stations around the world. The British soap opera EastEnders added a last-minute scene, in which one character discussed the news with another, to the June 26 episode.[86] Whilst all British newspapers printed papers of Jackson in his youth or in his prime, The Sun (for the day after his death) was the only paper to show Jackson from 2009 at his frailest, and keeping to their regular promotion of 'Wacko Jacko.' The next day The Sun fell into course with the rest of the newspapers and Jackson was the topic of every front-page headline in The Sun for about two weeks following his death.[87] During the same period, the three major U.S. networks' evening newscastsABC's World News, CBS Evening News, and NBC Nightly Newsdevoted 34 percent of their broadcast time to him.[88] Magazines including TIME published commemorative editions.[89] A scene that had featured Jackson's sister La Toya was cut from the film Brno out of respect toward Jackson's family.[90]According to an analysis released by the Global Language Monitor, "72 hours after his death, Jackson jumped to the No. 9 spot for the global print and electronic media. For Internet, blogs and social media, Jackson jumped to the No. 2, only trailing the election of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States. The results showed the growing disparity between the mainstream global media, and what is playing out for news on the Internet, and beyond".[91] Paul JJ Payack, president and chief word analyst of GLM said, the death of Michael Jackson has resulted in a global media event of the first order, and added, the fact that he has broken into the top media of the 21st century is a testament to the global impact of the man and his music. Commentators around the globe made connections between Jackson's death and the problems they perceived with everything from the racial dichotomy that Jackson sang about, to the "profoundly tragic figure of Michael Jackson"[92]from American capitalism[93] and globalization, to the fall of the music industry in the 1980s. "Commentators around the world have absolutely flipped", wrote Patrik Etschmayer of Switzerland's Nachrichten newspaper.[94] Le Figaro collumnist Yann Moix said that although Jackson, like his iconic Moonwalk, lived life in reverse, the world at his death shed "identical and universal tears".[95]Michael Okwu of NBC News outside UCLA Medical CenterStatistics published by the Pew Research Center suggested that two out of three Americans believed the coverage of Jackson's death was excessive, while 3% felt it was insufficient.[96] In the UK, the BBC received over 700 complaints from viewers who thought the death dominated the news.[97] On June 29, American conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh said the coverage was "a horrible disgrace" and lent his support to activist-ministers Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, who were fighting to stem the press's speculation about what caused the death.[98] Other conservatives, including commentator Bill O'Reilly[99] and Congressman Peter T. King,[100] also disapproved of the media attention Jackson's death received. Meanwhile, Hugo Chvez, the President of Venezuela, called the pop star's death "lamentable news",[101] but criticized CNN for giving this news more coverage than they gave a coup d'tat taking place in Honduras.[93][101]In August 2009, there were reports that Michael Jackson's family paid social media marketing company uSocial.net to increase the numbers of followers on Jackson's Twitter profile.[102] According to the New York Daily News, uSocial was contracted to deliver 25,000 followers to the account.[103] It was not specified whether the service was rendered before or after his death.[edit] GriefJackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame became a focal point for public grief.Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief. The circumstances and timing of his death were compared to those of Elvis Presley and John Lennon. Fans gathered outside the UCLA Medical Center, Neverland Ranch, his Holmby Hills home, the Hayvenhurst Jackson family home in Encino, the Apollo Theater in New York, and at Hitsville U.S.A., the old Motown headquarters in Detroit where Jackson's career began, now the Motown Museum. Streets around the hospital were blocked off, and across America people left offices and factories to watch the breaking news on television.[104] A small crowd, including the city's mayor, gathered outside his childhood home in Gary, where the flag on city hall was flown at half staff in his honor.[105] Fans also mistakenly gathered around the Hollywood Walk of Fame star of another Michael Jackson, a radio commentator, stating that "they didn't care" when told by reporters[106] (Jackson's own star had been temporarily covered by equipment used for the premiere of the film Brno).[107]Fans around the worldsuch as in Odessa, Ukraine[108] and Brussels, Belgium[109]held their own memorial gatherings. U.S. President Barack Obama sent a letter of condolence to the Jackson family,[13] and the House of Representatives observed a moment of silence.[110] Obama later stated that Jackson "will go down in history as one of our greatest entertainers".[111] Former South African President Nelson Mandela issued a message through his foundation saying Jackson's loss would be felt worldwide.Fans visiting the makeshift memorial set up outside the Neverland Ranch entrance shortly after Jackson's death.In Japan, where Jackson had somewhat of an idol status, the top government spokesman and other ministers expressed their condolences. Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Tsutomu Sato told reporters, "I feel sad as I had watched him since he was a member of Jackson Five." "Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada has credited him with building a generation with his music."[112] "'He was a superstar. It is an extremely tragic loss. But it is fantastic he was able to give so many dreams and so much hope to the people of the world,' said Health Minister Yoichi Masuzoe."[113]British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issue a brief statement on Jackson's death: "This is very sad news for the millions of Michael Jackson fans in Britain and around the world." The Conservative opposition leader, David Cameron, said, "I know Michael Jackson's fans in Britain and around the world will be sad today. Despite the controversies, he was a legendary entertainer."[114]Russian fans gathered outside the U.S. embassy in Moscow to mourn. One told Russia's Novosti newspaper, "This is so difficult! I'm hurt, very hurt!  For us, this is a very great loss. To us, he became a symbol of the spiritual world. It's hard to convey how great a loss this is."[115] France's Minister Culture, Frdric Mitterrand, said, "We all have a Michael Jackson within."[116] Elizabeth Taylor, a long-time friend, said she can't imagine life without him.[117] Liza Minnelli told CBS, "When the autopsy comes, all hell's going to break loose, so thank God we're celebrating him now."[118] His sister La Toya claimed that his daughter said he was being overworked. La Toya is quoted as saying: "She said, 'No, you don't understand. They kept working him and Daddy didn't want that, but they worked him constantly'. I felt so bad."[119][edit] TributesDuring the second leg of Madonna's Sticky & Sweet Tour in June 2009, she and a Jackson impersonator performed a medley of Jackson's songs while photos of Jackson's were shown on a screen behind them.On June 30, 2009, U2 while performing their first show of the U2 360 tour in Barcelona dedicated the song Angel Of Harlem to Jackson. Bono sang verses from Man In The Mirror and Don't Stop Till You Get Enough at the end of the song. On July 10, 2009, 6,000 fans attended a musical tribute in Jackson's hometown of Gary, Indiana. Local performers staged a medley of his songs, and mayor Rudy Clay unveiled a seven-foot memorial to him. Jesse Jackson addressed the crowd, stating, "This is where Michael learned to dance, where he learned to sing, where he learned to sacrifice."[120] The Game, was among the first performers to release a tribute song: his single "Better on the Other Side" came out the day after Jackson's death.

The memorial service was organized by Jackson's concert promoter, AEG Live,[172] who gave away 17,500 free tickets to fans worldwide through an online lottery that attracted over 1.2million applicants in 24 hours,[173] and over a half-billion hits to the webpage.[174] The service was broadcast live around the world, and was believed to have been watched by up to one billion people.[8]Jackson's solid-bronze casket (which reportedly cost twenty five thousand dollars)[46] was placed in front of the stage. Numerous celebrity guests attended the services.[175] His brothers each wore a single, white, sparkling glove, while Stevie Wonder, Mariah Carey, Lionel Richie, Jermaine Jackson and others sang his songs. Jackson's 11-year-old daughter, Paris, broke down as she told the crowd, "Ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine ..."[176] Marlon Jackson said, "Maybe now, Michael, they will leave you alone."[177][edit] BurialMichael Jackson's unmarked tomb at the Forest Lawn Cemetery of Glendale.According to reports, Jackson's burial was originally scheduled for August 29, 2009 (which would have been his 51st birthday).[178] His service and burial was held at Forest Lawn Cemetery of Glendale on September 3, 2009, 10 weeks to the day after his death.[179] The burial was attended by his family members, first wife Lisa Marie Presley as well as his old friends Macaulay Culkin, Eddie Murphy and Elizabeth Taylor, amongst others.[180] The service began with Jackson's three children placing a golden crown on his casket.[180]Jackson's funeral cost one million dollars.[181][182] Cost for the funeral included; $590,000 for Jackson's crypt in Forest Lawn's Great Mausoleum, a vast granite and marble filled palazzo, guest invitations for $11,716.[181][182] The bill for security, including the fleet of luxury cars that delivered Jackson's children, parents and siblings to the ceremony, came to $30,000 and the florist's bill was $16,000, and the funeral planner for $15,000.[181] Howard Weitzman, a lawyer for the estate executors noted that Jackson's family decided on the details of the ceremony, but said a lavish funeral fit the life Jackson lived, commenting, "It was Michael Jackson. He was bigger than life when he was alive."[181][182]Jackson's remains are interred in the Holly Terrace section in the Great Mausoleum. The mausoleum is a secure facility that is not accessible to the general public or to the media, except on an extremely limited basis. The unmarked crypt, which is partially visible at the tinted entrance of the Holly Terrace mausoleum, is covered in flowers fans leave, which are placed by security guards outside the crypt.[179] The family had considered burying Jackson at Neverland Ranch. However, some family members objected to the site, saying that the ranch had been tainted by the sexual abuse allegations.[179] Also, the owners of the ranch would have had to go through a permitting process with county and state government before establishing a cemetery at the site. In July 2010, security was increased at the mausoleum due to vandalism by fans leaving messages in permanent ink.[183][edit] References^ a b c James, Susan Donaldson.
