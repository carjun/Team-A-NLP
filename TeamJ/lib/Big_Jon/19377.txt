Well be careful what you wish for  I had Kosovo, the Middle East, Afghanistan, and 9/11. And then there was the unexpected battle  and the one that I lost  my husbands cancer.So its time I tell his story and mine. So many people have asked me, Whats next?

CeremoniesBy Brian on December 31, 2006 10:45 AMComments from e-mailers about Saturdays Ford coverage: > Katie Couric anchored CBS News live coverage at noon today as Fords casket was moved from the California church to the airport. Neither NBC and ABC carried the events live. > Brian Williams and Chip Reid wont shut up during this funeral procession I had to turn to another channel. > If Bob Schieffer is going to play tutor and grandfather to Katie, you do wonder why he wasnt asked to stay in the big chair. It seems hes her on-air fact-checker. > NBC had amazing coverage going last night with Fords funeral procession, however, it was beyond TACKY when they switched in the middle to the football game at 8pm. (They told viewers to check MSNBC for continuing coverage.) > In changing the channels last night during the President Ford services, the local ABC affiliate in Boston, WCVB-TV5, was preempting the series Ugly Betty. However, just as my wife landed on the station, the shot was a full on close up shot of Betty Ford. Needless to say the info bar underneath the picture was quite the faux pas.CommentsShareNEXT PAGE >>You must have javascript enabled to use these forms.Send an anonymous tipTwitterMobileRSSInterested in advertising on TVNewser?Find a JobResearch Manager, DigitalNational Public RadioWashington, DCResearch Manager, Business and Corporate DevelopmtNational Public RadioWashington, DCAdvertising Sales Representative - Inside SalesPandora Internet Radio - Oakland, CAOakland, CAMarketing Research Analystwww.pandora.comOakland, CASee all jobs | Post a risk-free job listing for $279TVNewser StaffChris AriensManaging EditorAlex WeprinCo-EditorMolly Stark DeanCo-EditorGail ShisterColumnistAlissa KrinskyContributorNadine CheungEditor, The Job PostTVNewser on TwitterTVNewser Twitter feed loading...Follow TVNewser on TwitterTopicsCable News RatingsABCCBSCNNFox NewsMSNBCNBCmore...LinksBroadcasting & CableBuzzMachineFTVLiveInside Cable NewsJohnny Dollar's PlaceMedia DecoderMedia MobMediaiteMonsters & Critics  TVNewsBluesNewscastStudioNewslabRomeneskoThe Live FeedTV BarnTV by the NumbersTVNewsCheckTVSpy WatercoolerTVWeekVarietyZ on TVArchivesJanuary 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010more...
