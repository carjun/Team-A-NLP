His height is 6'6". I may be making a hypothesis here, but is it possible that this funny man owes his career of appearances on just about every sitcom from Seinfeld to The Sarah Silverman Program to the dark lord? Find out for yourself (if you dare) when this comedian takes the stage at Tempe Improv at 8 p.m. I wonder why they didn't schedule him at 6 p.m.For more on Brian Posehn and his upcoming shows at Tempe Improv, read Everybody Loves Nobody by Clay McNear.

Thanks to Heather's Wile Hare, you can do all this with the chance of winning a fair pot of cash. Every Wednesday at 9 p.m., the bar hosts a Wii Bowling tournament with a $5 buy-in.

Well its not the answer I was looking for, but youre right, malt vinegar is a pretty good. Yes, yes mushy peas go pretty well too. You do have a good point about the curry sauceLook, the point I was trying to make is that 80s movies go great with fish and chips. Oh, you dont get it? Well, never mind.

Stephen Lynch did. What better replacement? The producers swapped one comedic song-writing star for another. Neither Lynch nor Sandler will be appearing in tonight's opening show for The Wedding Singer at Gammage Auditorium.  I don't know about you, but I find that a bit relieving. I mean I laughed the first time I heard Sandler's Hanukkah song and I nearly wet myself (with guilt) the first time I heard Lynch's "Special Fred," but with those two out of the mix there's a chance that the lead might actually be someone who can sing. See for yourself tonight at Gammage Auditorium at 7:30p.m. For more on The Wedding Singer see Hail Marry by Robrt Pela.

Face it, your chances for communing with nature are growing slimmer by the second. Before the summer sun banishes you to an air-conditioned existence, take this chance to visit the Desert Botanical Garden.

As musicians go they're extremely talented, but their true genius, I believe, lies not in their skill but in their decision. Think about it: Metallica covers on trombone? That's a bit depressing, isn't it? How about oboe? Interesting, but not quite right. Metallica covers on a theremin? Creepy.Celebrate them for their Metallica covers. Celebrate them for their original songs. Celebrate that they're playing tonight at The Marquee starting at 6:30 p.m. Just don't forget to celebrate their decision to do all of this on cello.

I also understand that hosting the whole shebang is Misty Dawn, a former Playboy Cyber Girl of the week. The truth is Myst is simply trying too hard. I'm headed to Myst tonight for one thing and one thing only: infectious, never-ending bass beats (which judging by the Myst Web site will not be in short supply). After all, bikini-clad beauties and drink specials come and go, but the dance is eternal. Feel the beat for yourself (ear plugs highly recommended) tonight at Myst starting at 11 p.m. Tags:Last Minute  Write Comment Email to Friend Last MinuteLast Minute Tuesday: Pink MartiniBy Jonathan McNamara,                                                            Tue., May 13 2008 @ 12:30AMCategories:                                                                                                                                                            Last Minute By Jonathan McNamaraPhoto by Sherri DitemanPianist Thomas M. Lauderdale wants you to know that the lyrics in Pink Martini's songs are not to be picked apart. In fact, to do so you'd have to know several languages. The band's latest album Hey Eugene! features songs in Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Spanish and a few other languages, as well. So don't worry about what singer China Forbes is "saying" as she emits aural stimulus at the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall Amphitheater tonight.  Instead, focus on what the music is communicating to you. Pink Martini will play the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall Amphitheater tonight starting at 7:30.

Lucky for you, one of those gems merely started this weekend. That's right! If you didn't catch "Gardians of the Camargue: The French Buckaroo Tradition" when it opened at Burton Barr Central Library on Friday, why don't you put things right by wrasslin' up your best hombres and takin' a look-see at this French cowboy exhibition tonight?

Too good to be true you say? Here's the rub: You've got to take off your shirt.

Taking a few cues from his pops, Liam Finn pulls the song-writing thing off with a little bit of ingenuity and technological know-how. Finn runs his sounds through a looping effects pedal, allowing him to back himself up in concert. Where have you heard Liam Finn? He covered "Two of Us" by The Beatles with his father for the I Am Sam soundtrack. Finn's also become part of the reunited Crowded House, but that hasn't stopped him from releasing a solo album, I'll Be Lightning in 2007 or playing The Late Show with David Letterman in February of this year.See Liam Finn tonight at the Rhythm Room.

Reading the write-up for the event should be enough to persuade you, but should you need further proof that what awaits you is a bass-fueled, fabulous night, consider the following. Miller played in a band called Legends featuring Eric Clapton and David Sanborn. Fender produces Miller's signature basses in four and five string versions.

Don't worry, I'll wait. You can tell, right? It's getting hotter. The summer is just around the corner, and that means it's past time to get in swimsuit shape. My suggestion: Sacrifice your normal Thursday activity in favor of something a little more physical. AZ on the Rocks offers rock climbing to the public from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. every Thursday.

No worries, we've got you covered with some potential Wednesday night fun. What the hell, I'll give you two suggestions today. If you're looking for a drink AND a chance to get your nails did, check out Margaritas and Manicures. And dudes, listen up. You know the ladies dig properly maintained cuticles, so don't brush this one off on appearances alone. If you need more to do today, check out  the weekly Rock Band competition at Sandbar Mexican Grill. Don't forget that dressing up like real rockers might net you a prize or two.
