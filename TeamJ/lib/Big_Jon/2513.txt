I thought maybe it was just me so I kept my mouth shut.  I used to love Obama but I am finding it so difficult to like him now.  I think he seems arrogant and the whole "see the light"/preaching thing is a huge turn off for me.  I think my dislike of him started when he had that McClurkin guy (the former gay) with him.  That really ticked me off.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topelixir      (1000+ posts)      Fri Feb-22-08 01:31 PMResponse to Reply #1374.I think we all some the same thing in the Obamas, especially Michelle...a discontent with our country, an anger that overrides the pride we shall all have for the great things our country still provides and represents.When Obama speaks it's almost like he has a difficult task to do and there's nothing good about it, but, darn it, he's going to do it.  You know what, he's damn lucky to have been educated in private institutions - expensive one's at that - and to be able to raise a family and run for public office.  He's not doing us a favor, we're entrusting him with a job and if he gets it he'll be paid handsomely.And Michelle presents an anger that I cannot share.  My family and I have worked hard for everything we've got and would do so again.  Why do we need to awaken the African Americans?  Have they not been participating in elections?I'm going to stop now.  I'm pretty angry about last night and how it's being spun today.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmurbley40      (1000+ posts)      Wed Feb-20-08 09:36 AMResponse to Reply #925.yep  me too.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topfeminazi      (911 posts)Wed Feb-20-08 01:56 AMResponse to Reply #210.I'm with you.I can't vote for the guy.

I got ripped a new one for saying that a lot of his supporters are more like fans of celebrities than supporters of a political candidate, but I believe that. I see the correlation between Obama's fans and the kid who put the video on You-tube crying "leave Britney alone!" It's the same kind of thing, IMO. I cannot support a candidacy that embraces and encourages that kind of blind adoration.This morning, I saw a small article and shared it in this thread: http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.ph... And, I think I have found a new word to describe this phenomenon: Obamincindent ~ The act or occurrence of excessive Obama reverence or adoration.Anyway, I have a very hard time taking him seriously and I will write in Hillary's name if she not the nominee. That will be a first for me in all the years I have been voting and it's very depressing.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJustpat      (1000+ posts)Thu Feb-21-08 04:41 PMResponse to Reply #6467.Hello, fellow Old Broads!

He is so cocky he just assumes all Clinton supporters will flock over to him. Well, this one won't.  I am so angry right now!  His wife is a bitch too.  Arrogant as all Hell. I find it amusing that a lot of DUers think McCain will be such a pushover.   I say, never underestimate him.  A lot of people forget that he is seen right or wrong as a Moderate and a lot of people like him.  Obama has had only softballs thrown at him from Clinton and he can't even handle that.  How is he going to handle the full onslaught of the GOP attack machine?  And how far is the "Hope And Unity" speech going to go before it really gets stale?  In the GE campaign people start listening and a lot of people are going to think   when they keep hearing pretty speeches with no substance in them.Until recently I thought I would hold my nose and vote for him.  The Supreme Court was my ONLY reason.  But now I doubt it.  And you know, I don't even feel confident he will appoint Liberal judges.  Since he likes to reach out so much and to me is so much like Lieberman in that, I wouldn't put it past him to nominate a "Moderate" judge...like Alito.    I am so disgusted right now.  I used to think Democrats were different.  What this primary season has taught me is that this party has a lot of assholes too.

I'm a floridianand as y'all know our vote didn't count in the primary. That was very disheartening. I feel like my constitutional right was taken away in not counting my vote. My state has 210 delegates not including the SD. Florida could be the make or break state for either Obama or Hillary if our votes counted and our delegates seated accordingly. This makes me so sick I don't even feel like voting in the GE. If by some miracle our votes count and delegates are seated I will be pleasantly surprised. However, if we are ignored by the DNC, I will most likely vote but I'll do a write-in for Hillary because I feel she was cheated out of my vote in the primary.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topxmas74      (1000+ posts)      Wed Feb-20-08 08:37 PMResponse to Reply #3940.Quite a few in my area are angry too.Obama won St Louis, KC and Columbia but Hillary won most of the state.

Many of these young girls now want to go back to "traditional values" and talk about the day they marry and become housewives.The backlash is well under way and it's really sad.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topkatty      (1000+ posts)      Fri Feb-22-08 08:47 PMResponse to Reply #8894.well, it has in the U.S., I travel over seas, work and friends &I really see this more with young American women-not in UK, Europe.  Actually, UK and Europeans are always surprised to see young American girls/women acting like pop culture 'nitwits' with no real style as 'women' or the desire to exhibit intelligence, real charm or being 'naturally' feminine/authentic (?!) - including their lousy fashion sense-basically half naked all the time, with out a clue of sophistication. Of course, there are exceptions, but these are the images this country promotes, exports/sells.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topxmas74      (1000+ posts)      Fri Feb-22-08 09:18 PMResponse to Reply #9497.And there is no reason for thatto happen to our young women nowadays.  They are not encouraged to have a thought in their heads-instead, they are expected to show as much skin as possible.They look gaudy and trashy and they have no substance whatsoever.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopBlackVelvet04      (1000+ posts)Sat Feb-23-08 07:11 PMResponse to Reply #97105.We've seen that in some of the avatars on this site.   n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topxmas74      (1000+ posts)      Sat Feb-23-08 09:16 PMResponse to Reply #105108.Unfortunately, this is true.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopBlackVelvet04      (1000+ posts)Fri Feb-22-08 07:41 PMResponse to Reply #8386.I'm afraid they are going to wake up one day and realize that they no longer have the choice of a legal abortion, that birth control is hard to find and forget the emergency morning after pill.  They have no idea what it was like to be told you could be a nurse, secretary, teacher or stewardess....nothing else was open to you.  They have no idea what the sexual harassment in the workplace was like.  They are so foolish and too young and dumb and full of it to know that they don't know.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topxmas74      (1000+ posts)      Fri Feb-22-08 08:02 PMResponse to Reply #8691.I've ten years at the most on a few of these womenand I know full well what sexual harassment in the work place is about.  I remember the Anita Hill jokes.  I remember the pranks pulled on women after that happened.  And I remember driving friends over the state line for abortions.Those poor girls.

It's prevalent throughout society and the sexists that are the most dangerous are the one's that don't know they are sexist....many of which are women.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topxmas74      (1000+ posts)      Fri Feb-22-08 07:51 PMResponse to Reply #8589.Exactly.Women are often their own worst enemies.

If the young kids want to find out what it was like before Roe v Wade they're going to. My mother has been saying that for years. The interest is waning. The horror is just history to many. I am reading Susan Jacoby's book "The Age of American Unreason". We are being dummied down and lazy. I agree with the earlier post that says we are electing presidents like they pick American Idols.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopBlackVelvet04      (1000+ posts)Fri Feb-22-08 09:17 PMResponse to Reply #9396.What they don't seem to realize is that so manyof us are past the age where abortion is an issue for us.  We have continued to fight every encroachment on the right to choose but the younger women are making it tough for us to continue.  They may very well have to find out the hard way, which is sad.  But, good God, some of us are tired.  I have other interests in my life now and I think I've earned the right to enjoy what my husband and I have worked hard to create for ourselves.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topkikiek      (1000+ posts)      Fri Feb-22-08 09:22 PMResponse to Reply #9698.Unfortunately that is the conclusion I have come to also.

They take for granted all that those fights accomplished and denigrate the fight itself.  Sometimes, fighting is all you have left and you damn well better be prepared to do it if you want meaningful change.  The entrenched interests don't give up easily or just because you say you want to reach out to them.Where would we be now if the colonists didn't fight back or MLK didn't fight back or the suffragettes who were jailed and force fed didn't fight back?  Our rights were hard won by women and some men who were beaten, ridiculed, and jailed.Some young women think abortion is set in law and can never be changed.  They think that the glass ceiling is a myth.  They're deluded.
