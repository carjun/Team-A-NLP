He reportedly raped and tortured the men before murdering them.

In other words, Unkefer's side won that round. Unkefer, who often spent time between homes in Scottsdale and southern California, still didn't return our call.Bill FitzGerald, spokesman for the county attorney's office, said a new trial won't be necessary in the case, "just a hearing," which hasn't been scheduled yet by the court.

Say it ain't so!Carlos Mendoza, the justice of the peace who "retired" under questionable circumstances in May 2008, appears to be exploring another run for office.Mendoza filed paperwork in December suggesting that his long dormant campaign-finance committee is again active, according to county records. The paperwork indicates that Mendoza has yet to collect any contributions, but is planning to run for the same office he held between January 2003 and his 2008 "retirement" -- justice of the peace in the Downtown Justice Court.Mendoza didn't return a call for comment Monday.Justices of the Peace, unlike Maricopa County Superior Court judges, are elected. And, unlike superior court judges, they don't even have to be lawyers. (Mendoza, for one, isn't.)But we can't help but imagine that -- even if he technically qualifies for a justice of the peace position -- the Arizona Commission on Judicial Conduct is not going to be happy to see Mendoza's resurrection.

He'sbeen charged with two counts of first-degree murder and child abuse.Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas is seeking the death penalty, but mental-health evaluationscould possibly derail that plan. It looks like this case is headed to a conclusionsimilar to that oflunatic Ed Liu, who was placed in a psychiatric institute earlier this year following the 2005 slayingof two Peoria Walmart workers.Judge Warren Granville of the Maricopa County Superior Court made the latest ruling on Gallegos last week after reviewing two mental-health reports on the murder suspect. Granville ordered the Maricopa County Correctional Health Services department to work up a "restoration regimen" for Gallegos that could last up to 15 months, reports the West Valley View.

The lawsuit notes that although the Wells Fargo branch bank is in a heavily Hispanic area, the manager has managed to either fire or force out every Hispanic who worked there.
