You may pretend that it's a harmless game for kids, but in reality it represents paganism, Satanism, idolatry, witchcraft, and naturalism! Did you know that October 31st is considered by Satanists to be one of their most important days of the year? Beloved, WAKE UP! Don't honor the Devil! Honor God instead by refusing to observe Halloween this year. The Lord Jesus Christ wouldn't dress innocent children up like the devils of Hell and march them around town, so why should you? Are you a TRUE follower of Jesus Christ? Then SKIP Halloween this year and tell others to do likewise!  "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them." (Eph. 5:11)  "The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."

That kind of Protestant will have nothing to do with Catholics, and when they start really getting serious about the precious little theocracy, it will be fun watching them fight over whose version of a theocracy they will have.

The Druids lit fires to ward off the evil spirits.It was also the ending of the Celtic year and when the dead revisitedtheir earthly homes on that evening. In the 9th century All Saints day was changed from May 13th to November the 1st to help convert Scotish and Irish Celts to Christianity Halloween just like Easter and Christmas are NOT Christian celebrations but ones they took over and "converted" Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPaganPreacher      (653 posts)Mon Nov-22-04 01:38 PMResponse to Reply #1923.No, not "lord of the dead."Samhuin/Samhain is not the name of a "lord of the dead." That is Christian crap! The word "Samhuin" literally translates to "summer's end" in Scots Gaelic.Want a source? See: http://www.witchvox.com/holidays/samhain/1031_samhain_h... Samhuin fires also served a practical purpose. Two bonfires were set, herbs were burned on the pyre, and livestock was led between the fires (through the smoke.) The smoke killed parasites, and prepared the animals to be brought into barn or house for the winter (yes, the Celts and earlier Picts kept their farm animals in the house in the winter.)Disclosure: I am a Celtic Pagan, but not a witch or Wiccan.The Pagan PreacherI don't turn the other cheek.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDjinn      (1000+ posts)Mon Nov-22-04 06:15 PMResponse to Reply #2325.Samhainactually is derived from (probably) samhraidhreadh which means summers end but the festival wasn't just about summer's end, The Feast of the Dead(File na Marbh) was held on Samhain and it was the day that the barriers between the dead, the not yet born and the living could mingle.We actually don't know all there is to know about Celtic festivals and Celtic culture in general much of our "knowledge" is no more than a guess, but there was definelty a "death/spirits" connection to Samhain it's just that doesn't mean "evil".There is even conjecture as to whether this actually was a new year/new season festival at all.Modern paganism has made decisions on some areas of Celtic life that archeologists and historians are unable to, for example Samhain doesn't translate to summers end in Scots Gaelic, it may be a abbreviated form of samhraidhreadh but it may just as easilly be something else.Dislosure - Scottish atheist forced to take Gaelic lessons as a kidPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPaganPreacher      (653 posts)Mon Nov-22-04 10:05 PMResponse to Reply #2526.I stand corrected!Thanks for the correction, and the accurate translation. I had based my statement on McBain's Dictionary of Scots Gaelic, which says "samhuinn" means "Hallow-tide", probably orginated with "Sam-fuin (summer's-end)" and is same as the Irish "samhain." I am familiar with some of the tales of the veil between this world and the next, of the thinning of the veil at Samhuin, and of some of the mythological characters who crossed between worlds. I agree with your assessment of the disconnection between the real Celtic cultures and popular Celtic reconstruction. I try to use authentic sources in stuidying Celtic life, and avoid the popular Pagan materials (our Llewellyn Publishing Co. is notorious for publishing falsity and fancy in the name of Paganism.)My source for the story about Samhain fires was an anthropology text I had at university several years ago. It may have been the interpretation of the author on a poorly-understood ancient activity.I have run into the "lord of the dead" story several times (the first time sourced to a popular US Catholic website). Like a hydra, it seems to have many heads, and steadfastly refuses to die out.From what part of Scotland are you? My direct ancestor emigrated from Wigtownshire to Nova Scotia in the 1820s (and not by choice, as I understand it.)The Pagan PreacherI don't turn the other cheek.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDjinn      (1000+ posts)Mon Nov-22-04 10:32 PMResponse to Reply #2627.Edinburgh girl myselfthe Celtic influence is probably more my mums side - she's from Shetland and spoke gaelic until going to school - i still can't understand her when she's on the phone to her mum sometimes even though they speak "english" it's heavilly accented and the gaelic slips in there.Not really that knowledgeble about Celtic culture - just what I've read and it all seems to contradict!

Add in the passage of several centuries, and the influences of other groups that conquered, married into,  or traded with those Celtic tribes, and what we (Americans) think of as "Celtic" becomes a huge mash of different beliefs, practices, and histories. In addition to the romaticized Pagan Celtic stuff, we also have our own American traditions of the Scots-Irish immigrants. Our bluegrass music is directly descended from the ceilidh.I keep the great holidays more fervently than most Christians. For our Samhuin, we built two fires, made music, and greeted our ancestors and lost loved ones. While neighbor kids were running around dressed as pirates and Power Rangers, my son and I kept the fires burning and talked about his ancestors, and mine. It also seemed like the right time to answer the penultimate child's question, "What did you do in the war, Dad?"For Yule, we will have a nice tree, a feast and gifts, and celebrate like kids. I love all the holidays, and celebrate them all!The Pagan PreacherI don't turn the other cheek.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopTaraMoon      (45 posts)Tue Nov-30-04 09:05 PMResponse to Reply #2636.SamhainCattle were led between two fires so that the smoke wouldritually cleanse and/or protect them in much the same waythat various contemporary pagans use smoke (often sage) tocleanse. I seriously doubt that you could get a cow to standstill long enough to be "smoked" to the point ofridding them of parasites.  However, that doesn't rule outthe possibility that they believed that a quick walk throughsmoke would serve that purpose, as well.  But I think weunderestimate ancient peoples' ability to reason. If theparasites were still there after the walk through the smoke,as surely they would be, it's unlikely that they used it forthat purpose.As you probably know but perhaps others don't, November 1stwas the start of the Celtic New Year and it makes absolutesense that there would be a celebration in conjunction withthis. However, the Celts measured days from sundown tosundown so their November first began on what others wouldregard as the eve of October 31.The poster who was forced to study Gaelic was likely given aChristianized interpretation of early Celtic traditions.Christians are soley responsible for attaching their Satan toHallowe'en.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPaganPreacher      (653 posts)Wed Dec-01-04 10:10 AMResponse to Reply #3641.Smoked cows  :-)It's good to talk to you, TaraMoon!Exactly as you say, Christians have attached all notions of Satan to Samhuin/Hallowe'en. Scary that it has been the dominant thought for so long.I also agree that the Celts, and other ancient people, were well-reasoned and practical. That reason and practicality would logically extend into their religion.My theory on the evolution of religious practices in aboriginal cultures is that the "holy" purpose came about because the practice was effective. To apply that to our discussion, the religious use of fire and smoke on livestock (and humans) developed its ritual purpose because there was a tangible benefit to it. Cows and sheep that were smoked would have been healthier through the winter, and the people  assigned a religious reason for that because it worked.The initial practice may have been a long smoking of the animals, which was reduced to a ritual "walk between the fires."Wormwood (Artimisia absinthia) had ritual use, to "call the dead," but it is also an effective insecticide. Smoke of Yew leaves (Taxus bacatta) repels flying insects, and was used by the Norse and Celts to communicate with the dead (according to one Norse source, to raise them as well.)Here is a good page for quick reference on herbs:http://www.cauldronfarm.com/herbal/herbal.html The Pagan PreacherI don't turn the other cheek.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopTaraMoon      (45 posts)Thu Dec-02-04 04:06 AMResponse to Reply #4144.Thanks for the link :)Your reasoning regarding the practical efficacy of herbalsmoking evolving into the ritual practice makes sense.

The ancient pagan origins of Hallowe'en have been sodistorted that Hallowe'en has no more to do with Samhain thana carton of eggs has to do with Oestre (pagan origin ofEaster).Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topsangh0      (1000+ posts)Fri Dec-03-04 11:31 AMResponse to Reply #4648.So they are NOT trying to OUTLAW HalloweenEdited on Fri Dec-03-04 11:32 AM by sangh0They're trying to get the celebrations out of schools. Good, because Halloween celebrations don't belong in schools. Even better, it will make the other (non-fundamentalist) Christians resent them, and less likely to support them in the future.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopJackie97      (1000+ posts)Mon Dec-13-04 12:49 PMResponse to Reply #4653.I've been thinking about this....and I really do think that it's different in the schools than in the rest of life. We liberals demand that we not have teachers leading prayer or having Christian gatherings for the whole school that the minorities would be coerced into. That's because it disrupts education; education which is paid for with everybody's tax money (not just fundamentalist and mainstream Christians). We're protecting the minorities by not having this stuff.Likewise, I think it's important to protect the minority fundamentalists or children of fundamentalists in schools. The truth is that fundamentalist kids can become the class targets or be coerced when the school holds Halloween celebrations that clearly would be exclusive of far fundamentalists like themselves and their parents.Just like it's important to protect the minority atheists and Jews or the kids of them who attend a school; it's important to do the same for fundamentalists.The schools need to be a place that are inclusive of everybody and exclusive of nobody. We don't need programs or anything else that can get minorities coerced or harassed into doing something that might go against their beliefs. We don't need something that would disrupt the educational process too much.Schools are meant to be places to learn math, science, foreign language, History, English, and other important subjects. They are not a place of worship, and they are not a place to hold Halloween parties. We would tell fundamentalist parents who want their kids to know their religion to teach it to their kids on their own. Likewise, parents who want a Halloween celebration for their kids need to either throw one of their own or find one of their own. The public schools should not be used for either. Those are educational facilities paid for by everybody's taxpayer money. Therefore, we need to make sure we accomidate everybody (fundamentalists included) in the best way possible.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPaganPreacher      (653 posts)Mon Nov-22-04 01:30 PMResponse to Original message22.Maybe I am missing it,.....but I didn't see the word "outlaw" anywhere in that bit of silliness.

They do not use religious Christmas songs at concerts, call it the winter holiday, say Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas etc.  Many schools also give a spring break instead of an Easter break, and many times the break does not coincide with the Easter Holiday.

He'd just learned the grade school tradition of a party and parade in costume during the last half-hour of class before Halloween night won't happen this year in the Puyallup School District for his two daughters. The superintendent has canceled all Halloween activities. Click here to read more...A letter sent home to parents Wednesday states there will be no observance of Halloween in the entire school district. "We really want to make sure we're using all of our time in the best interest of our students," explained Puyallup School District spokesperson Karen Hansen. Hansen says the superintendent made the decision for three primary reasons. First, Halloween parties and parades waste valuable classroom time. In addition some families can't afford costumes. It's the third reason some Puyallup parents are struggling with. The district says Halloween celebrations and children dressed in Halloween costumes might be offensive to real witches. "Witches with pointy noses and things like that are not respective symbols of the Wiccan religion and so we want to be respectful of that," said Hansen. The Wiccan, or Pagan, religion is growing in the U.S. and there are Wiccan groups in Puyallup. Number eight on the district's guidelines related to holidays and celebrations reads as follows: "Use of derogatory stereotypes is prohibited, such as the traditional image of a witch, which is offensive to members of the Wiccan religion." "I do lots of things that are not revolving around wearing a black outfit and stirring a cauldron," said Wiccan Priestess Cheryl Sulyma-Masson in an interview with ABC News where she explained that Ricans (or Pagan Clergy) celebrate nature, not Satan. A Payslip School District internal email dating from October 2000 warns that "the Wiccan religion is a bona fide religion under the law, and its followers are entitled to all the protections afforded more mainstream religions. Building administrators should not tolerate such inappropriate stereotyping (images such as Witches on flying brooms, stirring cauldrons, casting spells, or with long noses and pointed hats) and instead address them as you would hurtful stereotypes of any other minority." 2004, however, is the first year that the superintendent decided to cite that concern, along with loss of classroom study time and protection for students who can't afford costumes, as motivation for canceling in-school Halloween activities. "They're so worried about being politically correct anymore that we're not allowed to do much of anything," said parent Tonya Reynolds whose daughter attends Maplewood Elementary. "If you don't want costumes, call it a harvest party," said parent Loni Andrews who promises to challenge the ruling at the next school board meeting. "We don't have to take out complete Halloween. We could still do something for our children." To say the policy put families in an uproar is an understatement. It's tradition at Maplewood Elementary for the kids to parade their costumes through each of the classrooms. "The younger children, to come in in their little butterfly costumes or their little clown costumes to me, it's just part of childhood," adds parent Marilyn McCoy. And the kids' reaction? "Oh they're devastated," says parent Karen Harmes. "They're so disappointed, this is a big deal for them." "Yeah it does bother me because I would really like to go around and dress up," said Maplewood 6th grader Grace Macon. "I think it's terrible," added Silas Macon. "I think it just kind of takes away from the little stuff they get to do that's fun at school." Parents are worried about Halloween, or what's now called Harvest Celebration, and about other holidays. "I'm afraid next it will be St Patrick's Day," says parent Katie McCoy. "Can we not wear green? Can I not send cupcakes for my baby's birthday? Where does it end? That is my question." So it's both class time, and respect for real witches. "It's a little bit of both," said Hansen of the study time and religious reasons for canceling Halloween activities. "I don't think you can balance respect with instructional time and we would always be looking to do both. We want to make sure our students are respectful of all religions and all cultures. Hansen also said that the PTA and teachers have been notified that they can hold parties or other Halloween events after the school day is over. Classroom time, however, will not be used for Halloween celebrations. Hansen says concerns about other holidays and parties held in school will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Parents plan to appeal this Halloween ban at the School Board meeting Monday night. But the District says its decision is final.*****It seems that some Pagans objected to Halloween celebrations in schools because they felt it demeaned their traditions.  And the schools respected their feelings.  And really, if you consider Halloween a religious holiday, as many in the Pagan/Wiccan religious tradition do, does it have anymore place in schools then a Christian Holiday?

The last white guy who had the balls to make a joke with the scary "N" word in it as part of his monologue, was George Carlin. I near piss my pants everytime I hear it. I fear that it is white guilt to an extent. The rest is from the Great Wall of P.C... In all honesty political correctness is in my eyes one of the worst things to happen in recent history. Sure it keeps people from offending others, but it keeps them from thinking or speaking freely. No one in this country has a right to not be offended by something. In fact, free speech protects the right to offend. I'm ok with that, as it allows for free thought. And free thought is far more valuable to this nation than hurt feelings.
