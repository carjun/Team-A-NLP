Scripts can make navigation easier and simplify common maintenance tasks. See Help:Javascript for more information.This page describes how to install them, and provides a list of scripts developed for WikiProject User scripts.[edit] InstallingInstallation of user scripts is done in 3 easy steps: locate your personal userscripts page, add the script to it, and bypass your cache. Each step is detailed below.[edit] Log-in and locate your personal userscripts pageFirst, make sure you are logged in. Only logged-in users can install scripts by modifying a personal userscripts page, also known as a ".js" page.Special:MyPage/skin.js will redirect to the ".js" page of the skin you are currently using. This probably is the Vector skin, which has been Wikipedia's default skin since May 13, 2010.If you clicked the "Take me back" link to return to the "old" look and feel of Wikipedia, you probably are using the Monobook skin.Note that many scripts are designed to work on the Vector or Monobook skin. Such scripts might also work in Chick, Simple and MySkin but are less likely to work in Classic, Nostalgia and Cologne Blue. If you use Modern skin, try enabling a special "compatibility" gadget in your preferences.[edit] Add the script to your personal userscripts pageOne way to install a script is to simply copy the whole script code into your skin.js. You will thereafter have your own copy of the script, which will not be updated automatically; you must do it yourself.Importing is a preferred and most popular way to install a userscript. It makes your skin.js more readable and automatically keeps you up to date with script updates and fixes.This is done by adding importScript('full_page_name') or importScript('full_page_name'); //full_page_name to your skin.js.For example, to install Watchlist since script, you add the following line to your monobook.js:importScript('Wikipedia:WikiProject User scripts/Scripts/Watchlist since');If the script is located at a different place and does not have ".js" as file extension, then you can use importScriptURI() function to include it from there like shown in the following examples. Take note of the explicit raw and ctype format option added to the url.importScriptURI('http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=<script>&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript');[edit] Bypass your cacheAs a final step, you need to bypass your cache after installation.To express your thanks to the developer, you may want to add a userbox to your personal page. Feel free to use the predefined {{Userscripts}} userbox.[edit] GadgetsSome userscripts are made into gadgets; you can install them simply by selecting a checkbox in your Preferences.[edit] Some notesNot all scripts are subpages of WikiProject User scripts; many scripts are stored in the userspace of the user who maintains them; check the destination of the links in the list below to see where a script is stored, and use that location as the argument to the importScript function.Note that importing requires the script to have its own page which is entirely valid JavaScript (all explanatory text is /* inside comments */), as most scripts do. If you import a file which is not valid JavaScript, nothing serious is likely to happen, but your JavaScript, and any JavaScript you have below that, will not work. If your browser is set to inform you about JavaScript errors, you will see these errors; otherwise you will see nothing except that the scripts you have tried to add do not work.Last note: if you see "&dontcountme=s" in a userscript URL then this part can be removed. It is no longer needed.[edit] ScriptsScriptSummary[edit] EditingwikEdA full-featured in-browser text editor for Wikipedia edit pages. Works in Firefox, SeaMonkey, Safari, and Google Chrome only. Provides wikicode syntax highlighting, regular expression search and replace, MS Word and HTML to wikicode conversion, on-page Show preview and Show changes, fullscreen editing mode, and single-click fixing of common mistakes. Not compatible with most other editing scripts from this section but often provides the same functionality.HAPPIBased on research published in WikiSym '09 from the GroupLens Research lab, HAPPI is an editing tool that highlights wiki markup based on how that content has survived through the history of an article. Like wikEd, this highlighting is done in the edit pane and can be viewed while you edit. Tested in Firefox, Opera, Safari, Google Chrome and IE8.References segregatorAllows editing an article without the burden of scrolling through citation templates. It temporarily moves the contents of inline ref tags to a separate text box. Tested to work in Firefox, Opera, and Safari. (Internet Explorer is not supported.)QuickEditInline editing of sections in articles (see de:Image:QuickEdit.png)Inline section editorInline section editor  also supports previewing and viewing changes inlineReplaceallows for regexp inline replacing in textboxesedit.regexReplaceSelectively replace regex matches, possibly based on the text of the match. (documentation)edit.autoReplaceMake a standard, configurable set of regular expression based replacements each time you start editing a page, using the interface of regexReplace. (documentation)js/ajaxPreviewShows both preview and changes with Ajax, faster than standard preview/changes buttons. Support for sortable and collapsing code. Configurable buttons can be above or below edit window. Support for accesskeys. Tested in Firefox 1.5, 2 and 3, Opera 9.27 and 9.52, Internet Explorer 6 and 7.Quick PreviewAdds button Quick preview to the edit form. Clicking it will do an AJAX call to update/show the preview. Much faster then regular preview, which requires reloading the whole page, also does not change the cursor position in the edit window, making it easier to continue editing. Unlike InstaView templates, images etc are rendered correctly, also the script is much "lighter" then InstaView. Does not work in Internet Explorer. (documentation)Bracket matcherAdds a 'parse' link that shows a copy of the edit box with matched curly braces highlighted, for help in tracing complex nested expressionsSafe IE edit linksAutomatically changes certain links on edit and preview to open in an external window (or tab) when clicked, since Internet Explorer is bad about caching form dataSplit-screen edit previewMoves the preview window from under the edit form to a resizable pane on the right-hand side of the screen.Keymanweb Virtual KeyboardWeb-based keyboarding tool supporting 300 languages, visible as a toolbar at the top right of the page.Default SummaryCreates a default edit summary, with several specific to certain pages, such as archive and talk pages.Split edit summary boxCreates new text box for the name of the edited section. This way, the browser's autocomplete for edit summary doesn't contain section name and becomes much more useful.[edit] Content editingAdvisorWhen editing an article, suggests fixing common issues with wikitext as you type.AutoEdAutoEd is a highly customizable and reusable script which can automate the making of certain edits. A number of "preset" configurations allow easy use to fix errors with HTML and wikitext, formatting, and unicode characters, although it can easily be customized to fix typos and other errors.dashesFixes hyphens, dashes, and minus signs per MOS:DASH.defaultsortEdits the category links to make use of the new {{DEFAULTSORT:sortkey}} keywordCommon termsIn my experience, there is the general tendency for editors [collectively] to vastly overlink a small number of terms. Most of these common terms are delinked by this script.EngvarBensure spelling in accordance with British English.HotCatEasily add/remove/replace categories on a page, without having to go to the Edit page.LinkFixrAdds a link to the toolbox in edit mode to fix "link typos", e.g., [[Stuff,]] => [[Stuff]],ProveItComprehensive GUI tool for managing references, including adding and editing references, as well as inserting additional citations to pre-existing references. Support for latest Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Internet Explorer. Requires jQuery.
