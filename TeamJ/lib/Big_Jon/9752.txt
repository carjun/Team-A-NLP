According to The Denver Post, California officials are bringing Austin back to campaign against smoking once again.Austin told The Post:"The worse I look, the more impact I have on my audience. If I walked in with a scarf over my neck, it wouldn't send home nearly the impact than if they saw [the hole in my throat]."Los Angeles Times reports that Austin started smoking at 13 and remained a heavy smoker -- averaging two- to three- packs a day -- even after her laryngectomy in 1992. Months after the ad aired, though, Austin stopped.WATCH:Since the state-sponsored advertisement aired, her health has deteriorated. From breast cancer surgery and the removal of intestines to her current battle with stomach cancer and emphysema, Austin has struggled. But she's using that pain to share her story, and has traveled the world to do it.The new ads could shock the public all over again, according to The Post.In one new ad, a young girl preens in front of a mirror, pretending to smoke a cigarette. A computer-generated tracheotomy hole appears on her neck and the commercial fades into Austin telling her story, accentuating her labored breathing and speech.Story continues belowAdvertisement Read more about Austin's message at The Denver Post or visit  Protect the Truth to learn facts about smoking for yourself.

It was a personal decision that was not influenced by anyone but myself (and the lungs of an individual who died of lung cancer). I believe that is the only way to stop smoking; to make a conscious personal decision to quit. However, I agree that some non-smokers are too pushy and abrasive when approaching non-smokers. This can facilitate an us versus them environment that is counter-productive. We all know the consequences of our actions, but nobody likes being told what they can and cannot do.

We all have freedom to choose and I prefer to have the choice. I am not the average smoker - I barely smoke in the first place. I have a cigar in the humidor a year old even. I don't see why we can not all agree to compromise that the business has the final say whether they want to allow smoking or not allow smoking.

They contain fog machine stuff, flavoring, and nicotine (if you choose). Many people find it trivially easy to quit smoking after trying e-cigs, including me. I enjoy it more than I did smoking, and I *loved* smoking.Nicotine is probably bad. Maybe only as bad as caffeine, maybe 2 to 10 times worse. But its affects on health pale in comparison to the affects of smoking. Overeating is probably much more dangerous than nicotine sans smoke.Some benefits:Health!No smell, unless you're using a fruity flavor which is sometimes marginally detectable (and pleasant)No second-hand smokeSome places let you use them indoorsYou get to keep the hand-to-mouth action, "throat hit", and you can blow vapor rings :P(Oh -- don't buy them at a mall kiosk! Try one of the $10 or $20 ones at 7/11, then buy a better one online if you like it. The forum I linked to above is an invaluable resource.)I probably sound like an advertisement, but these things could potentially save *millions* of lives.

Food helps ease that, too. If you can afford it, try massage or acupuncture. Both are proven to change the way your body processes sensory information. They will help your nervous system cope with being so 'exposed' without the nicotine. Meditation/mindfulness can be a less-costly way of helping yourself. Also, watch out for respiratory infections!

As a Menthol smoker, I used sugar free mints when I needed that "rush" in the back of my throat after meals! I definitely chose the patch over Gum, Inhalers, etc. though - so that I did NOT exchange one oral fixation for another!  THAT does not work in my opinion, either!The patch works because you are able to address the Behavioral and Habitual aspects of smoking without being in withdrawal at the same time.    You know - lighting up EVERY TIME you pick up the phone, or get in the car, or after a meal or whatever.

Another option for folks,  I never used a patch however.  I was only trying to convey the fact the nicotine was the drug for me, the delivery method varied, but beating nicotine was the key.  After 72 hours without nicotine, you body starts to decrease the physical cravings.  After 2 months, i now go up to 3-5 hours at a time without a thought or crave.  I have noticed I have more frequent, and more memorable dreams.  I also seem to have deeper emotions, heartier laughs, deeper lows, perhaps due to blood sugar variance or dopamine levels.

I've always thought there was something mysterious and sexy about smoking, generally on television..but the weird thing is, I can't stand them in real life. They smell awful (it always amazed me how they could be in relationships with non-smokers), they start to look older, and it just makes them nasty to be around when they haven't gotten their "fix".

The adverts from people like Debi Austin seem to have no effect. There's a woman who's prominently featured on bus and subway ads who's lost several fingers as a result of capillary damage from smoking--the photos seem to be in every other car of my train. And yet, absent advertisements and with all the media pressure going against it, smoking is 'cool' again among the hipsters.If the anti-smoking ads (especially the graphic ones that Austin is featured in) and the prices aren't keeping kids off tobacco, what's left?

That's not what they want to be. All the real hipster heroes smoke cigarettes and party and drink because that's the lifestyle any "real intellectual" is supposed to lead. It's at least nice to see a growing interest in organic food, whatever the reason, but being young has never been about making healthy decisions or playing it safe, and tobacco companies have done a fantastic job of becoming and remaining a solid staple of that lifestyle.

But there's a practical aspect--i went out canvassing with young people as part of the election, and there are large numbers of smokers. And these were kids whose tobacco habit was costing them more than an hour's pay a DAY (they were getting $9/hour). What do we have to price cigarettes at in order to make a dent in people starting?
