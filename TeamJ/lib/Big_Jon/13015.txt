What many people do not consider,is that grooming is an art that is practiced by most perpetrators ofany kind of abuse, and, I believe, particularly by perpetrators offamily violence. Institutional Grooming Defined and ExplainedIn the context of abuse, grooming refers to actions deliberately undertaken by a perpetrator with the aim of befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a victim. The victim is "prepared" in this way, so they unwittingly allow abusive behavior or exploitation to occur later. The abuser typically befriends or builds a relationship with the victim in order to establish a relationship of trust. Child grooming involves psychological manipulation in the form of positive reinforcement and foot-in-the-door tactics, using activities that are typically legal but later lead to illegal activities. This is done to gain the child's trust as well as the trust of those responsible for the child's well-being. Additionally, a trusting relationship with the family means the child's parents are less likely to believe potential accusations.Although it is a common belief that grooming is most relevant to children, the same or similar psychological processes are used by perpetrators to exploit adults. In the case of adult grooming, the victims family and friends are also manipulated into thinking the perpetrator is a "nice guy" and that he can be trusted.  It is not only a perpetrator's victims that aregroomed (which would be considered emotional abuse), but the victims'family and friends, the perpetrator's own family and friends, and evenpublic servants and medical professionals (in which case it ispurposeful manipulation).The grooming of doctors, nurses, mentalhealth carers, family support workers and other public servants iscalled "Institutional Grooming" and the perpetrator does it for thepurpose of self-preservation.Institutional grooming refers to the manipulation of professionals who have contact with the victim, so that any allegations of abuse made by the victim are doubted or outright disbelieved.The targets of InstitutionalGroomers may include their victim's General Practitioner, psychiatrist,psychologist, child health nurse, pediatrician, carers at a Family DayCare Facility, school teachers, counselors or therapists. The publicservants targeted may be social workers, case workers, investigativeofficers or police officers employed by government departments such asthe Department For Child Protection, the Police's Family ProtectionUnit and the Department for Community Development. When done withenough finesse to be successful, institutional grooming ensures thatany complaints alleged about the perpetrator are either disregardedoutright, doubted and therefore not investigated thoroughly, or ifacted upon, subsequently dismissed in a court of law. Why woulda perpetrator go to such lengths to manipulate people other than theirvictims? Because when their victims, the victims' family and friends,and the public service networks intended to support their victims aregroomed successfully, the investment of all that hard work does not goto waste - the victims are then still available to continue to abuse.Some Thought Provoking Insights into a Victim's RealityThe scary thing about successful institutional grooming is that itsubstantially increases the harm done to the victims, not only becausethe abuse they face continues for longer, but because they lose theirtrust and faith in the world around them, in their family and friends,in the professional people who are meant to protect them, and mosttragically, in themselves. (Image: Andy Newson / FreeDigitalPhotos.net)The things that are said and done tohurt and manipulate a victim only occur behind closed doors, and it canbe very hard to remember exactly what was said or done, where, in whichorder and at what time, when your world feels like it is caving in. Anabuser will jump on this uncertainty to highlight a victim's supposedinsanity or make them seem dishonest, and to shift the focus away fromhis/her own appalling behavior.Once a victim's memories of theabuse, the words said, things done and feelings felt during that abuse,have been twisted and distorted to deny, justify or excuse that abuse,one can understand why the victim begins to feel unsure about whatreally happened. Combine this with the common symptoms of complete andpartial memory blocking and/or memory substitution in victims sufferingfrom even mild cases of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and one can seehow it can all combine to compound a victims confusion and distress,and deter them from objecting or trying to report it the next time ithappens. One can also see how these factors can pervert the course ofJustice.Grooming by Perpetrators of Family ViolenceInthe context of family violence, institutional grooming is done todiscredit the non- perpetrating parent (who is often also a victim),and the effects of successful institutional grooming in thesecircumstances are almost always tragic.  (image by Robert Kraft / www.publicdomainpictures.net)  In best case scenarios, it canensure debilitating emotional trauma and devastating long termconsequences as the perpetrator is free to continue their abuse of boththe child(ren) and the abused parent. In worst case scenarios, theresults can be overwhelming, and may include horrific physical abuse,soul destroying sexual abuse or even premature death of the victim(s).The death of such victim(s) may be due to suicide, manslaughter,murder-suicide or violent murder. The most prevalent and obviousconsequence however, is once again perversion of the course of Justice,and the undeniable failure of the Legal System's purpose. Damned If They Do & Damned If They Don't Forclarification, consider this generalized example: If a mother seekshelp with protecting her children in a situation where emotional andphysical abuse of both herself and her children has already occurred,and/or where there has been inappropriate sexual talk and behavior infront of her children (that may or may not be sexual grooming), and thechildren have displayed signs that indicate possible sexual abuse (thatmay or may not have happened, and may or may not happen in the future),but where the perpetrator is skilled at the art of institutionalgrooming, that mother will often then be subjected to accusations ofparental alienation and of perpetuating feelings of fear in herchildren. Instead of being taken seriously, she finds herself having todefend her actions and her parenting skills, and sometimes may evenfind herself being the one accused of abusing her children. Ifshe seeks legal advice, she is advised not to make an application tothe Family Court because it is likely that any application will resultin 50/50 shared care of the kids. Further more, she is informed thatunder current Family Law, if she makes any allegations of abuse thatcannot be proven, she risks being found guilty of parental alienationand quite possibly faces losing her children to the perpetrator in thelikely event that interim orders would award him full residency, andallow her only a couple of hours of supervised contact per fortnight,while her children are sent to live with their alleged abuser. She mayalso be required to pay the legal costs for both parties.On theother hand, if she does not do anything about seeking help from theauthorities, either because she has circumstantial evidence but nosubstantiated proof, and no other witnesses to testify on her behalf(her own testimony would be considered hearsay, and thereforediscounted), or perhaps because she has been doubted and/orcounter-accused before, then at some point in the future she may findherself being found guilty of neglecting her duty of care to herchildren, and face the prospect of losing her kids to foster care. (image by Peter Griffin, www.publicdomainpictures.net)What Justice?While I have no doubt that there are indeed parents out there who donot put the best interests of their children first, and who are in factguilty of alienating their children against the other parent andperhaps even of fabricating false allegations of abuse, whether forrevenge or some other reason, surely they must be the minority?Wouldn't the majority of parents want to put their kids first?Furthermore, I ask this question: What about the mother who, in spite of herown abuse, subjugation and degradation, somehow finds the strength totrust her own intuition, and manages to intervene beforeher children become the victims of more serious physical abuse ordevastating sexual abuse? Instead of being supported and respected forthe strength she has shown in the face of her adversity, she is insteadvictimized, subdued and humiliated to an even greater extent. Where isthe justice for mothers such as she? Instead she becomes a victim ofthe system, and so do her children. What happened to breaking the Cycleof Abuse?A Society-Sized Cycle? (Image: Gregory Szarkiewicz / FreeDigitalPhotos.net)Has anybody even stopped to think that perhaps the term "cycle ofabuse" now describes a far greater cycle of perpetual dysfunction thansimply the personal relationships between perpetrators and theirvictims, a cycle that in fact occurs and continues on a much largerscale - one that encompasses modern society as a whole? I mean, who ismore likely to be a liar? A victim or their perpetrator?Obviouslythere are exceptions to every rule, but in most cases, what would avictim get out of being a liar? Any parent who has suffered as a victimof family violence, then chosen to speak out against their family'sabuser, and then been consistent in their commitment to the ongoing andendless process of attending appointments with social workers, lawyers,medical professionals, psychologists, counselors, art therapy and grouptherapy sessions (for both themselves and their children), would agreethat the financial costs, physical energy requirements, mental strainand emotional drain of post traumatic abuse times could simply not beworth it. Proactive parents who choose to engage in such aninvolved process, due to their genuine desire to heal their family'swounds, to protect their children from further harm, and to ensure apositive, healthy change in their life circumstances, will have oftenmaintained such efforts for months before the matter is brought beforethe court, and they will have to maintain their efforts for many monthsor even years after the court makes final orders, even if orders arereasonably suitable.In stark contrast, perpetrators who engagein such therapy will almost always only do so after being questionedabout allegations of abuse, or in the weeks and days leading up to acourt hearing. They only do so to preserve their false reputations, andtheir energetic last minute efforts will seldom last more than a fewweeks past the need to be seen as the "poor victim" of a "vengeful" or"jealous" partner, rather than be exposed as the selfish, unrepentantperpetrators of abuse that they are.Morality & Proactive Logic vs Passive IgnoranceIthink that the Family Law Courts and some government departments aremissing the whole point of what is in the best interests of the child.I am not saying that a perpetrator should be guilty until proveninnocent, or punished without sufficient proof, but what is wrong withprotecting our kids BEFORE they become victims? Why should the onlyevidence taken seriously enough to warrant supervised contact besubstantiated proof of past abuse? Surely prevention is better than acure? (Image: renjith krishnan / FreeDigitalPhotos.net)They cannot say that the cost of supervised contact wouldbe too great if they compare it to the long term costs of abuse to oursociety, considering how many victims of child abuse go on to have lifelong psychological problems, alcohol and other substance abuse issues,often grow up to become abusers themselves, or in some cases resort tosuicide.Considerations of a Responsible GovernmentThe purpose of Family Law should be the protection of our children, whoare not yet capable of making their own choices, rather than anyirrationally perceived justice for those adults who have chosen not totake responsibility for the destructive effects of their abusivebehavior, or the unjust persecution of those adults who are trying toshoulder responsibility for both their own and the abusive parentsactions, by trying to fight a losing battle that must be fought if theyare to honor the duty of care they have to their children.It isessential that any reforms implemented as a result of the review of the2006 Family Law Amendments (and any future changes) ensure there are noviolations of the first and foremost Rights of our Children - theirright to be protected from harm, and to live with out fear, in the warm, safe embrace of unconditional love. (Image: renjith krishnan / FreeDigitalPhotos.net)Surelythe Government can see the necessity of making well informed decisionsregarding the specifics of any changes. Hopefully those responsible formaking these decisions will question the effectiveness of a JusticeSystem that only takes into account substantiated proof (scientificfact?) when making judgments that are guided by Laws which have beenbased on inductively reasoned generalizations drawn from theobservation of limited numbers of specific instances (philosophicalopinion?). Even the existence of the many heated debates overAustralian Shared Parenting Laws highlights the fact that thosegeneralizations were a misrepresentation of the prevailing truth.TheLaws that govern the Australian Family Court System need to be decided by usingdeductive reasoning to draw valid, logical conclusions from theoverwhelmingly substantial amount of relevantempirical evidence available, and most people would agree that thosefacts can be easily found in the historically prevalent and devastatinglong term effects observed in children who have witnessed and/orexperienced any kind of abuse. (Image: Salvatore Vuono / FreeDigitalPhotos.net)The proven reliability ofempirical knowledge obtained by making specific, logical and validdeductions based on vast numbers of instances that demonstrate veryclear and consistent long term trends is surely what is required toensure that the changes made to Family Laws are effective. It isessential that once amended, Family Laws consistently achieve theirpurpose of effectively guiding judgments in those cases where in thereis a need to protect children from a risk of probable future abuse butwhere most often there is no proof other than circumstantial evidence,victim testimony and professional opinion based on hearsay. It is theonly viable path to follow if we are to build a Family Law System inwhich Justice will actually serve in the best interests of the child.A Utopian VisionOnceall that is achieved, time will confirm the truth and futuregenerations will prosper from the positive, healthy, and wide spreadevolution of our society. Their enlightenment will ensure that thewondrous gift of human morality will finally manifest in every aspectof society, propelling mankind into the peaceful bliss of a Golden Agefilled with warmth, love and Light! Some statistics on AbuseA survey of 130 abused parents found that 76% of the 148 childrenordered by the courts to have contact with their estranged parent weresaid to have been abused during visits: 10% were sexually abused; 15%were physically assaulted; 26% were abducted or involved in an abductionattempt: 36% were neglected during contact, ...and 62% suffered emotionalharm. Most of these children were under the age of 5 (Radford, Sayer &AMICA, 1999.) Further more: 70% of children living in UK refuges have been abused by their father.(Bowker et al., 1998)79%of women leave their violent partner because the abuse is affectingtheir children or they fear for their children's lives. - Humphreys andThiara (2002)                      "Relationship to perpetrator: Around two-thirds (66%) of men physically assaulted during the last 12 months said that the perpetrator was a stranger. In contrast, women were less likely to be physically assaulted by a stranger (22%) than bysomeone they knew (82%). Almost a third (31%) of women physicallyassaulted said that the perpetrator was a current or previous partner,and37% reported their attacker as being a family member or friend (seeAustralian Social Trends 2007, Women's experience of partner violence).Women were also most likely to be sexually assaulted by someone knownto them (89%), with 29% of those sexually assaulted reporting that theperpetrator was a current or previous partner, and 39% a family memberor friend."                      A study of 200 womens experiences of domestic violence commissionedby Womens Aid, found that 60% of the women had left because theyfeared that they or their children would be killed by the perpetrator.(Humphreys & Thiara, 2002).In the same study, 76% of separated women suffered post-separationviolence. Of these women:- 76% were subjected to continued verbal and emotional abuse;- 41% were subjected to serious threats towards themselves or theirchildren;- 23% were subjected to physical violence;- 6% were subjected to sexual violence;- 36% stated that this violence was ongoing.In addition to this, more than half of those with post-separation childcontact arrangements with an abusive ex-partner continued to haveserious, ongoing problems with this contact (Humphreys and Thiara,2002)MYTH: Children are not being placed at risk by court ordered contact FACT: A recent report stated that there are 'serious concerns that contact isbeing inappropriately ordered in cases where there are establishedrisks' (Hunt and Roberts Child contact with non-resident parents 2004 )42% of all female homicide victims, compared with 4% of male homicidevictims,were killed by current or former partners in England and Wales in theyear 2000/01. This equates to 102 women, an average of 2 women eachweek (Home Office, 2001...).Between 50% and 60% of women mental health service users have experienceddomestic violence, and up to 20% will be experiencing current abuse.(Department of Health, 2003; Bowstead, Janet, 2000; ReSisters, 2002). From April 2000 to June 2001 there were 30,314 offences under theProtection from Harassment Act 1997 in London alone (MetropolitanPolice Service). A study carried out by the Home Office found that morethan a third (41%) of cases brought to ...the courts under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the suspect had previously had an intimaterelationshipwith the complainant. 33% of the suspects were ex-partners, 4% wererelatives, 1% a current partner and 4% were friends. In situationswhere the suspect previously or currently had an intimate relationshipwith the victim, 94% of the suspects were men (Home Office ResearchStudy 203, 2000).Related LinksHow To Do Your Bit To Help Save Abused Children From Dangerous Family LawsI feel we all have a duty of care to these children, and I plead with you all to make their cases heard.

Humbled that my hub has been nominated for Hubnuggets!raisingme7 months ago I have seen what you speak about at work.  My son belonged to a youth organization where an adult caused him extreme heartache.  It took me two years of concentrated effort to have this party removed from the organization because his deception permeated so many levels both inside and out of the group.  In my working my way through this I found that this party had adversely affected the lives of 40 other children before turning his sights on my son.  My motto through the whole ordeal was "He messed with the wrong kid this time."  Other parents told me that I would never be able to work myself high enough up the "chain of command" to get this handled.  Many had tried and failed.  I did not! It also took me three years to get my son back to being himself and getting his life, dreams and goals back on track!  Thank you for bringing attention to this with your well written hub.Nellieanna7 months ago I'd never heard the term "grooming" used this way.  I was expecting it to be about grooming the hair or nails.   This is too horrid to imagine.  As you say - to condition a victim not to object or to comply and all that - and then to condition all who might help her/him in the event that help is sought -- -  well - it's horrible.In my personal experience - looking back at a terribly abusive (largely emotionally) husband, I  realize that he was continuously planting seeds of conditoning to everyone else around us, though his threats alone had subdued me not to seek help from anyone.I'm stunned to realize that it's become such a "big business" almost, reaching into the professions whose entire job is to HELP victims - but instead they're conditioned to help keep them subdued and at the mercy of merciless abusers.WEll - I came here to see what all the praise for this hub is about - and now I DO see it and agree!

I am the mother described in this article.  I'm being dragged through the processes and now heavily scrutinised because of the actions and things that he has done.  Behind closed doors he is constantly an irritable, intolerant, selfish, self-centred, angry, impatient, inconsistent, lazy, arrogant and grandiose individual who is a pathological liar.  However, others who have met him outside and especially when seen with his daughter comment to me, "Oh he does so  love his daddy/daughter time."  "Oh,  it's so wonderful to watch them together" (the latter from her school librarian).  He's been visiting psychologists, psychiatrists, therapist, counsellors, social workers since his teens and he's worked the system out to a tee.  I've had a relationship counsellor say to me, after witnessing his yelling the word "SHIT" at me in counselling, and apparently believing his denials, minimisations and justifications,  tell me after he'd left that she saw "a wonderful man who was trying his best to be the best father he could possibly be".    Errr, yeah right, he accomplishes that by screaming so loudly at his daughter that she curls up in a foetal position on the floor......  But when I report this, he says I'm exaggerating, and he's believed, and I'm not.  I'm not exaggerating at all, if anything I'm minimising.  He also has a knack of fully describing himself and then attributing the whole lot outside of himself, usually on to me.   Any form of denials on my behalf result in me being labelled as defensive, and looked at with suspicion.  When he does it, he's given credibility.  It's unreal.  And he also lives in his own reality that he makes up as he goes along.  He changes his personal history to suit the moment.  He realigns his own history, thus he lives in a present false reality.  It's quite amazing to watch (when you've worked it out), prior to that it's just insane making.All this leaves me gobsmacked.  He has everybody fooled, literally everybody, except for a few members of his family, and of course, me, and his ex (I'd love to find her, as she'd be able to substantiate how arrogant and self-centred to the point of pathology he really is).  And since the sexual grooming of our daughter has started, my parents now really see him for what he is.The only way I can see for those in authority who count to understand and attempt to see what is occuring with these sociopathic abusers, those who should be protecting our children as I am trying to do, is to have a multitude of protective mothers who also deal with these types of covert chronic abusers speak up.  As a lone voice, I'm lost.  The overall focus of the family law reform centres on overt violence, and while that is incredibly important, so is the deviant behaviour of sexual grooming, blaming and shaming our children, and using them as pawns to elicit the emotional and physical needs of their sociopathic parent.Alicia7 months ago These systems and adminitrators need a major overhaul if families are to survive, and children and women are to be protected from abuse!Sugar Lea7 months ago I feel like this article was written for me.Pamela997 months ago This is a very interesting and well written hub about a tough topic.

MM, SL & OWS, I wrote this for people like you and me, to help others understand something that WE don't even understand half the time. There have been times when my ex has said something about me in court and I have just been so unable to comprehend how someone can lie so blatantly for the sole purpose of their "reputation", knowing full well that lie will cause their children endless pain, that I would not even be able to say anything in my own defense. I would just sit their looking like a fool with my mouth open. And then the prick would say something like "you never thought I would tell them about that, did you?" It's absurd, and the fact that the departments and the courts allow it to happen is just ridiculous...sarah (aari's mum)7 months ago Hi there, thanks for putting me onto this. I finished a family law unit at murdoch yesterday and from what I've learnt the amendments have put the victims of abuse in a very dangerous situation. The amendments were supposed to put the bests interests of the child before anything else and there is a presumption that having a close relationship with both parents is central to the child's best interests.Yet, as you've pointed out, the victims - children or other - are encouraged by the legislation to silence any concerns about abuse at the risk of being labelled an 'unfriendly parent' and losing access (all or substantial) and, in doing so, protection of their children. Abuse is extremely difficult to prove. If it's psychological it's almost impossible. If it's physical, usually the injuries are in the past and evidence has disappeared. Most victims are not in a position to document and prepare evidence of abuse for the court because they are in survival mode and their priority is to keep themselves and their children safe.The system needs to allow for allegations to be brought forward and investigated properly by all parties without there being penalties for doing so. Even if this costs money and time it is better than repressing and silencing the abuse.safe-at-last7 months ago Hi SarahI totally agree!I'm actually having lunch soon with a psychologist I have met through a friend, who specializes in brain imaging. I outlined some things I want to discuss with him in an email and he got quite excited about it. The court goes on about a need for proof, so I want to look at how reliable brain imaging is for diagnosing PTSD & Complex PTSD, and also whether it would be reliable in diagnosing sociopathy or psychopathy....Emotional trauma scars the brain (psychiatric injury) but I don't know whether brain imaging can be used to detect this or not. Even so, it might be possible to use it to prove that a victim is not schizophrenic or bi-polar when an abuser says "she's lying and besides, she's crazy..."  or to prove that any anxiety or depression she is suffering from is situational/reactive as opposed to internal (chemical)).Anyway, I'm looking forward to chatting with this guy. He has a lot of involvement with university research etc... and if I can convince him that there is enough evidence that could be used as a basis from which to  develop a strong hypothesis, he may even be able to organize some  studies.I wonder why the court doesn't consider some of the other physiological evidence that proves on-going stress? For instance, when somebody has a major episode of stress in there life, it will often cause  fingernails to form a horizontal ridge (due to growth slowing or stopping?). As the nail grows, the ridge moves towards the tip of the finger, so it does go away  with time, but if there is ongoing trauma, a person can have many ridges across their nails.After you-know-who left, my mum treated me to a manicure and the nail technician could not believe the ridges in my nails. She was even able to tell me the approximate dates that each stress occurred, and the length of time it persisted for, and my mum and I could not believe how accurate she was. She could tell if the period of stress lasted a few days, a week or two, or over a month!Whether the government would go for it or not is a  a different story. After all, it's more about economics for them than anything else, and the shared parenting laws have substantially reduced the costs associated with running the child support agency because, with shared care, neither parent pays CS, so there is less need to chase all the non-paying parents for money whilst paying extra in family benefits to the sole parent....Thanks for your feedback, and I'm stoked you came on hubpages to have a look. I hope you like some of my writing. The one about paranoid ponderings is quite funny, but I guess the rest is all pretty heavy...corneilius4 weeks ago I am a survivor. I have spent 30 years studying the dynamics of abuse, from within the family through to Governance.One this is absolutely clear - that Power Relationships are at the roots of the problem of abuse, and that Power Relationships are not innate, they are not what the new born baby is expecting to meet, and that they are learned.... or taught by Society....Think on this : the article focus's on how abusers use Instituions, by grooming them.... and this is VERY important information to explore...And what it does not mention is that perhaps Abusers RUN those Institutions, and work within them and that is WHY the Institutions are so easily groomed......  that is WHY justice is rarer than punishment.For example a Government may RULE in ways that harm substantial sectors of their own population. The Media will protect the Government, by grooming the facts to suit their perspective.... we all know this to be the case....We all know that the amongst most successful in business and politics and banking are many, many Sociopaths; Tony Blair, Dick Cheny, Charlie Haughy, Maggie Thatcher, Rupert Murdoch - all people whose actions have harmed many people.....They are the kinds of people who built those Institutions inthe first place, all of which emerged out of the Power Relationship Society.The treatment of Irish Survivors by the Irish Government is abusive, as is the treatment of Native Americans, Native Canadians, Native Australians by thier respective Governments.The fact is that ALL abuse takes place in a context, and that context is Power Relationships which in and of itself is the current paradigm of Western Civilisation, and indeed is what is bringing so much harm to peoples lives, be it by environmental degradation, processed foods, marketing aimed at children's developing psyches to groom them for consumerism, War.We will not end abuse in the home until we also end it in our Societal structures - and the key is understanding Power Relationships and knowing how to thwart them and expose them for what they are....corneilius4 weeks ago None of what I have written is to be taken as to give 'excuses' for ANY abuser or abusive behaviour.....Greg_L-W.4 weeks ago From: Greg Lance-WatkinseMail: Greg_L-W (Greg_L-W@BTconnect.com)Tel:      UK: 01291  62 65 62Hi,I have no personal axe to grind other than a lifetime belief, as an activist, in justice.May I suggest you read the documents, reports, letters and facts surrounding Anne Greigs STORIES regarding her daughter and the criminally irresponsible behaviour of Robert Green her publicist.I have studied the material in some detail and PERSONALLY have come to the conclusion that not only are the STORIES unsound but it is clear there is no admissible, valid or substantive evidence that Hollie Greig was EVE sexually abused.I have laid out the documents and the details of how I have arrived at my opinion in some detail at:http://StolenKids-Hollie.blogspot.comTo date no compelling evidence of sexual abuse has ever been led to date and as the police reports state there just isnt sufficient evidence.It is interesting that not one of the alleged perpetrators would seem to have any suspicious background or other allegations yet seemingly a number HAVE crossed Anne Greig at some time!The only defence that has been made to my voicing my genuine and reasoned views has been a tirade of ad hominem attacks and extrapolation of unsound research to act as a character assasination  you may have sufficient experience to appreciate this technique.Obviously who or what I am does not alter the documentation, the reports, the official letters or the facts  were I Ted Bundy, jesus Christ or sequentially sodomising the Mormon Tabarnacle Choir that would NOT alter the facts!!These STORIES are no more nor no less fanciful regardless of who points out the facts.I started exposing paedophelia in the 1960s, campaigned for decriminalisation of homosexuality 50 years ago, was material in exposing the paedophile aspects of Thomas Hamilton & Dunblane, was instrumental of the resignation of Ron Davis Secretary of State for Wales for his perversions, have been instrumental or participant in bringing other cases to Court, exposed a politician for theft & money laundering leading to his 2 year prison sentence etc. etc.May I remind you that guilt is frequently best shown by those who seek to shoot the messenger and the hysteriacal attempts of the likes of Matt Quinn, David Icke, Robert Green, George McKendrick, Belinda McKenzie to lie and distort their stories about me has shown beyond doubt they have no evidence nor ability to provide evidence to back the STORIES surrounding Hollie Greig who I am reliably informed regardless of such attributes that she may have in aspects of communication and determination to please has the natural attributes of a small child.It is interesting that a main plank of the fancifull STORIES is that as a Downs Syndrome child Hollie can not lie  perhaps then someone can explain how she lied to her Mother for supposedly 14 years!My contention is quite clear  there is every evidence of exploitation of these two vulnerable women for gain or revenge by those that abuse Hollie by parading her around studios and meetings like an exibit in a Victorian freak show  surely the days of the exploitation of mental illness and deformity are behind us  but to listen to the gutter broadcasters and their glee in repetition of these STORIES without any due dilligence or clarity of proof it would seem not.Many a sick mind can be seen gathered to berate anyone who dares to seek the truth with the timerity to require FACTS, and valid admissible evidence that can be in some way corroborated or substantiated.Ask yourself why the clamouring to promote this case comes from the gutter and seeks to defame the very authorities that fund many of them! There seem to be some very sick people trying to settle old scores!Frankly I couldnt give a damn what these foolish people say about me I am indebted to no one, beholden to no one and indifferent to the opinions of crack pots save those who seek to exploit me for their own gain.It is interesting that NOT ONE of the nut jobs supporting these fantasies is willing to engage in debate of the facts as clearly they know they can not uphold their fantasies when exposed to open debate and facts  I have offered open debate in public or point by point debate of the facts and their only defence of the scam is to launch ad hominem attacks.Once again may I ask you to act with due dilligence and some professionalism and study the facts  if you bring to the issue any journalistic, deductive ability I can not see how you are able to come to any opinion largely at varience with that I have put forward  but I would be happy to discuss your viewpoint, if that would help arrive at Justice for the defamed.Regards,Greg L-W.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites85safe-at-lastFrom Western Australia62 Followers46 HubsJoined 9 months agoRead more hubs by safe-at-lastContact safe-at-lastFollow safe-at-lastSubscribe to safe-at-last's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk safe-at-last a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsIs Secession Legal Or Illegal?asked by ThePeeDeeWildcat 2 weeks ago2 answersAnswer this questionWill aliens save us from each other?asked by Fire Sprinklers 7 hours ago4 answersAnswer this questionRelated HubsParental Alienationby Nicole NNatural Vs Organic Food - What's the Difference?by Maddie RuudThe National Day of Prayer and other Presidential...by allpurposeguruUnited States Parental Rights Threatenedby Specialk3749The Corporation Of The United States Of America Is It True?...by Reality BytesThe Greek Me (American Gyro)by mtsi1098 Advice and Tips for Women in Relationships ForumTopicRepliesFemale Sexualityposted by Pacal Votan17what are your hopes and dreamsposted by Butta636311Is It Right To Kiss and Take Away Your Brother's Girlfriend?posted by "Clouds Among Us"5Post a new topic37 more topics Tagsviolence sexual abuse physical abuse post traumatic stress disorder family law family court Recommendations  HubPagesabout uslearning centerblogaffiliatesadvertise link to this pagecopyrightCopyright  2011 Hubpages Inc. and respective owners.
