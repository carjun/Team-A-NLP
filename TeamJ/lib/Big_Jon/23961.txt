Why? Because congressional Republicans have chosen to side with the nations millionaires instead of the jobless.They chose to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy as their top priority this lame-duck session and essentially have told workers struggling to find work in an economy with five job hunters for every opening: Tough luck. Happy holidays.Click here for the latest count on the number of jobless workers who have lost their unemployment insurance since Republicanslet the programdie.Before leaving for the Thanksgiving recess, Republicans blocked a move in the U.S. House that would have maintained the extended benefits program through February. On Monday, Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) introduced legislation to maintain the UI lifeline for a full year. But last night, Republicans used Senate rules to block a vote on the bill. Earlier Baucus said:These benefits help millions of Americans put food on the table and roofs over their headspumping money into our economy and helping to create jobs.Continuing the program for a year will provide the certainty our economy and these Americans looking for work need.Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill) claimed the benefit extension would be misguided but the tax cut should be handed over to millionaires no matter what the effect on the nations budget.Today on Capitol Hill, about 100 jobless workers from across the nation will lobby for the one-year extension. They will be joined by AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and other lawmakers. Harkin says:Currently, the national unemployment rate is 9.6 percent. At the current rate, without a reauthorization, we would cut the lifeline that millions of Americans use to stay afloat. Equally importantly, we would endanger our fragile economic recovery by reducing the amount Americans spend on groceries, utilities and other basic needs.Yesterday, in a letter to President Obama and Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, Economic Policy Institute (EPI) President Larry Mishel and 33 other leading economists urged swift action for the good of the economy and the well-being of millions of deserving Americans who depend on them.In a statement with the letter, the economists say maintaining the UI program is:sensible economic policy that will not only assist the unemployed but help maintain spending, overall demand and employment at this critical point in the recovery. Eliminating these benefits, on the other hand, will cause hardship for the long-term unemployed, scale back spending and weaken the economy since unemployment benefits are one of the most effective means available to support overall demand.Click here to sign a petition urging Congress to maintain the UI program for the long-term jobless workers.

(Click on the Boston-arearadio ad above.)The Development Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which is supported by 66 percent of Americans, would allow undocumented students who have lived in the United States for at least five years and have graduated from high school or received a graduate equivalency diploma (GED) to legalize their immigration status by pursuing a college education or serving in the U.S. military.The AFL-CIO Executive Council, at its August meeting, said these childrenwho were brought to this country by their parentshave grown up in the United States, attended local schools and have demonstrated a sustained commitment to succeed in the educational system. But immigration laws provide no avenue for them to become legal residents. Rather than being allowed to continue to excel in college as they have in high school, the council statement said:These promising children will be forced into a job where they will have to either lie about their status, or work off the books. Neither outcome is just, nor is it good for our society.The print ad points out that Republicans are running out of excuses for opposing the DREAM Act, such as calling it a backdoor amnesty. In reality, the bill only deals with legalizing young people who go to college or serve in the armed forces. Recent studies have shown the DREAM Act will both strengthen our economy and benefit our military.The nation cannot afford to lose students like these, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said at a March 2010 press conference:Each year approximately 65,000 undocumented immigrant students graduate from U.S. high schools, often despite economic hardship and language barriers. Unless there is a change in immigration law, these capable and hard-working young people will be relegated to a life in the shadows, unable to achieve their full potentialand thats an outcome our nation can no longer afford.Trumka emphasized that the DREAM Act is a part of broader immigration reform that should also include:Adjustment of status for currently undocumented immigrants;An independent commission to assess and manage future flows, based on labor market shortages that are determined on the basis of actual need;A secure and effective worker authorization mechanism;Rational operational control of the border;Improvement, not expansion, of temporary worker programs, limited to temporary or seasonal, not permanent jobs.Posted:        November 30th, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .

If the economy gets better, Obamas going to get re-elected.And I think some of it is about stopping the economy.But I really dont want to embrace that because I really dont want to think that people weve elected dont want the economy to get back to where it was.Click the video above for the first half of the interview, and click here for part two.Posted:        November 30th, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .

Good health is important to enabling children to do their best in school.AFT has launched a new website, Linking Childrens Health to Education, which provides practical advice to parents on ways to keep their children healthy and at their best in school. Because students wellness affects their ability to perform in school, AFT has made available vital information about illnesses affecting kids.On the site, AFT member Ronnie Moshi says:When my students come to class with health, social or mental issues such as homelessness, hunger, toothaches, they are often not able to pay attention or participate in a meaningful way. Many of their issues rightly take precedence over their educational needs. I have seen students flourish academically soon after their other immediate and important needs are addressed.The site includes resources on child hunger and nutrition, obesity, dental health, mental health, eating disorders, vision and chronic illnesses such as asthma, diabetes and sickle cell anemia. Under each topic, youll find a short discussion of how the health issue affects learning, as well as links to information and experts advice on the best ways to keep your child healthy.For example, in the section on hunger and nutrition, AFT points out that nearly 17 millionalmost one in fourchildren face hunger each day. Their limited access to nutritious food impairs their physical and mental development. The site links to sites with information on ending childhood hunger and providing good nutrition.Check out the website here.Posted:        November 30th, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .

Last week they held informational pickets in Newark, N.J., and Houston, two of Continentals major hubs. The pilots, who are in contract negotiations with the newly merged airline, say management wants to use outsourced 70-seat jets and nonunion pilots on some regional flights from Continental hubs, a practice the union believesviolates the Continental pilots current contract.The pilots of Continental and United are unified on the issue of protecting the jobs of our pilots, and to stop the outsourcing of our flying, said Capt. Jay Pierce, chairman of ALPAs Continental pilots unit.We would hope management isnt attempting to circumvent the bargaining process. It would serve the new United well to establish a productive labor-management relationship, and concentrate on reaching an agreementrather than willingly violate our existing contract by introducing regional jets to markets where Continental pilots should be flying.Capt. Wendy Morse, chairman of the United unit of ALPA, says:Managements concept [of using] outsourcingis based on outdated business models that simply fail to recognize that the business of an airline is to flynot to outsource flying to the lowest bidder or to merely act as a ticket agent.Meanwhile, the crew members at Evergreen Airlines finally are running out of patience and will begin voting Dec. 1 on whether to authorize a strike if talks are not successful. The workers have been locked in negotiations over a new contract for six years. They overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement in August. The crew members have not had a pay raise in six years and no per diem increase since the early 1990s.We certainly want a contract, not a strike, said professional flight engineer William Fink, chairman of the Evergreen ALPA unit.That has been our goal since day one more than six years agobut the new agreement must provide our members with industry-standard wages, work rules and benefits.

This is the first of a series of blogs on the talks.After the acrimonious climate change talks in Copenhagen last December and in Bonn last June, delegates to the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Parties (COP 16) come to the table in Cancun with reduced expectations. The delegates hope these climate talks will result in specific decisions that can serve as stepping stones for the next major meeting on climate change (COP 17) in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2012. In particular, the global union members here in Cancun are focusing on making sure our just transition ideals are included in a final global climate change treaty. A just transition to a green economy means workers would have the right to a voice in their workplace, the freedom to form unions and bargain collectively and access to training on the latest technology. Since December 2009, affiliates of the AFL-CIO and the unions of the ITUC have been lobbying our respective governments to build off those areas of agreement they reached in Copenhagen.The past year has been a roller coaster ride. The talks in Copenhagen showed the practical difficulty of negotiating with 180 countries in public. Two weeks of negotiations stalled. It took an intense day-long meeting of 30 heads of state, including President Obama, to finally agree to the Copenhagen Accord.Many were disappointed that the Copenhagen talks did not result in a full treaty. A small group of countriesBolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Sudanrefused to sign the accord and continue to agitate against it within the United Nations.There was, however, significant progress on some of the most difficult issues during the talks in Copenhagen, including a breakthrough on transparencythe ability to measure, report and verify the status of greenhouse gas emissions.Both in Copenhagen and in Bonn, broad agreement also was reached on the need for the participation of civil society groups such as unions in decision making on climate change and the acceptance of just transition language.Our goal here in Cancun now is to make sure that delegates take the next step and decide to include the agreed-on just transition language in the treaty and the sections related to implementations as well.Posted:        November 30th, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .

DSM members have been on strike since Oct. 4. DSM says orchestra management barely gave bargaining a chance, going instead to the media to mischaracterize a proposal by the musicians.AFT, Bethel Park School District: Last weeks bargaining sessions failed to produce an agreement between the Bethel Park Federation of Teachers/AFT and the school district. Another round of talks is scheduled for Thursday. The teachers are required by state law to return to the classroom Dec. 6 even if there is no deal by that date.NEGOTIATIONS IBEW, City of Vallejo: In California, members of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 2376 voted to approve a contract with the city of Vallejo, which will run through 2012 if approved by the city council tomorrow. The two sides have been in contentious negotiations since mid-2008, just before the city filed for bankruptcy in May of that year.APWU, U.S. Postal Service: The Postal Workers (APWU) and the U.S. Postal Service last week agreed to another contract extension, to Dec. 1, to allow negotiations to continue. APWU represents 220,000 postal workers.TWU, American Airlines: Transport Workers (TWU) and American Airlines will resume negotiations later this month with a federal mediator. These will be the first talks since TWUs maintenance and related members rejected a deal in August.Disclaimer: This information is being provided for your information only.

Says MSHA administrator Joe Main:I have been saying since I arrived at MSHA that the POV system is broken. This screening represents a positive step forward, but it wont be the only step. POV is on MSHAs rulemaking agenda, and there are also statutory changes pending before Congress that would further improve the system.The mines notified by MSHA had an elevated rate of significant and substantial (S&S) violations and have been subject to closure orders, including closure orders for serious issues such as failing to correct violations after MSHA cites them. MSHA has established S&S violation rate-reduction goals for each mine that received a potential POV notification. If they do not meet those reduction targets, the mines will be placed in the POV program. Says Main:Along with impact inspections and injunction actions, POV represents an important enforcement method for MSHA to change the behavior of mine operators who dont take seriously the health and safety of miners.Posted:        November 29th, 2010        under        Disabled Americans,  Health,  Information on Unions,  Resources,  Retirement News,  US NEWS,  Union Opinions,  Union Questions, Problems & Solutions,  Workplace Safety        .
