Last summer, WikiLeaks said it operated on about 150,000 a year.Now, however, the foundation says it has paid about 380,000 in WikiLeaks expenses, with some invoices for the year still unprocessed. Some of that total is for hardware, Internet access and travel, Wau Holland spokesman Hendrik Fulda said. But a big factor in the leap is a recent decision to begin paying salaries to staffThe primary beneficiary of that decisionwhich has been hotly debated within WikiLeaksis Mr. Assange, the controversial founder and public face of WikiLeaks who is currently under house arrest in the U.K., where he faces possible extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual misconduct.So far, the Wau Holland Foundationfounded in 2003 to honor the legacy of the late computer hacker Wau Hollandhas paid more than 100,000 in salaries for 2010, including about 66,000 euros to Mr. Assange, Mr. Fulda said.Mr. Fulda says the WikiLeaks decision to compensate its staffrather than rely on volunteersends nearly a year of internal debate. In order to professionalize its activities, WikiLeaks will now pay key personnel based on a salary structure developed by the environmental activist organization Greenpeace. Under the structure, Greenpeace department heads are paid about 5,500 euros in monthly salary, Mr. Fulda said.The salaries will be paid retroactively to January 2010, Mr. Fulda said. So far, six WikiLeaks staff members have filed invoices requesting compensation, including at least one invoice for just one month of work, Mr. Fulda said. Other former staff members are expected to file for compensation in the coming weeks, he said.Manfred Redelefs, head of the research unit at Greenpeace Germany, declined to comment on the specific pay structure at WikiLeaks but said, Every organization is free to use the Greenpeace pay structure as their model.Another mounting cost for WikiLeaks relates to legal work. Lawyers acting on behalf of WikiLeaks have billed the document-leaking organization for about 30,000 euros in services. Going forward, that could become a much bigger cost for the organization, given that the U.S. has launched several broad investigations in the wake of WikiLeaks release of classified documents, which has angered the U.S. government.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesJulian Assange, lawyers Salaries NOT to be paid by Wikileaks, Salaries to be paid, Swedish request for extridition, The United States Espionage Act, US Criminal Charges, wacked - Jack Ruby style, Wau Holland Foundation, WikileaksRead moreAssange gets to wait and see if the UK will honor a extradition request from Sweden..In Jail..December 14, 2010jamesb1016 commentsLet me see if I have this straight.This guy is under a warrant for rapeA class A felony everyplace on the planet INCLUDING the UKAns some judge wants to send him to a mansion with a electric beeper on his leg???Is he kidding me?This guy just spilled the beans on nation states.WTF shouldnt he just declare the UK criminal justice system bullshit and walk?THIS IS WANTED FOR RAPE!All these people out there shouting about Assange being the second coming should take a reality pill.Julian Assange aint volunteering to go back to Sweden to face the charges..Am I missing something here?***Julian Assange, the jailed founder of the anti-secrecy groupWikiLeaks, was ordered freed on $315,000 bail on Tuesday but remained at least temporarily in custody awaiting a final decision on whether he will be extradited to Sweden over allegations of sexual offenses against two women.Mr. Assange was driven back to Wandsworth Prison in London on Tuesday night, past cheering and whistling supporters and scores of flashbulbs, pending an appeal of the bail ruling by the Swedish authorities, which must be heard at Britains High Court within the next 48 hours.Judge Howard Riddle, presiding over a packed and rapt courtroom at Westminster Magistrates Court in Central London, said that his decision to jail Mr. Assange as a serious flight risk at an initial hearing on Dec. 7 was marginal and that, with conditions, Mr. Assange should now be freed until further proceedings on Jan. 11.Judge Riddle was swayed Tuesday, he told the court, when a friend of Mr. Assange offered to allow him to stay at a lavish country mansion in Sussex, an hour away from London. Mr. Assange, according to conditions the judge laid out, must spend every night at the mansion, Ellingham Hall, a 10-bedroom home on a 650-acre estate owned by Vaughan Smith, the wealthy founder of ajournalists club in London.Geoffrey Robertson, one of Britains most prominent lawyers, who is assisting Mr. Assanges defense team, described it in court as less house arrest, more mansion arrest. But Mr. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian, will also be electronically tagged to track his movements and must agree to curfews  from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Additionally, he will be stripped of his passport and will be required to present himself to the police every evening.Mr. Assange, in a dark blue suit and white shirt, his naturally gray-blond hair growing back through brown dye, had looked pensive during the hearing, his head often resting on his hand. But he smiled at his mother, present in the public gallery, and offered a thumbs-up as he heard the decision.

The charges allege that Assange held one woman down using his body weight to sexually assault her and that he raped another woman while she was sleeping.Yet the media  everyone fromNaomi Wolf andGlenn Beck to bloggers across the internet  is reporting that Assange is being charged with sex by surprise, or some bizarre Swedish law having to do with a condom breaking, not rape. Multiple reports also characterize the sex as consensual.The truth? Theres nothing in Swedish law about sex by surprise or broken condoms. (Heres the penal code, see for yourself.) And despite reports to the contrary, Assanges accusers havealways said that this was not consensual sex.So what are actually very serious charges are being diminished by shoddy reporting and victim-blaming  and it all starts withAOL News. All of the news sources and blogs reporting that the Assange charges are simply sex by surprise citethis piece from Dana Kennedy at AOL News.The international manhunt for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in a sex-crime investigation in Sweden apparently stems from a condom malfunction.Assanges London attorney, Mark Stephens, told AOL News today that Swedish prosecutors told him that Assange is wanted not for allegations of rape, as previously reported, but for something called sex by surprise, which he said involves a fine of 5,000 kronor or about $715.We dont even know what sex by surprise even means, and they havent told us, Stephens said.So you would think that Kennedy,a seasoned reporter, would do some sleuthing into what the law actually is. No such luck. Instead Kennedy goes on to report the really important facts: that one of the accusers is a blond radical feminist who once wrote a treatise on how to take revenge against men.But heres the thing  if you look at that treatise against men, its actually justa blog post that links and translatesan English eHow article that has nothing to do with dudes. So yeah,she didnt write anything  just re-posted a rando article. For that, shes a conniving feminist bitch. Kennedy then goes on to usethe article inThe Daily Mail tabloid  the same one Naomi Wolf used  to outline the rest of the case (stopping along the way to point out the other accuser was wearing a pink sweater, of course).Now, theBBC,The Guardian andThe New York Times (among other reputable news outlets) have all reported the real charges against Assange  the correct information is out thereMore..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Law, Men, Politics, Updates, WomenAOL story, Julian Assange rape charges, The 'condom' story isn't true, WikileaksRead moreWikilaeks Update..Dutch Teenager arrested.December 10, 2010jamesb101No commentsA Dutch teenager is under arrest, suspected of helping to carry out cyber attacks against two major credit card companies that were allegedly masterminded by supporters of WikiLeaks, officials in the Netherlands said Thursday.Police arrested the 16-year-old boy at his home in The Hague late Wednesday and said he admitted being involved in hacking the websites of MasterCard and Visa,The Wall Street Journal reported. Officers seized computers and hard drives in the house.The boy, whose name was not released, will appear in court Friday.Investigators believe he is part of a widespread, loosely coordinated online assault by WikiLeaks supporters against critics of the document-leaking website and its founder, Julian Assange, according to the Journal.On Wednesday, it was reported their targets included prosecutors in Sweden, where Assange faces charges, the Swiss authority that froze the 39-year-old Australians bank account, and MasterCard and Visa, which ended their relationships with WikiLeaksMore.
