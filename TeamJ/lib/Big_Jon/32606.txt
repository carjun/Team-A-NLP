We were to visit the United States Air Force Academy on two different occasions and the photos that I took on those days will reflect differences in the lighting and clouds. Colorado Springs was determined to be the location of the youngest of five United States service academies and the first class of cadets graduated in 1959.    The United States Air Force Academy is one of the top tourist destinations for people visiting Colorado Springs, and after seeing it, I can understand the reasons why.    See all 20 photosPhoto by Peggy W at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, ColoradoU.S. Air Force Song - I heard this often proudly sung by my Dad.A bit of family history...  The Army and what is now known as the Air Force used to be combined.  During World War 2 my Dad who had volunteered for service was attending the U.S. Army's Airborne School at Fort Benning in Georgia. He was learning to become a pilot but suddenly the program that he was enrolled in was terminated. Apparently military experts determined that they already had enough pilots for their immediate needs and thus all of those, including my Dad, had to shift their attention elsewhere. My Dad became a paratrooper. He kidded for all the remaining years of his life that if he could not fly the airplanes, at least he could ride in them one way.  He would have loved to have become a pilot, but providing for his family and a few major obstacles along life's path precluded that from ever occurring.

When it was determined that the flying aspect of the military merited its own branch of the service, the National Security Act of 1947 first brought the Air Force into being.The service academy board was headed by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1950.Congress took action to pass legislation in 1954 to begin construction for this new branch of service and then President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed it into law.I was very interested to read that Charles Lindbergh was on the advisory committee to determine the site for the new service academy. The reason? My Dad's father (who died when my Dad was only 7 years of age) knew Charles Lindbergh personally according to my grandmother. My grandfather was in World War 1 and had flown on those early airplanes...but that is good subject matter for another hub someday.Going Home To Glory: A Memoir of Life with Dwight D.

The lead architect was Walter Netsch of the firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. An interesting use of aluminum was utilized on the exterior of the buildings which might suggest that used on airplanes. The campus buildings overall are of a very sleek and modern design with the amazing chapel as a focal point of interest.  On April 1, 2004, the cadet area was named a National Historic Landmark. www.SOM.com | United States Air Force Academy - Cadet ChapelGives all the dimensions, etc. of this amazing structure.http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Air_Force_Academy_Chapel.htmlAir Force Academy Chapel by Walter Netsch/ SOM architect, at Colorado Springs, Colorado, 1956 to 1962, in the Great Buildings Online.Cadet Chapel U.S. Air Force Academy Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA Photographic Poster Print, 48x64Amazon Price: $169.99On the Wings of Modernism: THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMYAmazon Price: $58.50List Price: $45.00Cadet Chapel U.S. Air Force Academy Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA Photographic Poster Print, 12x16Amazon Price: $29.99Visiting the chapel The Air Force Chapel is an amazing structure as viewed from the outside. Some would describe the exterior as looking like an "accordion" shaped building.Others would interpret it as a grouping of fighter pilot airplanes lined up facing skyward.Be sure and go inside to see where the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish cadets worship.Apparently other arrangements have since been made to meet the religious needs of cadets from other religions, but these photos below show what we viewed on that day in 1999. Amazing Air Force Academy Chapel * Photo by Peggy WProtestant part of the chapel * Photo by Peggy WWhen first walking in to the Air Force Chapel, the largest open space on that level is for the Protestants withaccommodations for about 1,300 of them.The lighting from the stained glass on either side of the folded design going up to the ceiling must offer different arrays of glittering light depending upon the time of day andweather conditions outside. Each person taking a picture probably gets different results because of this. On a lower level there is seating for 500 Catholics and 100 Jewish cadets. Undoubtedly this is a normal statistical ratio of religious preference out of a large group of cadets attending the academy...thus the discrepancy in the amount of seating to accommodate them.The Catholic section of the Chapel at the Air Force Academy Catholic portion of the Air Force chapel * Photo by Peggy WStained glass windows in the Catholic part of the chapel * Photo by Peggy WThe Jewish portion of the Air Force Academy Chapel Jewish portion of the Air Force Academy chapel * Photo by Peggy WJewish portion of the chapel * Photo by Peggy WGolf course on the Air Force Academy grounds * Photo by Peggy WConditions for USAF Academy, CO at 5:53 pm MSTCurrent Conditions:Partly Cloudy, 19 FForecast:Sun - Snow Showers.

There are 18,000 acres ( 73 km ) making up this Air Force Academy campus. Elevation is 7,258 ( 2,212 m ) above sea level. The grounds are extensive and contain 57 athletic fields using up 140 acres on this site. Since all cadets not only have to pass a rigorous physical exam to be admitted to the Air Force Academy but must also enroll in athletics during all four years of their attendance, there is much offered to meet those needs.According to Sports Illustrated, the Air Force Academy is "the most athletic school in the country." You name the type of sport, and it is probably provided there.Their Clune Arena seats 6,000 people.The Peregrine Falcon is the Air Force Academy mascot.

The U.S. Air Force Academy is an accredited institution of higher learning providing undergraduate degrees in a variety of subjects. The primary intent is to graduate commissioned officers to serve in our military for a period of time if not for an entire career.One must be nominated by a member of Congress to be considered for admission and meet high standards intellectually, morally and physically.If accepted, the U.S. government pays the cadets tuition, room and board and even provides a monthly stipend.In return, after graduating, the newly commissioned officer agrees to serve in the armed forces for a set period of time in return for all he/she has been given.According to a U.S. News and World Report, the acceptance rate ofapplicants for the Fall of 2008 was 18.2%. So while it may not be easy to get admitted to the Air Force Academy or the other service institutions, one can be assured that ifone is accepted ,one willexit with a good education and great opportunities that lie ahead.

Yes, I have seen this campus and surrounding area I am a U.S. Air Force Academy graduate! I have visited the Academy as a family member or friend of a cadet. No, but I will check it out if I ever travel that waySee results without votingOne day as my mother and I were driving in to see the Air Force Academy one last time, there were hundreds of bicyclers on the road obviouslyengaging insome sort of marathon. They certainly had gorgeous surroundings in which to bike ride! A place that we visited with great interest is Arnold Hall which is a museum honoring Air Force personnel. It is worth spending some time there. My mother and I were both very much impressed with what we got to see of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs and would highly recommend a visit if one is in that area. Hopefully my photos and the other videos inserted give one an idea of the spacious campus and surroundings that the cadets enjoy while attending that institution.

The other academies, I understand offer degrees in Engineering but not liberal arts. At least not back then. The Air Force, I think, was the romantic adventure in our day. Now all the services have their own air forces, so it gets confusing.The Air Force also seems more laid back than the others. You can tell it when you go to one of their installations. You pictures bring out the more modern and somewhat less formal attitude of the Air Force. Nice hub.Peggy W5 months ago Hi dahoglund,Glad you enjoyed viewing the photos taken while we visited the U.S. Air Force Academy.  It was a definite attraction that my mother and I wanted to see while in Colorado Springs.  I haven't visited any of the other service academies so will take your impression as to the formality.  The wide open spaces of this one in Colorado surrounded by the Rockies makes it such a beautiful site.  Thanks for the first comment.eovery5 months ago I visited there a couple of times.  It is a lovely are.Keep on hubbing!billyaustindillon5 months ago Another great piece of history Peggy - the B-52 was much apart of U.S. history. It is appropriate it is in high altitude in California. The chapel is very futuristic - rated up awesome!Peggy W5 months ago Hello eovery,Since you have visited the U.S. Air Force Academy a couple of times, you know just how lovely it and the surrounding area happens to be in Colorado Springs.  Thanks for affirming our impressions and leaving your comment.Peggy W5 months ago Hi Billy,Am sure you meant to say Colorado instead of California.  Yes...the Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado Springs is certainly futuristic!  Thanks for rating this hub awesome.Mike Lickteig5 months ago I have been to Colorado many times but have never visited the Air Force Academy.  The Chapel(s) are quite beautiful and must surely be inspiring to see in person.  And, of course, the mountains in the background make me long to return to Colorado sometime soon.Thanks for sharing another great series of photos.MikePeggy W5 months ago Hi Mike,As you might imagine, seeing the Air Force Academy Chapel in person is even better than the photos, but as an artist you would know that.  I would highly recommend a visit if you go to Colorado Springs.  Glad you enjoyed the photos.billyaustindillon5 months ago Peggy yes I am not sure what Iw as thinking there - getting area 51 and the air force confused maybe :)Peggy W5 months ago Hi Billy,Doesn't matter.  Your comment about the B-52 was certainly accurate as having been a big part of U.S. aviation history.Micky Dee5 months ago I hit your buttons as always Peggy. It's another beautiful presentation. What a chapel!FCEtier5 months ago That chapel is impressive! Great photos, too!msorensson5 months ago Awesome. Thanks, Peggy!!Candie V5 months ago WooHoo! Finally somewhere I have been! I have a friend and her son went to the academy in the early 80s and we went to visit him (thinking you can just drop in and say howdy to a new recruit).. Well.. uh not quite.  Pre 9/11 you could access the Academy but under the ever watchful eyes of the security.Your pictures don't do the chapel justice.  The grounds are spectacular, but the chapel is breathtaking!!  It's almost impossible for a snap to show the stained glass windows well! (Not that you didn't try, mind you!)Thank you to all who serve!  Support you with my whole heart!  Thank you Peggy!Peggy W5 months ago Hi Micky Dee,Thanks for pushing my buttons.  Ha!  Seriously, I appreciate you reading my hubs like this one about the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, and leaving comments.  I agree with you...that chapel is outstanding!Peggy W5 months ago Hello FCEtier,That chapel on the grounds of the U.S. Air Force Academy certainly makes a statement!  It is amazing to see in person but glad that you can get some idea of what it is like in pictures.  Thanks for the comment.Peggy W5 months ago Hello msorensson,Thanks!  Enjoyed giving people some idea of just how beautiful the setting is at the Air Force Academy.Peggy W5 months ago Hi Candie,Yes, I imagine the security is tighter now after 9/11.  And yes, pictures of the chapel cannot really do justice to the beauty of those stained glass windows or even the overall effect.Your friend's son must have been a great kid to be accepted into the Air Force Academy!  We have some friends whose son is in The Citadel.  He was not only brilliant but was an Eagle Scout among other things. These service academies only take the brightest and best kids!Nice that you got to see the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.  How is your friend's son doing?  Did he make the military a career?E M Smith5 months ago You do get about Peggy :) This looks an interesting place to visitPeggy W5 months ago Hello E M Smith,Looks like more Ethel because of breaking these trip memories into segments.  Can elaborate on each segment more that way instead of just listing what was done on an entire vacation.  I think that it is more interesting that way...at least I hope so.  Yes, the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs is definitely an interesting place to visit.  Thanks for visiting via the Internet!sarovai5 months ago After 11years , really you are good in memory. Thank u for the photos you shared and about your dad's dream to be a Airforce Pilot. Airforce academy is a good place to visit.Peggy W5 months ago Hi sarovai,My memory isn't quite that good!  Ha!  After vacation trips I would immediately put together photo albums with notations of what was done each day.  Would also take daily notes.  Without that source of reference I wouldn't be writing hubs like this.  Happy to hear that you enjoyed this look at the Colorado Springs U.S. Air Force Academy.  Too bad my Dad never got to complete his dream of becoming a pilot.  He never lost his fascination with airplanes.
