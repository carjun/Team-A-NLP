Ive polled thousands of high school history teachers and spoken about the war to audiences across the country, and there is little agreement even on why the South seceded. Was it over slavery? States rights? Tariffs and taxes?As the nation begins to commemorate the anniversaries of the wars various battles  from Fort Sumter to Appomattox  lets first dispense with some of the more prevalent myths about why it all began.1. The South seceded over states rights.Confederate states did claim the right to secede, but no state claimed to be seceding for that right. In fact, Confederates opposed states rights  that is, the right of Northern states not to support slavery.On Dec. 24, 1860, delegates at South Carolinas secession convention adopted a Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union. It noted an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery and protested that Northern states had failed to fulfill their constitutional obligations by interfering with the return of fugitive slaves to bondage. Slavery, not states rights, birthed the Civil War.South Carolina was further upset that New York no longer allowed slavery transit. In the past, if Charleston gentry wanted to spend August in the Hamptons, they could bring their cook along. No longer  and South Carolinas delegates were outraged. In addition, they objected that New England states let black men vote and tolerated abolitionist societies. According to South Carolina, states should not have the right to let their citizens assemble and speak freely when what they said threatened slavery.Other seceding states echoed South Carolina. Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery  the greatest material interest of the world, proclaimed Mississippi in its own secession declaration, passed Jan. 9, 1861. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of the commerce of the earth. . . . A blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization.The Souths opposition to states rights is not surprising. Until the Civil War, Southern presidents and lawmakers had dominated the federal government. The people in power in Washington always oppose states rights. Doing so preserves their own..More from the James Loewen piece.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesDSD @PoliticalDog101, Five Myths of the Civil War, James Loewen, Lincoln, Slavery, The Civil War, To Free the Slaves, To keep the Union, Lies My Teacher Told Me"Read moreThe Conservative Constitution of the United States.DSDJanuary 8, 2011jamesb101No comments[as leaked to Prof. David Cole and published surreptitiously in The Washington Post]We, the Real Americans, in order to form a more God-Fearing Union, establish Justice as we see it, Defeat Health-Care Reform, and Preserve and Protect our Property, our Guns and our Right Not to Pay Taxes, do ordain and establish this Conservative Constitution for the United States of Real America.Article I.

Stop it. Dont go there, trust me. Trust me. Trust me. You will not like the blow-back, I assure you.Palin posted a statement on Facebook around 3 p.m., calling for peace and justice. She did not make any direct reference to the debate over political rhetoric, playing out on her own Facebook page, which drew more than 3,000 comments.My sincere condolences are offered to the family of Rep.

On behalf of Todd and my family, we all pray for the victims and their families, and for peace and justice.Palin, the original Mama Grizzly, had a famous line about how conservatives should not retrench, but instead should reload.How dare people politicize a political assassination!

Every Saturday, between now and the 2012 general election, I intend to put a few moments aside to write just a bit about Presidential politics and the developments of the race. While I am only an amateur pundit and writer, I think it will be interesting to look back on my thoughts every week, several years in the future.Not too much happened on the Presidential front this week. I could talk about various new potential Republican candidates and polls in New Hampshire, and what it might mean for the race, and especially for my preferred candidate Mitt Romney. Congress came into session this week, and a new Republican majority is in place in the House of Representatives. That will mean a lot in regards to our federal government in the next couple of years.But all of this is going to have to wait, at least for a week. The shocking news today out of Tuscon, Arizona surpasses all, and is going to be the biggest story in the country for quite some time.At the time of this posting, we do not know all the details. Arizona Democrat Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is said to be alive and undergoing surgery, but in critical condition. Previously, reports had her murdered, which would have made her the first female American political figure to ever be assassinated. The fact that the Congresswoman is Jewish, as I am, also is something that is weighing heavily on me, as I consider what kind of person might be responsible for such a cowardly act. A federal judge is now also reported shot in the attack. Several others, including members of the Congresswomans staff have been wounded or killed in this tragic act of violence.We will be hearing much in the days ahead about the horrific event, the victims, the suspect or suspects, and the motive. Fingers will be pointed, rhetoric will be heated, and many will sadly attempt to garner political advantage over a crisis situation.I believe all of us should at this time just pray for the recovery of the Congresswoman, the other victims, and also for our country.Coreyhttp://cgpolitics.blogspot.com/2011/01/race-for-white-house-2012.htmlShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Updates, WomenCorey's Weekly Political Post....1/8/11, Corey@PoliticalDog101, Presidential politics and the developments of the raceRead moreTucson shooting Update .18 shot.6 Dead including a US Federal Judge, and 9 year oldRep Giffords is alive.January 8, 2011jamesb10111 comments(Reuters Photo )From an earlier Press conference..18 Shot6 DOAsthe last one died in University Medical CenterUS Federal Judge John Roll is among the deceasedThe suspect is 22 Year old Jared LoughnerA white maleCongresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is out of surgery for a gun shot wound to the head that passed thru.She is sedated.The Hospital will wait 24 hoursBut believes she has a good chance for recovery.The Investigation is being handled by the Pima County Sheriffs Department and the FBI.***From DSD..[Major and minor updates from Arizona:]Arizona Daily Star | Posted: Saturday, January 8, 2011 11:16 am [Mountain Standard Time](someemphasis added by me)U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot point blank in the head on Saturday in a shooting at a northwest side grocery store this morning, but surgeons say they are very optimistic about her recovery.Meanwhile, Gov. Jan Brewers office is confirming federal judge John Roll[nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in 1991 by Pres. Geo. H.W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1991] was among the dead.Sheriffs authorities said there were six dead, including a child, as well as 18 wounded.Giffords, who is in critical condition, is out of surgery at University Medical Center, said Dr. Peter Rhee at University Medical Center.The shooting occurred at a Safeway supermarket where Giffords was holding one of her regular Congress on Your Corner events, which allows her to speak directly with constituents in her district.The gunman has been identified as 22-year-old Jared Loughner, according to the Associated Press.Giffords has held several events since first taking office in January 2007. At one such event in 2009, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell on the supermarket floor.This was her first event since her re-election to a third term in November.Giffords, 40, was talking to a couple in the store when a gunman rushed her, shouting as he fired his weapon.The gunman fired at people in line and got within 4 to 5 feet of the congresswoman, said Mark Kimble, a former Tucson newspaper executive who is now on her staff.The gunman fired at Giffords then ran out, continuing to shoot.Members of Giffords staff were among the wounded. District director Ron Barber remained in surgery, but his life was not expected to be in danger.Individuals at the event tackled the man after the shooting, said Pima County Sheriffs Department Bureau Chief Richard Kastigar.Last March, Giffords Tucson office was vandalized after the House vote overhauling the nations health care system.Giffords had just started the congressional session. She tweeted welcomes to new Republican congressman David Schweikert and had just sponsored legislation, with Republican Congressman Ron Paul, to cut congressional salaries.U.S. Congressman Raul Grijalva, Giffords seatmate from Southern Arizona, said, Its horrific. Its heartbreaking. Its very frightening. I hope she comes out of it. This is not what public service is all about.The heated rhetoric and civil discord creates an environment for something like this to happen.He lamented a series of incidents demonstrating the buildup that leads to something like this, including envelope of white powder sent to his Tucson office as well as a shot fired at his Yuma office.Gabbys contributions were all in the future. Her career was all in the future.Washington D.C. authorities have spoken with his staff to stay put.His family in Tucson now has security, but he doesnt know yet whether he will have a secret service detail in the future.***Backround from DSD.The gunman, who may have come from inside the Safeway, walked up and shot Giffords in the head first.Giffordss Tuscon constituency office was vandalised last March after she voted in favour of Barack Obamas controversial health bill, which has been bitterly opposed by the American right. Giffords had been named as a political campaign target for conservatives in Novembers elections by former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin for her strong support of Obamas reforms. Palin had published a target map on her website using images of gun sights to identify 20 House Democrats, including Giffords, for backing the new health care law. At an event in 2009 which was similar to the one Giffords was holding today, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell to the supermarket floor.Giffords, who was born in Tucson and has two children, took office in January 2007 supporting immigration control, embryonic stem-cell research and the right to abortion. While the motive for todays shooting was not immediately clear, Giffords was one of 10 Democrat members of Congress who were the subject of harassment over their support for the healthcare overhaul. Although a Democrat, Giffords was a strong supporter of the right to bear arms and was re-elected to her third term last November in congressional elections, edging out the Tea Party favourite Jesse Kelly.http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/08/gabrielle-giffords-shot-tucson-arizonaMore Backround for TPL and Daniel G..Quote by Timothy Peter Leal:She married Cmdr.

HasAmerica finally tired of Jersey Shore? The signs are there: book deals, arrests, lawsuits, Angelinas song. As we prep for Season 3, America must ask: Has the shark been jumped? Nahhhh.

Heres the rundown of the Season 3 kickoff.The Good:We meet Deena, Snookis girlfriend from Poughkeepsie and Angelinas replacement on the show. Deena is much like Snooki in that she has the approximate height of an Oompa-Loompa, the drinking proclivities of an Irish longshoreman and the tolerance of those kids on Skins. By episodes end, Deena  much like Snooki in Season 1  has shown her hocoo-ca for all of America to see, in an accidental striptease for The Situation that he vows to keep a secret.
