This upward spiral of reading means we...The Art of MemoryThe building of wider vocabulary is an active exercise inhuman memory. How does one remember a word and the context it is used in? Sometimesthe meaning of the word itself may not be accurate but the context may be understood.Equally knowing a word does not necessarily assure its contextual usage. It is impossible to memorise all the words in a language by rotelearning. But there is another way. Many scholars of memory have studiedthe act of knowledge acquisition pre-writing. Long before the advent of papyrusand written alphabet, humanity has been communicating through oral tradition. Longbefore the internet, mobile phones and global positioning systems peopletravelled, told tales and passed information in a narrative format.The oral story teller was skilled at his or her craft. Theymay embellish a few details. They may exaggerate, spice up the tale, introducea bit of magic and mythology- anything to sell a story and make it memorable. Sometimesthese exaggerated myths remain and the original tale or idea may be lost.However, there is no denying the power of a story to make a piece of knowledge memorable. Georg Bergman : Der Erzahler ( The Story Teller)Bruno GiordanoThe Shadow of IdeasIn my quest to bring stories to words, you may encountermany truths and many myths. It may help you to expand and interconnect the wordroots to discover meanings to other words or discover new words themselves.This is the kind of learning that excites me, the sheer jumping off from one tothe other, marvelling at new ideas, new worlds and new images.One of the scholars who studied the art of mnemonics and themagic of memory is Giordano Bruno, a 16th century Dominican Monkwhose treatises in the art of memory have enjoyed a renaissance in recentyears. He was one of the first to link memory to images and advised on how to rememberpassages and words using spatial anchoring. His book De Umbris Idearum ( the Shadowof Ideas) expounds many new ideas on learning. And one of his ideas is to have a person, a place, a thing,an event to link up to a new word or an idea. So in our journey through thealphabet we come to C. There are several C words to choose from ( careful!)but I am going with the ones that offer fascinating stories and fascinating roots.We first visit The Aztecs whose Nahuatl language yielded the word that willmelt in our mouth, make our brain squirm in ecstasy and has given a lot ofpleasure since its invention.I do indeed, refer to the marvellous Chocolate.

We are asking the...CHOCOLATEThis Aztecs believed Xocolatl was brought down from theheavens by the feathered serpent  God Quetzalcoatlin the form of the sacred cacoa tree. The ancient mayans roasted, ground and madea paste of the cacoa beans. This produced a very bitter dark drink that they believedto have aphrodisiac properties. They drank this in copious quantities. To put alittle kick to it, they flavoured it with chilli and cornmeal, fermented it anddrank it for its health benefits. It was favoured by Aztec royalty and it is believedMontezuma drank several cups a day before proceeding to do his harem duties!Infact, when Cortez pillaged and ransacked the royal palaces, it wasnt silver or gold that was found in the royal palaces in copious quantities, it was piles ofcacao beans, Montezumas own personal stash of brown-viagra!The word Xococ means bitter and atl means water or adrink. It remained for many hundreds of years a bitter sugar free drink. It wasleft to the Europeans to sweeten this bitter drink and introduce it to Frenchand Spanish royalty as a hot drink. For centuries this remained in the drinkform.The chocolate in its current hardened form didnt arriveuntil the 18th century when the Industrial revolution brought millsthat could squeeze out the cocoa butter and create the hard durable chocolatewe all love and adore. The rest as they say is history.I recently had a chilli flavoured chocolate mousse for dessert. Ahh.. the bitter sweetness fo the chocolate was enhanced by the capsaicin of the chilli peppers. My tastebuds all stood up and sang a celestial chorus! Whether it had Montezuma like effect on me would be telling.hush!Ferrero Rocher Hazelnut Chocolates 48 count gift boxAmazon Price: $14.75List Price: $13.10Chocolate Belgian Truffles Donckels - 1 Pound BoxAmazon Price: $5.99Anthon Berg Chocolate Liqueurs with Original Spirits - 64 pcs.

This wasnt to be. The Portuguese, when they first cameacross coconut palms in India, thought the three dark spots on the shell and thehairy outer skin resembled el coco  - a bogeyman.  In Spanish speaking countries parents singlullabies to their children and tell them to sleep or else el coco will cometo get them. Vasco Da Gama, after his voyages to India, brought with him the coconutto Europe and the portugese name coco stuck. For years prior to that it was simply known as  Nux Indica or the 'India nut' which was Marco Polo's original name for it..So coconut has no roots in cocoa but a hairy, scary bogeyman!I must admit the one in the photo looks rather cute.

CallisthenicsCallipygian VenusMy rival in Gluteii : Michelangelo's DavidKaleidoscopeCALLIGRAPHYWho doesnt appreciate the beauty that is Calligraphy. Withthe advent of computers, mobile phone and other electronic devices of communication and keyboards, the art of writing and penmanship issadly becoming lost. Gone are the wonderful pleasures of writing a letter withpen and ink. Although there is a quite a lot of niche interest in Calligraphyone hopes it is not a fading art form.The Greeks had a word for beauty Kallos ( presumablylinked to the Sanskrit word Kalyan meaning the same). This root has producedmany words in English, Calligraphy meaning one of them. As you would haveguessed by now, Calligraphy literally means Calli  beautiful and graphywriting. The latter suffix graph or graphy also crops up in Biography (writing about ones life).However, sticking with Calli or Kalli you may findCallisthenics, a branch of exercise that gives you beautiful muscles ( Calli +sthenos).I never my thought journey from Calligraphy with the root Kalloswill give me a new word that I never knew existed but will give me a much moreerudite way to describe someone's sexy Gluteii.Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Callipygian which simplymeans beautiful/shapely buttocks. There is a Callipygian Venus statue whereshe lifts her robe to admire the shapely derriere.For those who favour the male derriere, sadly modestyprevents me from showing my own off but instead I give you the picture of mynearest rival, Michelangelos David.Dont you agree that Callipygian sounds much morecivilised than booty?Or does it?You will find the same root in Kaleidoscope ( Kal- beautiful, eidos- shape, scope- viewer)Poems for LoversPoem: When I touch you# When I touch you...

In fact, in legal circles the term in camera is still used for closeddiscussions held in the Judges chamber.When the original optical device which was the precursor ofmodern camera was invented, it was called Camera Obscura or a Hidden chamber.The name then stuck through its subsequent incarnations.Many believe that some Renaissance artists used a CameraObscura to trace their subjects image and then colour it.

In the same vein, catastrophe means down- turn the root kat  indicating down perhaps meaning a dramatic down turn  of events. This is the same root as in cataclysm.kat  yields arich vein to mine. It is the same root that gives us the catapult. In itsoriginal form the catapult was an ancient instrument of war used to hurl dartsor arrows. It then was used to throw stones and boulders. The current hand heldY shaped version didnt arrive till the 19th century. Catapult comesfrom kat and pllein to hurl.Cataract, meaning waterfall, comes from the Greek word katraktes meaning rushing down whichdoesnt take much explaining.Before we get carried away with this logic, I must hastilyinclude catamaran, which has nothing to do with Greeks.Docmo's Other HubsChanging for Good : New Year, New You!New Year, New You!

The Indian peninsula offers thousands of miles of coastlinefor fishing.

Printing platesPrinting PressCLICHEAnd finally, a word every self respecting writer shuddersat. Clich.Clichmeans the loss of artistic merit from a word or a phrase due to overuse.No one wants to be a clich or want to talk or write a clich.Yet all around us we see clichs alive and well.The word clich comes from French clicher.

I am constantly amazed at the genius of language, astounded at quotes I read from centuries ago that so artistically, cleverly, and beautifully express an idea. My quest to create wordplay, interest and an uncommon expression of a well known emotion is my motivation for my recent, modest attempt at poetry. This piece is at the heart of writing as words are the paint, the brushes and canvas that create either just another read or a masterpiece.  You are an artist, Docmo.  Your writing always inspires me.Docmo8 days ago Amy, you wield your chosen words with the grace of an artist. Your palette is the rainbow, your poems are your paintings.
