Donald L. Carcieri, had issued to crack down on illegal immigration.To cheers, Governor Chafee officially rescinded the edict that he termed an agent of divisiveness, incivility and distrust among the states citizens. He did so in a packed room at the International Institute of Rhode Island, a nonprofit agency that assists immigrants and refugees.Chafee said he was turning back the clock to March 26, 2008, the day before Carcieri issued his Illegal Immigration Control Order. Carcieri said then that he intended to curb what he termed an epidemic, the costly flow of illegal immigrants. The order sparked numerous protests and spread fear in the immigrant community.Today, we are living up to those standards established by Roger Williams when he came here in 1636, Chafee said, standards of welcome, tolerance, personal rights and the broadest freedoms in the world.The rescission lifts a requirement that state agencies and state vendors screen employees through the federal E-Verify system. Critics say E-Verify is prone to inaccuracy.Chafee also clarified that he is also directing state police Col. Brendan P. Doherty to end the so-called 287(g) agreement between state police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Carcieris order directed state police to pursue the agreement. It led to four troopers being deputized with immigration-enforcement powers.Chafee cleared up confusion left after one of his senior staff members said Tuesday night that the rescission would leave the 287(g) agreement in place, and that whether the governor would choose to terminate the agreement is a different question. Thats not whats on the table  for right now. That is an issue that will be addressed in due course.Asked if the memorandum of understanding with ICE will be revoked, Chafee replied, Thats correct. Thats correct. He added, We will continue to work with all the immigrant communities and state police to make sure were enforcing the laws to the best of our ability, but not doing immigration and customs work.Doherty said later, I thought the [287(g)] process was working well. Reasonable minds may differ, but he is the governor.He added, We will continue to communicate and cooperate with ICE on matters of mutual concern and make sure the people of Rhode Island are safe in a variety of ways.Chafee said the real answer to curbing illegal immigration is through federal immigration reform. He pledged to push for that through the National Governors Association to get our immigrant community  some of whom are living in the shadows  out of the shadows.Chafees repeal, accomplished through an executive order terminating [the] illegal immigration control order, drew immediate praise.But some attending the ceremony raised concerns that new Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartins stated intent to enter a federal Secure Communities initiative could overshadow Chafees repeal of the executive order.The initiative would allow law-enforcement officers to fingerprint people under arrest and have them automatically checked against an immigration databasehttp://www.projo.com/news/content/CHAFEE_RESCINDS_ORDER_01-06-11_8GLQJOO_v15.34cdb6.htmlWritten by Timothy Peter Leal about 1 day ago.Giffords HUBBY is an astronautsupposed to go into orbit in AprilWritten by Timothy Peter Leal about 1 day ago.I think Safeway might have been one of the places I visited in an  effort to find Apple Boxes a sage recommendation in quality moving boxesWritten by Democratic Socialist Dave about 1 day ago.The Tucson media dont seem to have much more (in fact a bit less) than Fox News and NPR, unless the latter are reporting unconfirmed sources as established fact.http://www.kgun9.com/Global/story.asp?S=13807756http://www.kvoa.com/http://www.kold.com/Global/story.asp?S=13807677Rep.

Jerry Brown to fill.Moreno, 62, a former federal judge who joined the court in October 2001, is stepping down Feb. 28, less than four months after winning voter approval for a new 12-year term. He said the reasons for his decision include family concerns, finances and Browns election.The Democratic governors victory gives me a certain comfort level about who his replacement will be, Moreno said.A weekly commuter from Los Angeles who is not among the San Francisco-based courts wealthier members, Moreno said he could better provide for his family  which includes a daughter with autism and a son who wants to go to law school  by working as a lawyer or a private arbitrator.Supreme Court justices make $218,237 a year.Top justice surprisedHis announcement clearly surprised the courts new chief justice, Tani Cantil-Sakauye, who said she had expected to serve alongside Moreno for at least a decade.
