About 2,000 black birds fell from the sky off Windwood Drive, leaving quite the mess to clean up.Folks Todays THV spoke with initially thought the birds were poisoned because they are what they call a nuisance around this time every year, but they are surprised to hear it is more of a mystery.Stephen Bryant recalls, Millions, millions fly over every night. You look up at the sky and its just black and then last night at about 10:30 I came out here and saw a bird drop.In a matter of hours on New Years Eve thousands of birds fell from the sky to their death.Melissa Weatherly says, I immediately called mom because I had to go to work, I said you have to come get the kids and get the dog because I dont know whats going on. She continues, It was horrible; you could not even get down the road without running over hundreds. It was that bad.The mystery is unraveling like scenes from a movie, dozens of U.S. Environmental Services crews spent the day picking up the birds, walking between homes and climbing on people roofs with protective hazmat suits and breathing masks.Charles Boldrey stands outside watching the crews, Nobody knows, I asked these guys who are out here picking them up and they dont seem to know anything, nobody seems to know anything. It just kind of freaked everybody out.Officials with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission flew over the area and determined its a one mile stretch. There are a variety of dead black birds, mostly red winged and a duck was also found.No one has been evacuated because the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) air test came back clean for toxins.Weatherly is skeptical, Theyre walking around in mask and Im wondering do we need the same thing because what makes that happen for them to drop out of the sky like that.Katherina Yancy with Todays THV found one bird still living. It was confused, injured, continuously walked in circles and didnt make a sound or attempt to fly.Officials will confirm their findings when they get the test results, until then they are giving these possible scenarios: lightning, stress, high altitude hail or startled by fireworks, but neighbors just want answers.Bryant says, Something out of a movie and Hazmat people are walking around not telling us anything.Boldrey adds, Id like to know. Kind of spooky, you never know whats going to happen.The birds should be cleaned up by Sunday. Game and Fish Commissions Karen Rowe says poisoning doesnt appear to be the case and strange events similar to this have occurred across the globe a number of times.The City of Beebe held an emergency city council meeting Saturday morning to approve paying the U.S. Environmental Services to clean the neighborhood.Sixty-five dead birds have been sent to off for testing.Arkansas Game and Fish Press Release:BEEBE, Ark. Friday night, ringing in the New Year took on a whole different meaning for the citizens of Beebe. Around 11:30 p.m., enforcement officers with Arkansas Game and Fish Commission began getting reports of dead black birds falling from the sky in the city limits of Beebe.Officers estimated that over 1,000 birds had fallen out of the sky over the city before midnight. Most of the birds were dead, but some were still alive when officers arrived. The blackbirds fell over a one-mile area in the city. AGFC wildlife officer Robby King responded to the reports and found hundreds of birds. Shortly after I arrived there were still birds falling from the sky, King said. King collected about 65 dead birds that will be sent to the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission lab and the National Wildlife Health Center lab in Madison, Wis.The AGFC has flown over the area to gauge the scope of the event. There were no other birds found outside of the initial area.AGFC ornithologist Karen Rowe said that strange events similar to this one have occurred a number of times across the globe. Test results usually were inconclusive, but the birds showed physical trauma and that the flock could have been hit by lightning or high-altitude hail, Rowe said.Another scenario may have been that New Years Eve revelers shooting off fireworks in the area may have startled the birds from their roost. The birds may have died from stress.Rowe said that it didnt appear as though the birds died of any poisoning or other event. Since it only involved a flock of blackbirds and only involved them falling out of the sky it is unlikely they were poisoned, but a necropsy is the only way to determine if the birds died from trauma or toxin, she said. Testing will begin on Monday.The City of Beebe has hired U.S. Environmental Services to begin the cleanup and dispose of the dead birds. The environmental firm will go door-to-door to pick up the birds that are still in yards and on roof tops.THVs Katherina Yancy is in Beebe and will have more on this story tonight on Todays THV at 6:00 and also on the THV 10:00 Difference.For The Full Story:groups:News tags:USDA,google trends,us department of agriculture,Bird kill |128 comments// Massive populations of red wing black birds fall from the sky dead in Arkansas, New Jersey & New York > Thanks to the work of the USDA // Videohide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

The people who are at the front lines of putting out these asinine statements clearly think that the public is completely without intelligence and willing to swallow any absurd "explanation" if it's repeated incessantly for a time and attached to the lips of some so-called "experts". Hmmmm...could they be right about that?I've been saying, since I heard the first thing about the redwinged blackbirds and fish in Arkansas, that there are now toxic clouds not too far up that are gathering from all the burning and evaporation they encouraged to happen in the spill and getting more dense. I figured that just like their chemicals cause congealing of the oil in the water its also combined in the air for a gaseous congealing of sorts so now theres the same kinds of toxic clouds in the air that there were/are in the water. Then when it rains through those gas clouds it precipitates out and poisons the inland fresh water and some species are more immediately killed off than others. I've heard also that this is not just happening in the U.S.Of course this will be denied and possibly several such mindbendingly stupid explanations as "blunt trauma" and fireworks displays will be spat out by various "experts" until the corrupt, junk science establishment can come to a consensus about what idiotic party line they feel comfortable getting behind as their official pronouncement in an effort to provide culpable deniability for their corporate masters.  16:3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.16:4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.16:5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.16:6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.16:7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.(King James Bible, Revelation) 2 days agoflag  reply0Wetdog------" Today it emerged that about 500 red-winged blackbirds and starlings had been found dead in Louisiana.

Just so the sidewalks and parks can look nice.        So,  we plant these huge lawns and parks(which is what geese eat)----then, we kill the geese that come to eat on them.      Then we have to put chemicals and fertilizers on them to get the grass to grow----and the chemicals and fertilizer run off the lawns and parks and into our drinking water.

And then today you still see the same officials still wearing their Hazmat suits and mask only now their carrying M16's and the government has set up shop down the street. DAMN IT....Someone has some explaining to do and the frickin public wants answers.  OK then all of sudden here's all the fish dying.  Ok well now stop and think about that, "if" the USDA poisoned the birds, wouldn't it make sense if they -the birds fly over water and defecate...perhaps their waste falls into the water and made the fish die?     About 10yrs ago a documentary re: electromagnetic waves/disturbances that were found in abundance in Great Britain,  perhaps may be something to do with the earths Ley lines quite possibly...Could this be something of the same here? Yes Maybe.A similar incident took place with Starlings about a year ago and again we saw this as droves of dead birds dropped from the sky in Staten Island December 22nd 2007.  If you DO YOUR research this is not uncommon but interesting.  Could the great and wonderful "Trust worthy" government know more than what they're telling..Yeah I'm sure. I've got it !....It's a UFO invasion and they hate some of earths birds. Could it be the government testing  sound waves and mind control possible, BTW: Did you know you can put a large magnet on the head of an alligator when you move him from one location to another and it prevents him from having memory of the move so he can't find his way back home?

La plupart des oiseaux taient des carouges  paulettes, reconnaissables  leurs taches rouges  la base des ailes."Nous sommes maintenant presque srs que cest un traumatisme qui a caus leur mort", a dclar un responsable des services vtrinaires de lEtat, George Badley.Un habitant a indiqu avoir entendu une vingtaine de dtonations samedi soir, --peut-tre des feux dartifice ou des coups de canons utiliss pour se dbarrasser des oiseaux nuisibles--, suivies par le vol erratique dune grande quantit doiseaux."Il a entendu les carouges voltiger dans tous les sens, il a entendu leurs battements dailes et les a entendu heurter des obstacles", a racont M.

I agree with you on that.     That would not help anything or anyone.       I will say this however about the video that Gerard posted.     It does contain a reference to a poisoning incident on the east coast in which the USDA admitted to poisoning some 2 million starlings.     That is a LOT of birds-----the carcasses of which would fill a fleet of very large trucks.       It would require a very large amount of poison.       So what happens?      This large amount of poison is put out------>the birds feed on it------->and fly off to who knows where-------->then they die------->then we have poison spread all over the place.        Then they announce that the poison is harmless to humans.     Well, I'm a little skeptical of THAT----what would you expect them to say about something that killed millions of birds that they spread all over and didn't tell anyone about?      CYA.       What about dogs or cats that might eat the dead birds?      Or other animals?      What if it gets into the water supply?      How long does it stay in the environment?     Just because it does not list toxic effects on the label does not mean there are no toxic effects--------it just means that the chemical manufacturer might be very good at hiding the toxic effects, or maybe they are not known yet.      Marketing and using toxic chemicals and using less than ethical means to hide or dismiss toxic effects has a long and successful history where enough $$$ are involved.           I'm not making any claims or accusations here----and it could have been anyone, it isn't just the government that puts out poisons.     That's the trouble with poisons----once you put them out there, there is no telling where they might end up.      I think this story needs to be watched and needs to be followed up on closely.       All I can say is that red wings are beautiful birds---always one of my favorites.     I've never known or even heard of red wings being the least bit bothersome or pests. 6 days agoflag  reply0Johnny_Los_AngelesPersonally I would rather it was biological then there would be nothing to worry about.

Thousands of Fish in the rivers and birds in the sky, both suddenly dying n the same small space has to be more than just a coincidence. Sound is not killing the fish.Your question is answered and I'm going to bed now. Good night. 6 days agoflag  reply0Vierotchka  keithponder:Only one species of fish died in that fish kill - the drum, which gathers by the tens of thousands in deep waters in winter. Had it been poison of any kind, all the other local fish species would also have died, so biologists think it must have been a disease that only affects the drum, and the fact that they gather in vast numbers in deep waters in the winter resulted in the disease spreading very rapidly among them due to the crowded conditions. Also, the fish kill occurred some 125 miles from Beebe, so the two phenomena are unrelated, and I never suggested that sound was the cause of the fish kill. So please do answer my question instead of throwing a tantrum. 6 days agoflag  reply0Vierotchka  keithponder:"Adding to the mystery is an apparent fish kill 125 miles away in the same state. A day before the bird die-off, a tugboat operator near Ozark, Ark., spotted thousands of dead drum fish floating in the Arkansas River. Biologists say the two events are probably not related and suggest that the fish kill  a much more common event than a bird rain  is likely linked to a disease that affected only one species."http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2011/0103/Search-for-clues-is-on-after-bird... 6 days agoflag  reply0keithponder  Vierotchka:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40885546/ns/us_news-environment/?gt1=43001First Tests Suggest Midair Collision, But Why Still Isn't Certain; Number Raised To At Least 4,000.====================================================================Your experts suggesting midair collisions is an absolute joke.

Beyond that all the birds were healthy. The state is also performing chemical and disease testing, but the results will take a week.Neighbors reported "five to 12 booming noises in the eastern part of town. They reported it sounding like a cannon or transformer exploding," but officials are still investigating to find out what the noises were, Rowe says.The blackbird flock then rose from its roost and tried to fly away, but possibly because of fireworks in the sky "they naturally wouldn't want to go up high," Rowe says."They were below the roof line, so they were hitting houses, mail boxes, chimneys and walls," says Rowe. Blackbirds have very poor night vision.The first calls about the incident came in at about 11:00 p.m. on New Year's Eve, says Keith Stephens, with the Game and Fish Commission."They told us there were birds falling out of the sky. After we verified that this wasn't some kind of prank, one of our wildlife officers went over there and sure enough, there were birds falling," he says.Large flocks of blackbirds are very common in Arkansas, Stephens says. "It's not uncommon to see hundreds or thousands of them in a field feeding. Once they're startled they can almost completely blacken the sky."The wildlife agent sent to Beebe wasn't able to tell how many blackbirds took wing. "It was pitch black and they are black," Stephens points out. But "they were just raining down."The state Department of Emergency Management did testing of the air and found nothing amiss, so the state isn't putting out any health warnings, Stephens says.The number of dead blackbirds is more than 3,000, says Rowe. They were mostly found in the Windwood neighborhood of the town of 4,500. "Environmental Services says they picked up approximately 2,000 birds," she says. There were others they couldn't reach, and "scavengers probably carried off quite a bit  if you're a cat, it's Christmas dinner."Over the past several weeks "there have been swarms of blackbirds flying over" the neighborhood, says Ginger Pearson, owner of Beebe Tees & Things, a clothing store. "There's a wooded area back behind it."The subdivision was previously agricultural fields and a nearby forested area has long been home to the blackbird flock, says Rowe. The birds have been enough of a nuisance that in previous years the town has asked the state Dept. of Agriculture to disperse them.Redwing Blackbirds are native to North America and gather in large flocks in the winter, generally settling near food sources for weeks at a time, says Mike Parr of the American Bird Conservancy in Washington D.C.The number of birds that died is high, he says, but "to put the number in perspective, windows, communication towers, power lines and wind turbines kill tens of millions of birds each year, probably hundreds of millions."In an unrelated event, a major fish kill was reported on the Arkansas river, also on New Year's Day, says Stephens. About 80,000 to 100,000 dead freshwater drum were found along a 20-mile stretch of the river.State officials believe the fish kill was disease-related, as it only affected one species, and it was during a cold spell when the fish would have concentrated in deep water, allowing "the disease to spread fairly quickly," says Stephens. Specimens have been sent to state labs for testing.While this is an extremely large fish kill, they're not that uncommon, and can be caused by disease, changes in water temperature or low oxygen levels.There's no reason to think the blackbirds and the freshwater drum deaths are related.

The color red indicates the animals flying into the storm.Raining animalsRaining animals is a rare meteorological phenomenon, although occurrences have been reported from many countries throughout history. One hypothesis that has been offered to explain this phenomenon is that strong winds travelling over water sometimes pick up creatures such as fish or frogs, and carry them for up to several miles.[1] However, this primary aspect of the phenomenon has never been witnessed or scientifically tested.The animals most likely to drop from the sky in a rainfall are fish, frogs and birds, in that order. Sometimes the animals survive the fall, especially fish, suggesting the animals are dropped shortly after extraction. Several witnesses of raining frogs describe the animals as startled, though healthy, and exhibiting relatively normal behavior shortly after the event. In some incidents, however, the animals are frozen to death or even completely encased in ice. There are examples where the product of the rain is not intact animals, but shredded body parts. Some cases occur just after storms having strong winds, especially during tornadoes.However, there have been many unconfirmed cases in which rainfalls of animals have occurred in fair weather and in the absence of strong winds or waterspouts.The English language idiom "it is raining cats and dogs", referring to a heavy downpour, is of uncertain etymology, and there is no evidence that it has any connection to the "raining animals" phenomenon.ExplanationsFrench physicist Andr-Marie Ampre was among the first scientists to take seriously accounts of raining animals. He tried to explain rains of frogs with a hypothesis that was eventually refined by other scientists. Speaking in front of the Society of Natural Sciences, Ampre suggested that at times frogs and toads roam the countryside in large numbers, and that the action of violent winds can pick them up and carry them great distances.[2]More recently, a scientific explanation for the phenomenon has been developed that involves tornadic waterspouts [3]. Waterspouts are capable of capturing objects and animals and lifting them into the air. Under this theory, waterspouts or tornados transport animals to relatively high altitudes, carrying them over large distances. The winds are capable of carrying the animals over a relatively wide area and allow them to fall in a concentrated fashion in a localized area.[4] More specifically, some tornadoes can completely suck up a pond, letting the water and animals fall some distance away in the form of a rain of animals.[5]This hypothesis appears supported by the type of animals in these rains: small and light, usually aquatic.[6] It is also supported by the fact that the rain of animals is often preceded by a storm. However the theory does not account for how all the animals involved in each individual incident would be from only one species, and not a group of similarly-sized animals from a single area.In the case of birds, storms may overcome a flock in flight, especially in times of migration. The image to the right shows an example where a group of bats is overtaken by a thunderstorm.[7]. The image shows how the phenomenon could take place in some cases. In the image, the bats are in the red zone, which corresponds to winds moving away from the radar station, and enter into a mesocyclone associated with a tornado (in green). These events may occur easily with birds in flight. In contrast, it is harder to find a plausible explanation for rains of terrestrial animals; the enigma persists despite scientific studies.Sometimes, scientists have been incredulous of extraordinary claims of rains of fish. For example, in the case of a rain of fish in Singapore in 1861, French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau explained that the supposed rain took place during a migration of walking catfish, which are capable of dragging themselves over the land from one puddle to another.[8] Thus, he argued that the appearance of fish on the ground immediately after a rain was easily explained, as these animals usually move over soft ground or after a rain.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raining_animals 6 days agoflag  reply-1gerardange  Vierotchka:AGAIN....The USDA has already admitted the act of feeding the birds poison and to the of killing two million birds. 6 days agoflag  reply+1Vierotchka  gerardange:Source?

(AP)  Wildlife experts are trying to solve a mystery that evoked images of the apocalypse: Why did more than 3,000 red-winged blackbirds tumble from the Arkansas sky shortly before midnight on New Year's Eve?Scientists are investigating whether fireworks, poison or bad weather might have forced the birds out of the sky, or if a disoriented bird simply led the flock into the ground."We have a lot more questions," said Karen Rowe, an ornithologist with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. She said there are documented cases of birds becoming confused and plunging to earth.Residents of the small town of Beebe, northeast of Little Rock, awoke Saturday to find thousands of dead blackbirds littering a 1.5-square-mile area. The birds inexplicably dropped dead, landing on homes, cars and lawns.Cleanup crews wore white suits, gas masks and rubber gloves as they spent the holiday weekend gathering the carcasses.The birds will not be missed. Large blackbird roosts like one at Beebe can have thousands of birds that leave ankle- to knee-deep piles of droppings in places.Nearly a decade ago, state wildlife officials fired blanks from shotguns and cannons to move a roost of thousands of blackbirds from Beebe, but in recent years many of the migratory birds returned.Bird carcasses were shipped to the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission and the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis. Researchers in Georgia also asked for a set of the dead birds. Test results could be back in a week.Rowe said many of the birds suffered injuries from striking the ground, but it was not clear whether they were alive when they hit.Blackbirds have notoriously bad eyesight. If startled at night, they could easily fly into the ground, Rowe said. A few grackles and a couple of starlings were also among the dead. Those species roost with blackbirds, particularly in winter.Violent weather rumbled over much of the state Friday, including a tornado that killed three people in Cincinnati, Ark. Lightning could have killed the birds directly or startled them to the point that they became confused. Hail also has been known to knock birds from the sky.In 2001, lightning killed about 20 mallards at Hot Springs, and a flock of dead pelicans was found in the woods about 10 years ago, Rowe said. Lab tests showed that they, too, had been hit by lighting.Back in 1973, hail knocked birds from the sky at Stuttgart, Ark., on the day before hunting season. Some of the birds were caught in a violent storm's updrafts and became encased in ice before falling from the sky.Rowe said poisoning was possible but unlikely. She said birds of prey and other animals, including dogs and cats, ate several of the dead birds and suffered no ill effects."Every dog and cat in the neighborhood that night was able to get a fresh snack that night," Rowe said.Copyright  2011 The Associated Press.

Puwahahaha 6 days agoflag  reply+1Vierotchkahttp://abcnews.go.com/US/killed-thousands-black-birds-hundreds-thousands-drum-fi...Thunder and lightning is being blamed for the death of thousands of blackbirds who rained down out of the Arkansas sky on New Year's Eve. "There were multiple thunderstorms that night and for several days that week," said Dr. George Badley, state veterinarian for the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission. "Red-winged blackbirds fly in large groups and if they got pulled into a thunderstorm, likely lightning struck them. That would be my best guess."Officials sent some of the carcasses of the red-winged blackbirds to Badley's Arkansas laboratory. The rest of the birds to be tested were taken to laboratories in Georgia and Wisconsin."Almost every one of them...had multiple internal hemorrhages which would mean that it was trauma, not a disease process. Their stomachs were empty, which would rule out toxicity from eating some kind of poison grain," Badley said.Blood and culture tests on the birds are still pending.With just minutes to go before New Year's Day, dead birds began falling over Beebe, Ark., a town of 5,000 people located 40 miles northeast of Little Rock.Officials from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said that at least 2,000 carcasses of the birds were collected by the U.S. Environmental Services on Saturday and Sunday, but they believe that up to 3,500 birds actually tumbled from the sky.The black birds roost in huge numbers across eastern Arkansas."They're almost like clouds at times the way they fly across the landscape," Jeff Williams from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said.Williams said birds are more susceptible to trauma than many people realize."Birds are pretty fragile. They can be stressed out very easily," Williams said.Williams said that fireworks set off by those celebrating the New Year or thunderstorms could have startled the birds. While State Veterinarian Badley didn't rule out the possibility of fireworks, he thought that it was highly unlikely to be the cause.It's not the first time birds have dropped from the Arkansas sky. Lightning killed ducks at Hot Springs in 2001 and hail knocked birds from the sky at Stuttgart in 1973 on the day before hunting season. 6 days agoflag  reply0gerardange  Vierotchka:The USDA has admitted the act of feeding the birds poison and to killing 2 million Birds. 6 days agoflag  reply+1Vierotchka  gerardange:Source?

Red wings are pretty common, and you'll see them pretty much grouped around any body of water, especially low marshy land.      But, they are solitary nesters---they do not flock together in large groups as for instance ducks.    It just seems strange to me.     Birds that do not flock but live in a riparian environment(water's edge) killed in large numbers----one solitary duck(which do flock) found.      A large fish kill at the same time.          Something is sure not right here----and the explanations in the articles seem pretty implausible to me---birds are fragile????    Uuuuummmm, not in my experience they aren't.         There's something strange in the neighborhood---I think we need to call Ghostbusters.      I don't have any explanation---except that I think the ones given in the article are pretty much off wall. 6 days agoflag  reply0Vierotchka  Wetdog:The old saying, Birds of a feather flock together, is particularly true among blackbirds in winter. Though many birds band together during winter, none are as notorious for their flocking behavior as blackbirdsred-winged blackbirds, European starlings, common grackles and brown-headed cowbirds.This group of a feather often flock together in the many thousands, sometimes the millions. One winter roost in the Great Dismal Swamp on the Virginia-North Carolina border held an estimated 15 million birds. Flocks in the thousands often roost in urban and suburban areas, where their numbers and their noise make them unpopular among the people living nearby. Attempts by state and federal wildlife officials to discourage or destroy such flocks of wintering blackbirds have usually failed. One experiment, using a wetting agent sprayed on a huge flock of birds from an aircraft, left a much greater mess in the form of rotting carcasses.Many wonder why birds in general and blackbirds in particular gather in flocks in winter. Though studies have been inconclusive, it is believed that there is safety in numbers. With many more eyes and ears to search for food and watch for predators, the chance of an individual bird surviving winter is increased. There are reports of hawks attacking flocks of flying birds time and again, but failing to capture even one when the prey closed ranks to form a mass that the hawk was unwilling or unable to penetrate without being injured.http://californiabirdwatching.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/flock-together-red-winged... 6 days agoflag  reply0gerardange  Vierotchka:Vierotchka:Maybe.... you should try viewing the original video at the top of the page @ 2:44 for the USDA Confirmation on the poisoning of the birds.vierotchka, everything you say is "plausible"...

It seems very coincidental that birds which depend on water for habitat begin falling dead from the sky, and a massive fish kill happen in the same state(although presumably over 100 miles apart) at the same time.

No. 6 days agoflag  reply0Vierotchka  gerardange:As for watching the video again, no thanks - it is of such poor visual quality that it hurts the eyes, and as an artist I need to preserve my eyes. 6 days agoflag  reply+1Wetdog  gerardange:absolutely excellent  comment Gerard! 6 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  gerardange:What does this have to do with this story? Did I miss something? 6 days agoflag  reply+2gerardange  Vierotchka:Yes, the video quality was quite bad and using that for a story was embarrassing, Glad that I had no hand in that.       Regardless, I forced myself again to watch it again for the 4th & 5th time.  And if you didn't figure it out already... There are actually "three"separate news stories of reports from three different states; Arkansas, New Jersey & New York=  All with dead birds !       I did locate that one spot where one guy who was being interviewed was saying "millions and millions of birds" at the [ 11 minute mark on the tape].  But, was not in proper context.      When I did a google search early this morning I found another video that also referred to "millions of dead birds".  But upon reviewing that video, it turned out that it was the same news footage with the guy from the first interview.     So, armed with that clearer knowledge, I re-adjusted the title I struck the Millions and added New Jersey & New York.I'm thinking now....   Am, I getting paid for this?   This sucked most of my day dealing with all this nonsense. I think I need to concentrate more of my time on my real work than on stuff like this.All the best,Gerard 6 days agoflag  reply0ImConcerned  gerardange:i'd wear a hazmat suit before test results came back too.... thats kind of common sense, dont you think? 6 days agoflag  reply0ImConcerned  gerardange:you may not have aids or tuburculosis, but your dentist is still going to use gloves and a mask.... is he being paranoid? or cautious? 6 days agoflag  reply0ImConcerned  gerardange:i agree... you shouldnt post the first story you see... people on here are smart, and they will correct you if your information is wrong 6 days agoflag  reply0Blud  Vierotchka:cyber warrior 5 days agoflag  reply-1Mercy_Perez  Vierotchka:Vierotchka I have read some of your post and links and clearly you don't believe that the Government has nothing to do with it.  The Government has many secrets involved and yes I strongly believe that they have something to do.  Have you read the book from William Cooper called Behold a Pale White Horse?  If not, you should start reading it.  Also, have you seen what the Government is involved in and yet we don't know anything about it.  Take a look at this video and then u tell me if Governments don't have secrets ....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZOt29NR0FYhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOWWIDT910I 3 days agoflag  replymore fromNews:Suspected CIA Banker Allen Stanfords Trial Indefinitely Delayed Online USA News: Fernanda Vasconcellos with her shoes Michael Vick More Important to Obama Than Family of Soldier Killed In Combat The #1 Work From Home Business Of 2011 . . . most populartop rankednew & rising1Remember When Beck Ridiculed Pelosi For Speaking Out Agains... 2Obama lays blow to closing Guantanamo 3Obama Created More Jobs in One Year Than Bush Created in Eight 4Corporations or politicians hurting America? 5Congress to Reduce Free Speech? -- In Response to shooting 6The system suited everybody until the crisis hit  Ron Paul 7LIFE'S GOOD, SHUT UP ! 8A Real Hero....
