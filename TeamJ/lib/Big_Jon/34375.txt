Its not that Im a bad player, its just that in some case, I simply cannot get past some parts of a game.Like most PC game players Ive scoured the web for cheats, and while I have found them, Ive been frustrated with the pop-ups that constantly hamper my progress to find the cheats, or the twenty eight pages I have to click through to get to the actual codes.So I decided to formulate my own cheat pages. The games listed below are some of the games Ive resorted to using cheat codes; currently I point to traditional cheat sites, but overtime I will create my own dedicated cheat site. The games where I have my own dedicated site are:Divinity 2 CheatsDragon Age CheatsBorderlands CheatsFallout 3 Cheats.Assassin's Creed 2 CheatsAvatar: The Game Cheats.Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion CheatsCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Hints and TipsOver the next six weeks I will publish new sites and over time I hope to have a decent and easy to use cheat site  please let me know your thoughts in the comments section below; I always welcome ideas on how to improve my web pages.Assassin's Creed II: The Complete Official GuideAmazon Price: $9.87List Price: $19.99Assassins Creed II CheatsAssassins Crede Hints tips and cheats.Assassin's Creed 2Assassin's Creed 2 is the follow up to the original Assassin's Creed game. Much like the first game, gameplay relies on use of stealth and assassin skills rather than brute force to complete missions.The game features stunning graphics, and is one of the most playable games of the Genre, fully immersing you into the atmosphere and story. This game is a must for all fans of #D first person games.Age of Empires III: Complete CollectionAmazon Price: $24.59List Price: $49.95Age of Empires III CheatsAge of Empires III codes, cheat codes, FAQs, walk-throughs, hints and more.Age of Empires 3Age of Empires 3 is a real-time strategy game by Microsoft. Essentially it's a fairly atypical colonization / battle game that is based on the colonization of America between 1492 and 1850.Like most of these games it requires a keen mind to be able to control each element of the game, from strategy to people management to economics. You can take control of each aspect of the game, although there is a lot of help if required. It is one of the better RTS games available.AvatarAmazon Price: $18.99List Price: $19.99Avatar the game: review, hints and tips.Ubisoft usually produce decent games, but for once havent managed to bring the magic to this game. With a superb movie playing in the theaters, Ubisoft had the chance to make Avatar and exciting and...Avatar: The GameWhile it's nice to see a tie-in to such a good movie, Avatar: The Game fails to impress. The graphics are very good and the sound (aside from the voice acting) is also good. However, the game really is mediocre.It's a typical first person shooter, than is more mundane than exceptional and will probably disappoint serious gamers.Having said that, like most similar games you still want to try and finish it! While there aren't currently any cheats available, there are quite a few Youtube Walkthroughs.Borderlands Signature Series Strategy Guide (Bradygames Signature Series)Amazon Price: $5.07List Price: $19.99Borderlands CheatsExtensive Borderland Cheat CodesBorderlandsIf you combined Diablo, with Oblivion and Fallout 3 then youd probably get Borderlands. Borderlands is a no nonsense, first person shooter; it is immensely fun, with superb graphics and sound, while not as detailed as games like Oblivion or Fallout 3, it is somehow satisfying to run through the game destroying all enemies!However, if like me, you are not the best shoot-em-up player, you may need a little help to complete the game, particularly at the hard sections! Therefore, the Borderland Cheats should be used sparingly  I used the God Mode a couple of times just to get me through a difficult part, and then promptly turned it off!I note that you can spoil the game by using these codes, as it will become too easy - therefore only use them when you are stuck, and cannot move on! Civilization IV Official Strategy Guide (Official Strategy Guides (Bradygames))Amazon Price: $49.95List Price: $19.99Civilization IV CheatsCivilization IV Cheats cheat codes, FAQs, walk-throughs, hints and more.Civilization 4I first encountered the Civilization franchise on the Amiga computer and since then have been hooked. It was one of the first games that allowed you to take control of a race, build cities, empires and control the destiny of your country by (usually) military might.Civilization 4 takes the game to a whole new level with enhanced graphics and several new elements (such as religion) that make the game far more complex and yet strangely compelling. Gone are the days when simple military might is all you need to succeed - diplomacy plays a far more important role, and there are now many different ways to succeed in the game.This is a great game and a must for any collection!Dragon Age: Origins: Prima Official Game Guide (Prima Official Game Guides)Amazon Price: $43.99List Price: $24.99Dragon Age CheatsExtensive Dragon Age cheat codesDragon Age Hints and TipsDragon Age Hints and Tips - how to play the game without cheating!Dragon Age OriginsIve played most of the Roleplaying Games that are available for the PC, from the original simple AD&D games to the excellent, more recent games like The Witcher. Ive watched the games grow from simple hack and slay games into games that require thought and strategy in order to win.Dragon Age is probably one of the best games Ive played in this genre; from the makers of the highly successful game Baldurs Gate, this game really takes the whole genre to another level as it adds many elements not seen in other games.If you buy one RPG game, then make it either this one or Oblivion - you won't be sorry!Eve Online: The Second Genesis (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)Amazon Price: $9.75List Price: $19.99Best Way - Eve Online Tips and Hints | eHow.comEve Online Tips and Hints.EVE OnlineMany years ago I used to play a game called Elite. It was a superb (for the time) space exploration game that allowed you to explore the galaxy, trade goods and build a bigger and meaner space ship.Add an online element and allow the character to take on more professions (such as miner etc.), add far better graphics and ecomics and add thousands of star systems and you essentially have EVE online.This game is one of the bast sci-fi online games available, and really allows you to interact and form alliances with the online community.Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition: Prima Official Game Guide (Prima Official Game Guides)Amazon Price: $16.77List Price: $26.99Fallout 3 cheatsExtensive Fallout 3 cheat codesFallout 3Back in the old days when graphics were poor, sound was forgotten and game play consisted of isometric top down games that were fun to play but not particularly inspiring I came across a franchise that tried to change the boundaries.I played Fallout 1 & 2 for a while and loved the concept, with the innovate roleplaying system and the strategic elements of the game. Many years later, I was surprised to see a new game come out, and while I expected it to be similar to the now dated originals I was blown away by the graphics, gameplay and sheer size of Fallout 3.Unfortunately, perhaps due to my age and eyesight I found this game very difficult and had to resort to some of the Fallout 3 cheats. I did not overuse them therefore I didn't spoil my enjoyment of the game - I simply used them when I needed to get past a particularly difficult part of the game.Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the PatriotsAmazon Price: $14.20List Price: $19.99Gears of War CheatsGears of War cheat codes, FAQs, walk-throughs, hints and more.Gears of WarHaving played games like Doom for the last twenty years or so, it's no surprise that Gears of War appealed to me. With stunning graphics, a credible enemy (if locust like aliens can be credible), decent enemy AI and a convincing plot, this game stands out as one of the best of the genre.What really made this game stand out for me was the team element - it's far more enjoyable to play this game with a few friends over a network.Halo: Prima's Official Strategy GuideAmazon Price: $62.99List Price: $14.99Halo CheatsHalo cheat codes, FAQs, walk-throughs, hints and more.HaloGears of War, urmmm I mean Halo is another fantastic 3D first person shooter that over the years has pushed the boundaries of what the PC could do. While I don't think the graphics are the best out there, the gameplay is simply stunning and addictive - much like most of these games there are plenty of enemy aliens to destroy, but I mostly like the fact that I can interact with a lot of machines in this game!I also liked the ability to play games against other players - I know this is available in most of this type of game, but I seemed to do 'deathmatch' games more on Halo than any other game!Jagged Alliance 2 Official Strategies & SecretsAmazon Price: $19.99Jagged Alliance 2 CheatsJagged Alliance 2 - FAQs, walkthroughs, cheat codes and hints!Jagged AllianceOver the years I've played many different types of game - the isometric startegy games have always appealed to me and I grew up playing games like UFO and Fallout 2. Jagged Alliance was another of the genre that appealed to me, especially with the team elements that are very important.Over the years other genres have taken center stage, but I still have a huge piece of my heart set aside for games like Jagged Alliance.Kane & Lynch: Dead Men: Prima Official Game Guide (Prima Official Game Guides) (Prima Official Game Guides)Amazon Price: $0.01List Price: $19.99Kane & Lynch: Dead Men for PC CheatsKane & Lynch: Dead Men for PC - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Kane and Lynch: Dead Men After playing games like Doom, Quake, Halo etc it was interesting to see some games focusing more on the story than the simple 'destruction' - game like Kane and Lynch brought in a different feel to the genre by introduced a thick story line and strong characters.While the graphics were good it was the atmosphere created by the story that gave this game an edge.Lego Star Wars: The Complete SagaAmazon Price: $11.97List Price: $19.99Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga CheatsLego Star Wars: The Complete Saga reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Lego Star Wars: The Complete SagaI have to be honest that I've never been a huge platform game fan, however there's something fun about the Lego Star Wars series that began to change this. Firstly the graphics are fun - and depict some of my favorite all time characters from the movie. Secondly, the mix of puzzles, action and 'jumping' is about right and I found I didn't get too bored.Finally, I love the tie-in to the Lego series - seeing my nephew build some of these characters make this more enjoyable for me as I can play the game with my nephew.Madden NFL 10: Prima Official Game Guide (Prima Official Game Guides)Amazon Price: $0.61List Price: $19.99Madden NFL 2010 - cheats.Madden NFL 2010 - hints, reviews and cheats.Madden NFL 10When I was in England and Football was a game played with a round ball and no padding, I bought a simple DOS game that introduced me to the wonders of NFL- Madden became the first coach I knew.At the time the graphics were poor, but I learned a lot by randomly choosing plays and watching the overhead 'figures' play the game. As time has gone by I've watched the game develop into the 3D wonder that it is now, and the game still excites me as much now as it did back in the 80s!Need for Speed: ShiftAmazon Price: $19.99List Price: $29.99Need for Speed: Shift for PC cheats.Need for Speed: Shift for PC - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Need for Speed ShiftIn the 80sthe only Video Game that I mastered at the arcade was Pole Position - my name was always on the leaderboard. I therefore have always followed 3D racing games.Need for Speed simply astounds me with not only the amazing graphics but the ability to change and customize your car as you go along!Out of all the racing games, this one has to be my favorite - the graphics and sound are great, the physics are perfect and the game is just pure fun!Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion -- Revised & Expanded (Xbox360, PC) (Prima Official Game Guide)Amazon Price: $87.32List Price: $19.99Oblivion CheatsThere is no doubt that Oblivion is one of the best Role Playing Games to hit the PC ever; with amazing graphics, superb sound including voice and a very open and extensive game play with an excellent main...OblivionMany years ago I came across a game called Daggerfall; I had been playing PC RPGs for a while but Daggerfall was the first to really move it forward into a fully 3-D environment, with very detailed plot lines. Over the years I've watched the game develop until finally Oblivion came out.With stunning graphics, an amazing score and sound effects and a very complex main quest it became an instant hit - out of all the RPGs I've played, this is perhaps the best (Dragon Age being a close contender).It has everything you would want in a game like this; adventure, intrigue, fighting, magic and love - it really is a very extensive game and if you only buy one game in the genre I'd buy this one (or Dragon Age!).Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow (Prima Official Game Guide)Amazon Price: $198.86List Price: $16.99Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow Cheats.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow for PC - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow I have to be honest (again) but these type of graphical 'platform' style games don't usually appeal to me, but as this is based on one of my favorite movie characters, and the makers have instilled much of the humor from the movie into the game then I did enjoy it.I wasn't very good at it, and found it to be a little too frantic at times, but I enjoyed the animations and at times the game play was strangely satisfying.This is definitely worth getting to wile away the time between the next Oblivion type game!Red Orchestra - Ostrfront 41-45 - Collectors Edition (New Weapons, More Tanks, Bonus Maps, Exclusive Collectibles)Amazon Price: $23.99Quake 4 cheatsQuake 4 for PC - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Quake IVMany years ago I used to play some really fun (but poor) 3D games on the PC - Duke Nukem was one of my favorites at the time, but I soon became blown away by ID Software's Doom. As time progressed, they bought out a new game called Quake. Quake was an amazing game to play, with great graphics and a superb atmospher.Finally, Quake IV appeared on the PC and the culmination of years of design and experience provided us with the ultimate 3D hack and slay game - Quake IV introduced more than simply 'heavy weapons' but also allowed you to fight from vehicles etc - it was, for a layman like me, very difficult at times though!Resident Evil 5Amazon Price: $24.95List Price: $29.99Resident Evil 5 CheatsResident Evil 5  reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Resident Evil 5One game I am currently hooked on is a isometic game where you run around killing zombies; so games where I have to kill undead creatures greatly appeal to me! This game is an exciting 3D horror fest, filled with plenty of gore, but with an excellent story.The graphics are stunningly horrific, and the game is very frantic at times - while it's essentially another 'doom' type clone, it is by far one of the best sub-genres of the game around. The atmosphere the game sets is amazing - and thus it has become one of the best selling games of all time.Saints Row 2Amazon Price: $2.21List Price: $29.99Saints Row 2 CheatsSaints Row 2 - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Saints Row 2Saints Row 2 is one of a bunch of excellent games that have taken the whole 3D hack and slay genre and given them a twist. What I love about this game is that the story isn't linear - you are in a world where you chose where you go and control how the story develops.As you are tasked with rebuilding the Saints Row gang, you find yourself immersed in the sub-plots and characters very quickly, and while there is a lot of 'hack and slay' type gameplay, you do geta sense of achievement as you see your gang grow.Great game!Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Official Strategy Guide (Official Strategy Guides (Bradygames))Amazon Price: $3.71List Price: $17.99Transformers: Revenge of the FallenAmazon Price: $8.44List Price: $19.99THE REVENGEAmazon Price: $3.00Transformers  Leader MegatronAmazon Price: $69.99List Price: $44.99Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - CheatsTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen for - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Transformers: Revenge of the FallenYet another 3D third person shooter, this game is based on the movie of the same name. While not one of the best games around, and indeed it has been poorly received, the game does allow you to play either an Autobot or a Decepticon campaign.Perhaps the saving grace for the game is the fact that it is identifiable with the movie, and as the plot is loosely based on the movie, it does give you an extra feeling of being part of the movie!Its not my favorite game out there but it certainly has a few good part, and the graphics are generally of a high standard.Unreal Tournament 3 Signature Series GuideAmazon Price: $0.01List Price: $19.99Unreal TournamentAmazon Price: $15.99Mastering Unreal Technology, Volume I: Introduction to Level Design with Unreal Engine 3Amazon Price: $27.09List Price: $49.99Unreal Tournament Game Programming for TeensAmazon Price: $16.09List Price: $29.99Unreal Tournament 3 CheatsUnreal Tournament 3 - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Unreal Tournament 3This first person shooter really opened up the online multiplayer world for me. With many different types of online games (mostly of a capture the flag type variety) I really enjoyed the ability to team with other people and it changed the way I thought about games like this.While games like Quake did have multiplayer modes, Unreal Tournament really made it work wellThere is a fairly decent single player campaign, but mostly you should get this game if you love team based first person shooting games! With good graphics, a fine array of weapons and lots of fun, this game is a winner!Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines (Official Strategy Guide)Amazon Price: $64.50List Price: $19.99Vampire: The Masquerade - BloodlinesAmazon Price: $84.95List Price: $29.99Vampire : The Masquerade (Revised Edition)Amazon Price: $78.99List Price: $29.95Vampire: The Masquerade-Redemption Official Strategy Guide (Official Guide)Amazon Price: $19.90List Price: $19.99Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines CheatsVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Vampires The Masquerade: BloodlinesThis game was an intriguing one for me; taking the role of a vampire makes this interesting in many ways as it often gives you some moral dilemmas throughout the game. The game concentrates more on the plot than most games and overall it is a satisfying storyline; they tried to add some eroticism into the game to spice it up, but mostly this is lame and doesnt really add to the game play.Overall I did enjoy the game and found it very challenging at times; the plot flowed pretty well and I found myself returning to the game often to finish the next bit. The graphics are pretty standard for a game like this, but I do like some of the elements that specifically use a vampires abilities.Warhammer 40K Dawn of War II RetributionAmazon Price: $28.99List Price: $29.99Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II cheatsWarhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War IIX-Men Origins: Wolverine Uncaged EditionAmazon Price: $19.98List Price: $39.99X-Men Origins: Wolverine CheatsX-Men Origins: Wolverine - reviews, previews, cheats, and more.X-Men Origins: Wolverine Uncaged Edition This action adventure game is based on the recent movie; it takes you through the plotline and beyond, and allows you to use Woleverine's special powers in many different ways.I found the game to be good, although it really isn't that different from your normal action adventure type game - the only real difference being the special 'weapons' and powers you can use during gameplay.It's fun at times though.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2Amazon Price: $28.39List Price: $59.99Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 hints, tips and cheats I've been playing Call of Duty games for a while now and it still astounds me how realistic these games are. The graphics are incredible, the sound great and the action is always intense. I must admit...Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2Probably one of my favorites - this game features stunningly realistic graphics and superb and difficult gameplay. It's one of those games that you keep on coming back to, just to get to the next level!vote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...? Useful Funny Awesome Beautiful Video Games: Best RPG games for the PC (Part 1)Video Games: Divinity 2 cheatsCommentsbearclawmedia13 months ago Hey Simey, I know what you mean about the 28 pages to get to the code. Then there is the internet fraud on your card for joining the p2p, Its so boring. Thanks for taking time for others it is admirable regardless of the task. Good on you.Oh ya another good example of hubbing. Kind regards BearclawThomas Catmark13 months ago I can't say that I've never cheated in a game, but on the other hand I don't like to cheat because that can spoil the whole fun. Almost every game have a difficulty level, all you have to do is to make it easier for you, there is no need to cheat. About Civ4 - I also love the game, sometimes it is very hard for me to survive, but it is also the joy of succeeding after long turns of war and disappointments. Cheats kill the essence of gaming for me. But I respect every other opinion.SimeyC13 months ago Thomas Carmark: I totally agree with you and generally I only use cheats when I am totally stuck! Civ IV is one of my favorite games and I've never cheated on that - there is a sense of achievement when you win a game without cheating! However, for instance in one game I played recently, there was a puzzle where you had to step on certain bricks with certain characters to open a bridge - I could have spent hours working on a solution, but it was simpler and easier to search for a solution online - it saved me a lot of frustration and didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game at all!The other thing I should note is that I've been playing games for 30 years and therefore and pretty accomplished and can get through most games without trouble - some of the newer gamers don't have the experience to battle through tough games etc, so to complete a game they have to cheat - I never suggest they use a cheat permanently though - if they have a battle they can't complete - use Go mode to win that one battle and then turn God mode off...Cheeky Girl13 months ago Wow! Great Hub! HALO is a totally amazing game! The level designs are stunning! Unreal Tournament 3 is insanity. I always get so utterly creamed! It moves so darn fast! I don't get to spend much time on it, but if there's guys over, they make a bee line for the XBOX! LOL!SimeyC13 months ago Cheeky Girl: you are right about Halo! I first played it on an XBOX (not the 360) - the graphics were pretty lame to be honest, but the gameplay and the levels really impressed me and made the whole experience so much fun! I prefer to play on the PC though - I learnt to play games like this on the PC and do far better when using a ketboard rather than a controller!Albertttt13 months ago Very nice indeed.Alberthttp://hubpages.com/hub/SeinfieldSubmit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites96SimeyCFrom NJ, USA800 Followers373 HubsJoined 17 months agoRead more hubs by SimeyCContact SimeyCFollow SimeyCSubscribe to SimeyC's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk SimeyC a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsWhich was the best PC game of 2010 ?asked by ansonabey 6 days ago3 answersAnswer this questionWhat do you think about Live For Speed PC Game?asked by ieifood 2 months ago0 answersAnswer this questionRelated HubsCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 hints, tips and cheatsby SimeyCCall of Duty Modern Warfare PC reviewby Transit CamperCall of Duty Modern Warfare 2 - Game Review - Play Nowby TerryandcoHow to Crack and Play Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare...by Udog8Modern Warfare 2 PC Multiplayer Mistakesby thisisoliCall of Duty Black Ops -Modern Warfare- 7th Edition Version...by BRIAN SLATER Computer and Video Games ForumTopicRepliesfantage helpposted by rosey212 Games for Girlsposted by liamelizabeth1Host a website free for games???/posted by DCollins523Post a new topic87 more topics Tagstips pc games cheats hints fallout 3 fallout 3 cheats Recommendations  HubPagesabout uslearning centerblogaffiliatesadvertise link to this pagecopyrightCopyright  2011 Hubpages Inc. and respective owners.
