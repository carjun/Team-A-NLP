It is the result of a lot of excellent work and resourcefulness on the part of many DUers. It's the most up-to-date and comprehensive collection that I've been able to assemble. This is by no means the last word. This collection is an evolving work, as new resources are needed and discovered. If you find some new, relevant info, by all means add it in! The purpose for this is to have everything we need for emailing, faxing, phoning, and snail mailing purposes - all easily located in ONE master thread. From time to time, I've added a few choice comments and testimonials from other DUers regarding the critical importance of making your opinions known to the media and to policy makers and others in positions of influence or leadership, for motivational purposes. Please note, this thread is NEW AND IMPROVED, and is meant to REPLACE earlier similar threads.After all...IF THEY THINK WE DON'T CARE, THEY WON'T, EITHER!!Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadPart One: The Original ListcalimaryJul-09-04 12:39 PM#1hi calimary! just a quick repair usa today feedback link:nofurylikeAug-01-04 04:33 PM#37Deleted messageName removedNov-11-04 11:56 AM#96Deleted messageName removedNov-11-04 01:37 PM#97Part One, FIRST ADD: Look what Maraya1969 found (I wanted this up top)calimaryJun-07-05 08:23 AM#127Sent letter to my Rep's/Senators, Face the Nation CNNAuntiBushJul-01-05 04:18 PM#136Smother Big Brother, use this in your signature file!doohickeyAug-25-06 09:35 PM#168find your SENATORS senate.govjarnocanJun-19-06 09:09 AM#164How about a list of ammo providers?alvarezadamsJul-20-06 01:34 PM#167USE THIS: stand up and fight against McCain lies!UnitedWeStand33Nov-02-08 04:09 PM#195Part  Two: The anarchy1999 list - media companies and peoplecalimaryJul-09-04 12:41 PM#2Part  Three: "Editor & Publisher" listcalimaryJul-09-04 12:43 PM#3Part Four: The maggrwaggr collectioncalimaryJul-09-04 12:44 PM#4Part Five: UN Contact InfocalimaryJul-09-04 12:45 PM#5Part Six: House and Senate Contact Info:calimaryJul-09-04 12:46 PM#6some fixesbigtreeJul-11-05 07:12 AM#146Part Seven: The misanthrope collectioncalimaryJul-09-04 12:48 PM#7Parrt Eight: Disney infocalimaryJul-09-04 12:49 PM#8Most management at Disney can be contacted via email using theLorienAug-19-05 10:07 PM#152NOTE: UPDATED 9/7/06, see Part Sixty below.calimarySep-08-06 12:06 AM#170Part Nine: Theater contactscalimaryJul-09-04 12:51 PM#9I'm busy copying/pasting all of this: Then format...AuntiBushJul-01-05 04:30 PM#137Part  Ten: Quick and EasycalimaryJul-09-04 12:52 PM#10Part Ten: First Add (thank you, Pallas180)calimaryJul-11-04 04:25 PM#13Part Eleven: California governmentcalimaryJul-10-04 12:16 AM#11From DUer Bleachers7 - NEW YORK DAILY NEWS INFOcalimaryJul-10-04 12:18 AM#12Part Twelve: Senate Intelligence Committee InfocalimaryJul-15-04 12:37 PM#14Part Thirteen: Slim-fast Contact Info:calimaryJul-15-04 12:39 PM#15And don't forget 1 800 SLIM-FAST.calimaryJul-15-04 11:44 PM#18Part Fourteen: How to send SAFE SNAIL MAILcalimaryJul-15-04 12:42 PM#16Part Fifteen: Why Answer Those Pesky, Biased, Conservative Emails:calimaryJul-15-04 01:08 PM#17make your rebuttal countfrankieAug-06-04 02:24 PM#49This fantastic, Mary , ThanksCapn SunshineJul-18-04 01:37 PM#19yesyesyesssssssss!buycitgoJul-18-04 07:32 PM#20Thanks so much, Calimary.KukesaJul-21-04 09:00 AM#21Part Sixteen: VITAL, EXCELLENT - Military Families Speak Out and more:calimaryJul-21-04 11:41 AM#22Addition:Cookie wookieJul-02-05 01:56 PM#142Part Seventeen: Joseph Wilson Contact Info:calimaryJul-21-04 04:44 PM#23Part Eighteen: Clear Channel Communications Info:calimaryJul-21-04 06:23 PM#24Part Nineteen: Congressional Black Caucus info - July, 2004:calimaryJul-22-04 07:38 PM#25Can we do anything else next month?WinterStormJul-25-04 03:04 AM#26Part Twenty: Cable "News" Channels CONTACT LIST:calimaryJul-26-04 07:36 PM#27FAUX kickKeirseyJul-30-04 07:14 PM#28Thank you thank you thank you, and more, calimary!

Write your letter on a piece of 8 1/2 X 11 inch paper. Fold it three ways, as though you were about to insert it into a conventional envelope. Then tape it shut - ONLY ONCE, in the middle, so both sides are open and it is CLEARLY easy to see there's nothing in there but words on paper. Write the address on the back, with your return address, just as though it were on a conventional envelope. Then stamp and send. The more obviously non-threatening it is, the less trouble you'll have, and the more likely it'll get delivered. c) if possible, CC the letter to others, so the recipient knows that other eyes are also seeing the same thing. I read a story more than a year ago about a woman who objected to the New York Times' lowballing of crowd size at war protests. She complained, in writing to the times. She also CC'ed the letter to the Washington Post, and I believe, to the Editor & Publisher website. That way, when the New York Times got it, they also saw that others, INCLUDING their prime competitor, got the same thing, and probably were enjoying seeing the enemy chastised, being caught in a mistake. A correction was issued very quickly thereafter. This was in response to complaints about the Times' underestimating crowd size from other protestors who were there and didn't like seeing their huge numbers being discounted, with their complaints ignored and nothing done to rectify it. ---------------------Good Motivator:"IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING...make a phone call or send a paper letter.

YOU MUST NEVER LET THEM GET THE LAST WORD. EVER. Here's how you do that (at least it's worked for me):You send a rebuttal. Whatever rebuttal it is. Either point by point, or overall. Posting here on DU to get ideas or suggested responses is a GREAT approach. People come up with GOOD, and USABLE answers here, based on lots of research and reading, lots of time having been spent arguing these things out with their friends and purportedly well-intentioned Kool-aid drinkers. An especially helpful resource for a newbie - LET US HELP YOU. You send that rebuttal to the person who sent the original offending email to you. THEN, you send that same rebuttal to EVERY PERSON ON THE LIST OF RECIPIENTS that included the person who sent the original offending email to you. Your rebuttal should go to whoever sent it to THAT person, and everybody else in that round of emailings. After that, you may want to retrace it an additional step back, and further send your rebuttal to the people on the list of the person who sent the email to the person who sent it to you, etc. The point is: THEY ALL SEE the response to the foolish, misbegotten, ill-informed, and SLANTED attack they all originally saw. You will accomplish the following: a) You will set the record straight. b) You will make sure the GOOD GUYS GET THE LAST WORD. Our opponents are COUNTING ON our staying mute. They want us to remain "The Silenced Majority," that won't speak up, that won't object, that won't question their motives or their berzerko information or their agenda, and that will just let any idiotic crap stand, as is, unchallenged. If it's unchallenged and unrefuted, IT IS THEN ASSUMED THAT IT IS TRUE - merely because there is no challenge or rebuttal to it. c) You may actually give somebody their first taste at an opposing view (in this case, once again, THE TRUTH) that they are obviously not getting now. Consider the example of all the people whose eyes were opened by many things they NEVER saw before, which were laid out for all the world to see in "Fahrenheit 9/11." All those other recipients are probably on some wrong-winger's list, and get this stuff repeatedly, and since they move in that alternate universe, they can't be expected to be exposed to anything outside that narrow agenda. It's the same situation with all those people who think if they just watch the Pox "News" network, or listen to limbaugh, they'll get the truth - not even realizing there are other points of view available out there (albeit harder to find for those who don't bother to or don't know to try looking). d) You may VERY LIKELY stop the offending emails from darkening your cyber-door. I did this with two different people who were sending me this dreck. Not once, since taking action, have I received ANY further emails like those. In fact, those two now confine their emails to me - strictly to more harmless social and joke stuff. You HAVE TO respond. You can't just leave it hanging out there. Unless you don't mind if they keep coming.

Everybody on our side, I guess, was perhaps stunned that people would say this stuff to begin with, because it's NOT NICE, or perhaps it's because they felt it was too important to take the high road, or that they had misplaced confidence in the masses to be able to see through or doubt the lies or know enough, already, to recognize lies. There's also the "we don't want to lower ourselves to fighting on their level. That makes us become like them" argument. Perhaps the "we'll wait it out and they'll come to their senses, or people will get bored with it, or it's just a passing fad" theory was it. And then, of course, after 9/11, we were told that if we didn't support "Our President" blindly and mutely, or asked ANY questions, we were "unAmerican," "unpatriotic," "appeasers," "Saddam-lovers," "terrorist sympathizers," "Neville Chamberlains," and worse. Result: there's only one "party line" being spoken of, quoted, written about, exhorted, or spun. If you never hear anything different, how could you possibly imagine that anything MIGHT be different? If you couldn't see outside, and only heard people talking about a yellow sky, and you NEVER heard anything other than this, what would you conclude about the color of the sky? So this shit has been allowed to perpetuate, unchecked. And it's a shame. No. It's a SIN. That's why so many Americans still believe Saddam had something to do with 9/11. That's why a recent study showed that people who watched the Pox "news" network actually thought not only this, but that WMDs HAD in fact been found in Iraq. It's only since Howard Dean, and then Howard Stern, and then Michael Moore, with Dennis Kucinich in there for good measure, that people have had the courage to start speaking out and saying "Hey, WAIT JUST A MINUTE!" when some of this crap gets spewed. Was DU always more than 40-thousand members strong? No. It started WAY small. And it grew. It grew because more people got more uneasy and upset about it, and realized, miraculously, that they were not alone. Come to think of it, they've basically kept us in a hostage hold for all this time. Silencing us. Demonizing and marginalizing us. Isolating us in conditions where all we hear is their non-stop propaganda, as though they were giving us the "smoke-out-Manuel-Noriega" treatment. It's only recently that we've found the strength and courage and American-ness in us to stand up, rip off the gags and blindfolds, and start fighting back. It reminds me of Jeff Goldblum's great line in the first "Jurassic Park" movie - marveling at how "life finds a way." Well, so does the truth. Here are the MECHANICS of responding to these knuckle-dragger emails, either pro-bush or anti-Clinton (anti-Democrat, anti-liberal).You send a rebuttal back - packed with facts (you can find PLENTY of excellent, well-written, well-researched ammo here). You send it to the person who sent it to you. THEN, you send it to the personS who sent it to THEM. Since I'm not very sophisticated in this regard, I wind up cut-n-pasting a lot. I copy the "to" list from the email I received, and paste that into the "to" space in my own reply. So ALL those people who got the original lies and misrepresentations and bullshit GET MY REPLY ALSO. Sometimes I've even gone a step or two back, even from THERE! So you set straight the person who sent this crap to you, and the person who sent it to him/her (and everybody else), AND the people who sent it to THOSE folks, and the people who sent it to THOSE folks, etc. And guess what? I DO NOT GET emails like this ANY MORE. And maybe, just maybe, I've reached, or enlightened someone and compelled them to stop and think for a change. Maybe they never saw or heard any of this before (especially if all they see/hear is the crap from the Pox "news" network or the limbaugh contingent. I know at least I set the record straight, and didn't let the bad guys and their lies get the last word. Seriously. These emails have never darkened my electronic door since I began doing this. And I only had to do it twice. They don't like it? TOUGH SHIT. I don't like getting LIES. I don't like it when they send crap to me. Perhaps they just don't understand how it feels, or what it's like, to RECEIVE lying crap emails. Maybe, just maybe, it's never happened to them.

I need help framing good emails.Can anyone write a little something I can use to begin framing a basic email that get's straight to the point but in a way that will grasp at their hearts?I will change the wording around, which goes without saying on my end. I've been sitting here all afternoon writing and can't get it out right. Feeling like an idiot. So, HELP! Please.P.S. I called my local phone company & internet provider, VERIZON! Well,  I got a Customer Service rep that got an earful from me. I mean I went from the elections on up to now. VERIZON merged with MSNBC. Already I had deleted their browser and stopped using the email account from them. But this time I took action, thanks to this motivation from Skinner and Will.Guess what! This wonderful Verizon rep held-on, said "go ahead, get it off your chest." I did and boy did I - 1 whole hour! He kept telling me it was "ok," and "he understood." And as shocking as it may seem, he told me (IMPORTANT HERE) they hear ALL THE TIME from REPUBLICAN/CHRISTIAN NUTS, but never from the other side (Democrats).He went on to tell me that while he was an Independent, he too did not like what was going on, nor did most in his department and mentioned lately he's afraid to talk about his opinions against the Neo-Cons and Republicans where ever he goes. He "thanked me" for giving him the best conversation he's had in eons and was "grateful" I talked to him in great lengthy with regards to what's going on in our country.Shew... you see, THEY DO NOT want to LOOSE CUSTOMERS. Aw-ha! But, this guy was sincere. I mean really, really sincere. He gave me tips on how to find good freeware firewall/virus/privacy protection and pretty much hinted that using the ones I got are monitored for "marketing purposes." He emailed me safer ones. Can't wait to open my emails.So, MSNBC - ta-ta! Till you start being fair, you just lost a customer. Time to put it on my blog!Ok... done ranting. Can anyone help me w/a letter or expression-al format?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcalimary      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jul-31-04 04:47 PMResponse to Original message32.Part Twenty-Three: IMRadioactive's GREAT advice for letter-writers:From one who worked in "the media" a couple of thoughts here as I enjoy this string.First, and one that can never be overstated to those on DU call or write. Do so with style. No name calling, and also avoid using obvious political terms that make you sound more like a robot than an individual. Also, be sure to use your REAL name. I've been amazed to get emails of flames to CNN or whomever and it's signed by "Stinging Spider"...sorry, that cred may be cool on message boards, but this is just like sending a resume or an appeal.Remember, these networks get a ton of mail every day and the email flood this past week on both networks, good and bad, were probably at very high levels. I somewhat pity the poor operators at CNN as they get an earful from many of us, and also wingnuts who, believe it or not, think the coverage is "too liberal". Look at the Freeper threads complaining how many Democrats there were being interviewed at the Democratic convention (doh!).I always try to make the argument with the assumption CNN has already had a ton of hate email and calls and are pretty much numb to the same old criticisms. If anything it may embolden them as if there are as many negative calls from the right (or even half as many as the left) it's assumed then the reporting is balanced. Nuance means nothing.When you write, attempt to be as "pithy" (I hate that word now) and specific. If there's a specific slam Judy Woof Woof makes or there's a segment that has 3 Conservatives and no Democrat, note the time and the people on the tube. They keep logs of all this stuff that then makes it easier, if someone does take an interest in your bitch, to review the incident in question and be able to reply.We're not going to change CNN all of a sudden...it took years for them to slide into the whorehouse they are now (and this said by an over 20 year viewer...BTW, always mention how long you've viewed them...and be honest), but at least it'd be nice to see some folks here get responses rather than frustrated.Again, no slams at those who feel the need to vent, and sometimes a flaming email is better than beating up the TV, but I also rarely see responses here from all these flames. I do see them from very straight forward letters that create specific reference points that can be used to continue the discussion.Definitely call MSNBC and even CNN when they do something good...as 1 person will call to say something good while 100 will call when something is bad...you tell me who gets remembered? You get a lot more flies with honey than vinegar.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnofurylike      (1000+ posts)Sun Aug-01-04 01:30 AMResponse to Reply #3235.outstanding advice, calimary! please keep on your vital work! n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbenfranklin1776      (1000+ posts)      Sun Aug-01-04 03:21 PMResponse to Original message36.KickPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnofurylike      (1000+ posts)Sun Aug-01-04 04:40 PMResponse to Original message38.kick n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbenfranklin1776      (1000+ posts)      Mon Aug-02-04 12:43 PMResponse to Original message39.KickPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topproud patriot      (1000+ posts)      Tue Aug-03-04 02:12 PMResponse to Original message40.kickPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcalimary      (1000+ posts)      Wed Aug-04-04 12:04 PMResponse to Original message41.Part Twenty-Four: SEND A FREE FAX!SEND A FREE FAX TO YOUR REPS, THANKS TO THE ACLU (and Pallas180)http://www.aclu.org/Privacy/Privacy.cfm?ID=11323&c=130 (Note: this is a specific ACLU alert, but every time they issue one to email subscribers, this feature is included!)Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcalimary      (1000+ posts)      Wed Aug-04-04 12:08 PMResponse to Original message42.Part Twenty-Five: Contacts for NEWSWORTHY V.I.P.sEdited on Wed Aug-04-04 01:03 PM by calimaryMICHAEL MOORE: http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/diary /Email info: http://www.michaelmoore.com/email/index.php Homeland Security *If you have an idea for Mike's Office of Homeland Security, send your suggestions to homelandsecurity@michaelmoore.com Links *If you have an idea or suggestion for our Links section, please send your suggestions to links@michaelmoore.comNews *If you have an idea or suggestion for our News or Must Read section, please contact news@michaelmoore.com WebmasterFor technical inquires about the site, bug reports or questions about the mailing list please contact admin@michaelmoore.com Contacting MichaelIf you have something you want to tell Michael directly, contact him at: mike@michaelmoore.com .

E-mails are quick and cheap and don't carry the weight of a phone call or a PAPER LETTER. Paul Begala says a hundred paper letters would change the direction of a news program."  DUer grasswire, 5/20/04And let me just add - I was in radio for a lot of years. I saw, for myself, how effective input from listeners could be, and how seriously management took it. There was this one time...I worked at a big station here in L.A. I was part of the "morning team." Because the morning jock's ratings were not going absolutely through the roof (but were MIGHTY respectable, even so, thank you very much), the GM thought he should tinker with the show. He brought in a friend of his who was this weird little guy who kept sniffing all the time, and always looked like he'd just rolled out of bed. He was some sort of "comedy writer" whose credentials were - uh - let's just say underwhelming. This guy brought in a couple of people, his "partners," to work with him. They wrote all these bits and had all these characters and routines, and got rolling. They were quite horrible, and absolutely NOT funny. The reaction was INSANE and IMMEDIATE. People HATED IT! Listeners called in and complained. The next day, MORE listeners called in and complained. The next day, EVEN MORE listeners called up and complained. This went on through the week. By the following Monday, you NEVER would even have known that anything unusual or different had happened on the morning show the week before. All gone. Bye-bye. Not a trace. Management COULD NOT ignore the verdict, or the wishes, of our listeners. -----------------Then there was this other time, at another station. I was doing a late night talk show, Sunday night, midnight to 2. The guy who came on after me would take it from 2 to 6 am when the morning drive jock got started. This guy was a far more experienced talk show host than I, and always worked up a show that switched topic (as was TOTALLY fitting and proper, by the way), and steered it like a pro. He was VERY talented, and he did a good job. And every Sunday night/Monday morning, this is how it went. But then, Elvis died. The following Sunday night, I planned to do an Elvis show. Two hours, the phone banks were loaded and unstoppable. You could get a suntan by the light they put out. EVERYBODY wanted to talk about Elvis. My colleague arrived and, as 2 am approached, we did a crosstalk segment as usual and he promoed the new topic he had all planned out. The listeners were having none of this. When I signed off and he came on, they STILL wanted to talk about Elvis. At 3 am they STILL wanted to talk about Elvis. No matter WHAT the host said or did or tried, no matter how clever and provocative he was to tease the topic HE wanted to talk about, the listeners DID NOT want to play. By 4 am, he gave up. Opened the mike, mentioned how he'd really wanted to talk about something else, "but, hey, if you guys wanna talk about Elvis, well, then, that's what we're gonna have to do." AGAIN, the listeners spoke. And yep, they wanted to keep on talking about Elvis, so that's what happened, straight through til the end of the show. The station, and the decision-maker in question, were both COMPELLED to pay attention. ---------------------Then, there was this other time, at still another station, when big shakeups had started, yet again. They'd just fired the news director and I was her replacement (especially since I was the only one left in the news department). We had a morning-and-noon news shift, and an afternoon news shift.  I was still doing mornings. My predecessor had handled afternoons. The program director began stopping by my office to tell me that I should get somebody in for the afternoon news shift who could just fill a hole TEMPORARILY, because since they'd made some staffing reductions, they would NOT be keeping the afternoon news shift. I made up my mind that the news department was NOT going to be cut back on MY watch, like so many other music-oriented stations had recently experienced. I found a VERY talented young woman with a great voice and superb writing skills (who later went on to an impressive career as a screen-writer), whose work I really liked, so I hired her. I kept my fingers crossed that they'd like her enough to shut up about cutting back the news department. No dice. As good and creative as she was, the PD still kept to his habit of stopping by my office, EVERY morning, to remind me - "remember, afternoons are temporary." This was REALLY getting to be annoying! After about a month, I realized, much to my disgust, that I wasn't going to win this, and decided I better find an even stronger card to play. Suddenly, I thought of this guy who'd been on the air on a similar station a few years earlier, who'd been SO popular and had such a phenomenal connection to his audience (not to mention some Golden Mike awards and a delivery to die for), but who'd sort of disappeared from the L.A. radio landscape. I decided to try to find him to see if he could save my afternoon shift.  I finally tracked him down in some obscure corner of Hollywood, where he'd been out of the business for a couple of years. Called him up, pitched him the job, and he was VERY interested, so I hired him. The VERY FIRST DAY HE WENT ON THE AIR at our place, it was as though the trumpets had sounded and the Walls of Jericho came tumbling down! The phones lit up like gangbusters. ALL DAY LONG. This guy really had a following - the response was staggering! People all over Southern California had missed him, and were thrilled to hear him back on the air again. And they didn't hesitate to say so.I noticed one more thing: those daily visits by the program director to remind me that they were about to phase out the afternoon news - STOPPED, COLD. When I eventually moved on from there, myself, the afternoon news shift was still intact. ------------------------Then, there was this OTHER time... when a SINGLE mention of me, by name, from a listener, actually saved my job at a station where new management (and a new program director) had taken over and were house-cleaning just about EVERY holdover from the previous regime). You've heard of the Arbitron ratings service. Arbitron has one, in particular, called the "ARB Talkback." It features specific comments from listeners about the radio stations for which they filled out ratings diaries. Some fellow wrote in, singling me out, personally, for doing "entertaining morning news." When that came out, it was passed around all over the radio station. And funny enough, from then on, NOBODY TOUCHED ME. I survived the bloodletting and stayed on, undisturbed, for about a year longer than I otherwise would have. ------------------------I experienced lots of incidents like this, either personally, or second-hand, through other friends and colleagues with their own versions of this kind of story at other stations and networks. I'm here to tell you this stuff really happens. I SWEAR TO YOU, if viewers/listeners/readers make a big enough fuss, there is NO way they can be ignored. It's just a question of making a fuss BIG ENOUGH.

AS SOON AS I SAID I had seen an article in the New York Times about the "swift boat swifties," and their lies, she said - "oh yes, I've heard ALL ABOUT THAT!" Furthermore, it took a LONG time to get in, after I'd pressed 8 to bypass the recorded message. So clearly, they're getting the message. What they DO about it is another matter. But FIRST, AND MOST CRITICALLY IMPORTANT, they have to get the message. This stuff is working. Slow but sure. Seems a little too slow at times, but what's the alternative - that we sit back and do NOTHING, and just hope maybe they'll find it in their hearts to do the correct thing?You guys know what to do...Obviously, you are already doing it.

Freeper)WASHINGTON  It was the first public allegation that CBS News used forged memos in its report questioning President Bush's National Guard service  a highly technical explanation posted within hours of airtime citing proportional spacing and font styles.But it did not come from an expert in typography or typewriter history as some first thought. Instead, it was the work of Harry W. MacDougald, an Atlanta lawyer with strong ties to conservative Republican causes who helped draft the petition urging the Arkansas Supreme Court to disbar President Clinton after the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Times has found.The identity of "Buckhead," a blogger known previously only by his screen name on the site freerepublic.com and lifted to folk hero status in the conservative blogosphere since last week's posting, is likely to fuel speculation among Democrats that the efforts to discredit the CBS memos were engineered by Republicans eager to undermine reports that Bush received preferential treatment in the National Guard more than 30 years ago.Republican officials have denied any involvement among those debunking the CBS story.http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/2004/la-091704buck ...

Bush said he served honourably and if he had been called up he would have gone to Vietnam; here's a chance for his kids and other pro-Bush parent's kids to fight for their country.Operation "Enlist Republicans" should be done agressively over the next weeks so that people who vote for Bush realize that War is not something that is fought by other people for their benefit. If they think the War in Iraq is about defending this country, which it obviously wasn't given all the reports, then they should volunteer to fight in it unless they are cowards. If all people who vote for Bush enlist to go to Iraq, then those people who support Kerry and don't believe the Iraq war was entered into honestly won't have to ... here are the links:Army: http://www.goarmy.com/contact/send_for_info.jsp Marines: http://www.marines.com/request/contact_recruiter_reques... P.S. Be sure to find the names and details of your pro-Bush Republican congressmen and women and senators as well - their children should not be exempt. It's called practicing what you preach and they should learn to do it.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopBUSHOUT      (1000+ posts)Sat Oct-16-04 03:08 PMResponse to Original message82.The Sinclair TOP TEN LIST....I've decided I don't like the automated email thing being promoted now.It will appear to be spam, thus undermining our efforts.Going to a place like the top ten list and writing your OWN email with your OWN subject and MANUALLY sending it will be much more effective!Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcalimary      (1000+ posts)      Sat Oct-16-04 05:40 PMResponse to Reply #8284.This is a good point, actually.If you do use some of these automated email mechanisms, by all means consider any options presented that allow you to customize your email.

It's for ANYBODY who is feeling ANY sense of overwhelm about the size of the overall task we face. FLOWERS TO YOU, wildflower. This just might be THE best advice on this thread. XOXOXOXO!  Everybody take note: To disabled/chronically ill DUers: 11 things we can doAs a disabled/chronically ill person, I often feel that I'm not doing enough. I can't be out there canvassing the way those on the ground are. But each of us has our gifts, and combined, we can all make a difference. Every action matters!So I came up with a list of things that we can do to help the democrats this fall. Even if it's just one small act a day, every bit helps. (See my sig line.)And to those of you who are physically well and out pounding the pavement: please remember we are doing our best--and I want to thank you for everything you're doing!11 THINGS WE CAN DO1. Write/call/e-mail someone in the local or national media to express your opinion or give positive feedback.2. Write/call/e-mail a local congressman.3. Write/call/e-mail an organization such as Sinclair or one of its advertisers.4. Post to DU something to uplift morale. Sometimes people on DU say things like, "Why are you posting here and not out canvassing?" I believe this forum serves many important purposes. One of these is building morale. When our morale suffers, it affects turnout. Thus quotes, good news, reminders, and uplifting articles can make a difference.5. Post a flyer, Web info page, or article you have found on the Internet, in order to help people canvassing. (And if you are able, distribute them yourself in other ways.)6. Make a flyer and post it.7. Write an article and post it.8. If you're not in a swing state, post on a forum in a swing state. There have been useful posts here containing links to these forums.9. If you can, donate money to the DNC, Moveon.org, or the K-E legal fund (https://contribute.johnkerry.com/gelac.html?ref=EBlDH_w ... ).10. If you're able, distribute movies such as Farenheit 9/11 and Going Upriver any way you can. For example, send them to your local library.11. On days you're too ill to do anything: meditate or pray. Even if you are skeptical, studies have shown the effects of prayer, so my view is that it couldn't hurt. And meditation helps calm and rejuvenate me.Please feel free to add to this!-wildflowerON EDIT: Some may be able to do only one or two of the things on this list; I know there are several I can't normally do because of my illness. But if there is just one thing each of us can do per day...well, again, Mother Theresa says it better than I (see my sig):"Just one, one, one...So you begin...I begin. I picked up one person - maybe if I didn't pick up that person I wouldn't have picked up 42,000...Just begin...one, one, one." - Mother Theresahttp://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.ph...

In Ohio you can open your front door and see questions about voting fraud and voting irregularities face to face.  While Jesse Jackson has walked to the front of the bus to question the voting process in Ohio, Unitarian Universalists everywhere have been silent.  Suffice it say that this is NOT an UU tradition!  The mainstream media has not covered the concerns about the vote this does not mean that UUs shouldnt be concerned!Voters across America urge Ohio UUs and the entire Unitarian Universalist Association to volunteer for the recount in Ohio, to make a statement to the press concerning the vote in Ohio and other states which suffered significant voting irregularities, and to get involved with making every vote count. The League of Women Voters, the General Accounting Office, Common Cause, and many other organizations see enough voting irregularities to be cause for concern.  Unitarian Universalists should too.  American voters who cant be in Ohio also urge UUs to attend the following rally. RALLY! "Investigate all 88 counties, Litigate, Re-Count, RecuseSaturday, December 4th,Columbus, OH1:00 PM,Ohio Statehouse LawnEast Broad & South High Streets,Columbus, OhioWe demand that every vote be counted accurately from the Nov 2nd election. We demand a full re-count of Ohio's votes and a thorough investigation of all reported irregularities and discrepancies and charges of voter disenfranchisement throughout the state. The right to vote is a civil right and in a democracy no abridgement of that right can be tolerated. In Kiev, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators are on the streets, staying there overnight in the bitter cold, bringing the government to a halt and the world to attention, refusing to let democracy die.

Each one of us that stone that is tossed into the pond, each one of us tossing stones into the pond that is DU. We come here to learn, to share, to vent and to encourage and our actions, our posts, our arguments and our agreements ripple out and touch each other just as we are touched by the ripples of others.We are a grassroots community made up of people that believe in some basic principles -- Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We see our world as precious and we see how frail it is. We recognize that we cannot change the world on our own; we know that there is strength in numbers and we each try our best to improve our corner of the world. We strive for acceptance, not just of our ideals and ourselves, but also for others and their values and their views. We long for the nation we once knew, one that was the model of democracy for all others to follow and aspire to be like. In these last few years we have seen forces that seem beyond our control warp and distort everything we have held dear. We have been told that we are the minority and they have used our patriotism as a weapon against us and they have battered us like an abusive spouse, telling us with each blow to our liberties if you love me, you will take it, I abuse you because I love you and I know what is best for you. But we dont believe them. We know it is about control and not love. It is about power and not justice. So we come here to remind each other and ourselves that we are not alone, that we are not the minority. We gather strength from each other and we share ideas. Because of the ripples we make in the pond, because of the ripples that touch us, we are willing to stand up and call them on their lies, we are armed with the truth. For we know what true love of country is and we know we are patriots.We, the members of the grassroots community of DU, have made a difference and we will continue to do so. In January, we shut down congress telephones as we flooded the switchboards with calls and faxes and emails demanding someone stand with Conyers and Tubb-Jackson to oppose the certification of the Ohio votes. No, we didnt change the outcome, but we made them hear us and we made them take notice. Our ripples were felt.We must continue to do, to try, to share and to encourage. We must continue to reach out to each other and to reach for the stars. To not try is to be complicit in their crimes; to not try is to enable their evil, to encourage their corruption. We must continue to toss the stones into the ponds, we must continue to allow the ripples formed to carry us beyond their myths and beyond ourselves.We have made a difference. In a weeks time we have raised almost $35,000 to help a member of our community afford surgery necessary to save his life. We have pinched our pennies, given what we can and extended our hands and our love, our prayers and our positive energies to one of our own. As we reach out to help one man, as we unite to help Andy, our single efforts have had a ripple effect that we never expected, creating ripples that we can never count. The grassroots effort has been strengthened, the DU community united and our love has been multiplied a hundred times over. Our faith in humanity has been restored, our belief in each other and ourselves renewed, as we reach out to help someone we love. With laughter and determination, with humor and wit, we have reached out to help a friend and we will attain our goal. For we know that with faith and love (and laughter), all things are possible. Our efforts continue and we continue to throw our stones into the ponds, hoping our ripples will join together to form the waves of relief so necessary. Not just for Andy but for our nation, for justice, for election reform, for health care, for civil rights for all, for all of the causes we each hold so dear, our environment, our freedoms, our children, our future and for peace.I stand united with you all, I am proud to be a member of this community. Your ripples have touched me in ways that I will never adequately be able to express and your ripples have given me the courage to toss my own stones into the pond, to cause more ripples, to try to make a difference, to try to save my corner of the world.Bless you all . . .   I DU Believe!   (((((((((((((((((((((((Ripple Effect)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.ph ... http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.ph...

Then, I called the DNC at 202-863-8000 and left a message with the Chairman's office, who seemed eager to get on it.Let's all do the same, and then watch to see what happens.

And while you're studying that reality-judiciously, as you will-we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."

All of them entered the country legally on a temporary visa, mostly tourist visas with entry permits for six months.  Although four of them attended flight school in the United States, only one is known to have entered on an appropriate visa for such study, and one entered on an F-1 student visa.  Besides the four pilots, all but one of the terrorists entered the United States only once and had been in the country for only three to five months before the attacks. The four pilots had been in the United States for extended periods, although none was a legal permanent resident. Some had received more than one temporary visa, most of which were currently valid on September 11, but at least three of them had fallen out of status and were, therefore, in the United States illegally.The terrorists  had obtained U.S. identification that was used for boarding flights in the form of Florida, Virginia, California and New Jersey drivers licenses/ID cards. One of the terrorists, Mohamed Atta, was detained in Florida for driving without a license, but subsequently obtained one. Thirteen of the terrorists had Florida drivers licenses or ID cards, seven had Virginia drivers licenses, at least two had California licenses and two had New Jersey drivers licenses. According to the March 28, 2002 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Robert Thibadeau, director of Carnegie Mellon's Internet Security labratory, says that "the 19 terrorists on Sept. 11 were holding 63 state driver's licenses for identification."In the probe of the attack, numerous other people with potential connections to the hijackings have been detained for immigration violations.DU thread:Does someone have a list of the nationalities of 911 hijackers?http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.ph...

There are 26 states in which such laws have been established leaving 24 states in which an effort is required to petition the state legislature for enactment of such a law or alternatively where the initiative has been made law to use that vehicle to bring each state of the nation into a parity of power of its citizens to control the Federal government.Link for those less legally minded to understand the scope of this siteStatus of the lawsuitClick on http://foundersfreedomdefensefund.blogspot.com  />>>>snipObjectives of We the PeopleTo kick George W. Bush out of office, send him packing to Crawford Texas and to seek his future trial for war crimes in the docks of the International Court of Criminal Justice. To this add Dick Cheney and his rogue companions. That We the People gain control over the Senate and House of Representatives whereby they are bound to perform according to their commitments to We the People or get booted out of office by state court upon complaint of We the People. To teach the President and the Congress that We the People own America and the government and that every person in each of those entities is in our employ and subject to our termination by way of our reserved electoral right of recall. To establish that the right of the people to recall members of the US Senate or the House of Representatives is a right not prohibited within the Constitution and is thus reserved to the electors of the States contrary to common myth. To firmly establish the right of We the People to veto any acts of the Congress within 48 hours of passage which veto is final and cannot be overridden by the Congress. To establish by use of the recall that We the People are the backbone of our government, not its vassals and that the government must respond to the will of We the People. Not the last and not the least is that we must re-establish fiscal responsibility to this nation which is heading for bankruptcy under the present administration with the aid and assistance of our congressional delegates. We the people of the United States face the greatest challenge in the history of our countryIt is greater than the Revolutionary war by which our country was given birth. It is greater than the Civil war which preserved the union. It is greater than World War II which was waged to eliminate the evils of fascism from the earth. It is unprecedented in world history! It is indeed a rebirth of fascism in our time in our own country by those who have hijacked the government from their seat in the Administration and by their accomplices within the Congress along with all other inept members of the Congress who have allowed this tragedy to come upon us. Most of these are descendants of fathers who fought and some who died in World War II to free the world of fascism. Dont know what PNAC is? Most Americans dont. Read up on it http://www.crisispapers.org/Editorials/PNAC-Primer.htm How did it happen? By lies and deception and by placing the Nation under a state of fear. But not by accident. It was a well orchestrated event including 9/11 and all the suspicions surrounding it. For 9/11 was a needed event ( As stated by the paper itself) ( Sin of Omission) to implement the Project for the New American Century (PNAC) and first kicked into gear by the ill-informed interference of the US Supreme Court in a States Right matter of the election fraud in Florida in 2000. That interference resulted in an illegal electoral college vote for George W. Bush. It was further encouraged in 2004 by a conspiracy of silence among members of the Congress on both sides of the aisle to not speak of fascism or PNAC during the election campaign which they knew or must have known was taking over America. Members of Congress who knew and were silent are guilty of treason and high crimes against the country. If they didnt know they are inept and should be kicked out of their offices as quickly as possible. We dont need a rubber stamp congress to the further the evil empire builder George W. Bush. I wont go into the parallels between September 11, 2001 and February 27,1933 when Germany began to lose its democracy and the Third Reich fascist government began. Thom Hartman has done an excellent job of that. Thom Hartman | When Democracy Failed - 2005: The Warnings of History http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0222-22.htm We cannot allow George Bush and company to entrench our country any deeper into the un-godly agenda of PNAC. Every American needs to stand up, listen, read and learn what is going on then decide to do something positive about it. I have suggested an:American Revolution 2005It needs to be done beginning now and by our use of the powers vested in WE the People Volunteers needed in all 50 states. If you have the spirit of Americas founders and wish to participate in a non-violent recapture of the freedoms associated with the founding of America, please step forward and make yourself known.

Any power not enumerated in the Constitution is reserved to the people. Recall is one of those powers.In those states where there is a law establishing procedure to invoke the recall, it is available to the people to initiate it. In those states where it is not procedurally established by law, the local state legislatures need to establish a procedural law whereby the people_can initiate it. It has nothing to do with local legislators demanding something of D.C.As an alternative to a recall procedure against a Congressman, any member of congress can make a private unilateral employment contract with his constituents to pledge a certain conduct with penalties ( a court ordered enforcement of the terms of the breach of contract or fired from job )We the people can do it.

A firm, factual and a polite tone go a long way. It might be good idea to read Dana Milbank's article again. If ever there was a case of biased and sloppy reporting this would be it.Here is the link:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/20 ... After that take a Valium or meditate and wait a few minutes.The good people at Media Matters for America and FAIR-Fairness and Accuracy and Reporting have just put out some great information that specifically deals with the Washington Post:For Media Matters--see this link:http://mediamatters.org/items/200506170006#1 The FAIR info-package is at this link:http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2556 And this is my own personal letter to Mr. Michael Getler the Washington Post Ombudsman:E-mail: ombudsman@washpost.com Washington PostOmbudsmanMichael GetlerDear Mr. Getler:On June 8, Washington Post reporter Dana Milbank referred to media activists as "Wingnuts" for suggesting that the media has not properly held accountable the Bush Administration for possibly deceiving the American people. On June 17, 2005 Mr. Milbank mocked and ridiculed one of the U.S. House of Representatives most distinguished statesman for having the gall to challenge the White Houses line and the Republican Partys uncompromising control over the investigative responsibilities of Congress.Now let me say Mr. Getler that if this article was just one of many articles expressing a range of opinions, I would have little complaint. Is it not unseemly Mr. Getler that two of the very few pieces run by one of the worlds leading newspapers about a matter of such grave importance consist of insults, name-calling and personal nastiness? Do facts matter any more sir?Is it not disconcerting sir, that the whole question of whether or not the Bush Administration deceived the American Congress, media and people on an issue of such grave importance has received so very little attention in the Washington Post?Am I incorrect if I read between the lines that the general attitude of your newspaper is, Yah-ya--we know Bush lied. Thats not news. Well sir, I would suggest that perhaps it might be news to many, many people.I do hope that the Post will commit itself to a thorough, independent and in-depth investigation of its own on the whole question of the Bush Administrations possible manipulation of intelligence. If it is true Mr. Getler that the White House intentionally misled the nation--should not the Washington Post of all papers be leading the journalistic world in investigating this matter?Sincerely,__________________________________________________DU thread:Some Very Useful tools for writing WaPo's Ombudsman and othershttp://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.ph...

And we all know what that means. Tomlinson also tried to bury his own polling that was designed to show that the public felt their broadcasts were liberal. When the results showed that most people thought it was balanced, he tried to keep the results quiet.Raw Story has a good article (from NYT): Bush hand seen in public broadcastingE-mail messages obtained by investigators at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting show that its chairman, Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, extensively consulted a White House official shortly before she joined the corporation about creating an ombudsman's office to monitor the balance and objectivity of public television and radio program, the New York Times reports Saturday. Excerpts follow.#Mr. Tomlinson said in an interview three months ago that he did not think he had instructed a subordinate to send material on the ombudsman project to Mary C. Andrews at her White House office in her final days as director of global communications, a political appointment.But the e-mail messages show that a month before the interview, he directed Kathleen Cox, then president of the corporation, to send material to Ms. Andrews at her White House e-mail address. They show that Ms. Andrews worked on a variety of ombudsman issues before joining the corporation, while still on the White House payroll. And they show that the White House instructed the corporation on Ms. Andrews's job title in her new post.http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Bush_hand_seen_in_public_ ...

This post is in the wrong place, but with my newbie status I had to reply to a thread before initiating one. I think you'll agree this call to action is worth it.On the Tuesday the 29th  of November, GW is trying to sneak into Denver, unnoticed, to obtain funds from wealthy donors for Rep. Marilyn Musgrave. ProgressNowAction.org is funding a mobile billboard to follow the Bush folks around. There is a contest to come up with a picture and caption for this billboard.Denver is the town in which the Denver Three garnered a lot of media attention when they were unceremoniously thrown out of a taxpayer-financed Bush Social Security event by a man impersonating a secret service agent. With the help of the secret service themselves, the Bush administration was able to sweep the incident under the carpet. In a New York Times article dated 06/27/05, the same Marilyn Musgrave the reliable Bush ally that GW is now supporting, was quoted as saying, " they just want to get to the bottom of this, and I think that's fair."The billboard Ive done reads as follows:"They just want to get to the bottom of this, and I think that's fair." - Representative Marilyn Musgrave on Stonewalling the Denver ThreeLike an Elephant, Colorado Never Forgets.I am asking you to vote for this billboard. The billboard with the most votes wins. There is no prize for this contest and Im asking you to vote for the message, not the messenger. This is meant to get media publicity. The winning message should be pertinent. The caption on this billboard:1) Pits Musgraves words against Bushs policies2) Is relevant to the voters in Colorado3) Reinforces how easily things get covered up when were not vigilant4) Is topical as the Dems/Progressive/Liberals are now pressing Bush for answers5) Renews another agitating issue for this trainwreck of an administration to deal withThe URL to see all the billboards ishttp://www.progressnowaction.org /The URL to vote for the Musgrave & Denver Three VS George Bush ishttp://www.progressnowaction.org/modules/postcard/billb... and the URL for the Denver Three site is:http://www.denverthree.org The contest ends today, Wednesday, Nov 23 at noon. Sorry for the short notice. I just found out about this now. If you agree with the message tell your friends.Thanks for your consideration M.

ABC may profit from the predictable controversy but airing a film designed to obfuscate Bush's responsibility for 9/11 will cause ABC to suffer greatly in the estimation of serious people.Disney and ABC should leave the RNC propaganda to Fox, it's not ABC's demographic.Robert Iger - CEO - robert.a.iger@disney.com Rich Ross - President of Disney Channel Worldwide - rich.ross@disney.com Sean Cocchia - VP/Business Development, Disney Channel Worldwide- sean.cocchia@disney.com Gary Marsh - Disney Channel Worldwide President of Entertainment - gary.marsh@disney.com Sarah Shelton - Assistant to Gary Marshsarah - shelton@disney.com Scott Garner - SVP/Programming, Disney Channel - scott.garner@disney.com Karen Myer - Assistant to Scott Garner - karen.myer@disney.com Meredith Metz - Senior Vice President, Creative Affairs, Walt Disney Television Animation - meredith.metz@disney.com Lisa Salamone - The Head of Animation Production, Disney Channel - lisa.salamone@disney.com Joanna Spak - The Head of Finance, Planning, etc., Disney Channel - joanna.spak@disney.com Mark Kenchelian - The Head of Business and Legal Affairs, Disney Channel -mark.kenchelian@disney.com Jewell Engstrom - CFO and Executive VP for Disney-ABC Cable Group - jewell.engstrom@disney.com Olivia Stafford - Assistant to Jewell Engstrom - olivia.stafford@disney.com Albert Cheng - EVP/Digital Media, Disney-ABC Television Group - albert.cheng@disney.com Karen Hobson - Digital Media Communications Office, Disney-ABC Television Group - karen.hobson@disney.com George Bodenheimer - Co-Chairman Media Networks Group - george.bodenheimer@disney.com Nicole Nichols - Senior VP of Entertainment Communications, Disney-ABC Television Group - nicole.nichols@disney.com Aime Wolfe - Assistant to Nicole Nichols - aime.wolfe@disney.com Patti McTeague - VP of Kids Communications - patti.mcteague@disney.com Siobhan Kenny - Acting Head of International Communications - siobhan.kenny@disney.com Paul Lee - ABC Family Channel - paul.lee@disney.com Annie Fort - ABC Family Media Relations - annie.fort@disney.com Alex Wallau - President of Network Operations & Administration - alex.wallau@disney.com David Westin - ABC News President - david.westin@disney.com Mike Shaw - ABC Sales and Marketing President - mike.shaw@disney.com Fred Kuperberg - Disney/ABC Executive VP of Business and Legal Affairs - fred.kuperberg@disney.com Kara Rousseau - VP of Ad Sales Marketing for Disney/ABC Kids Networks - kara.rousseau@disney.com Kim Harbin - Buena Vista Media Relations - kim.harbin@disney.com Anne Gates - Disney Consumer Products Executive VP & CFO - anne.gates@disney.com James Fielding - Senior VP, Retail Sales and Marketing for DCP - james.fielding@disney.com Deborah Dugan - President of Disney Publishing - deborah.dugan@disney.com Graham Hopper - Senior VP and General Manager of Buena Vista Games - graham.hopper@disney.com Angela Emery - Director of Public Relations, Buena Vista Games - angela.emery@disney.com Chris Bess - Buena Vista Home Entertainment - chris.bess@disney.com Peter Murphy - Senior Adviser to Mr. Iger - peter.murphy@disney.com Judy Estrin - Board of Directors - jestrin@packetdesign.com John Bryson - Board of Directors - john.bryson@edisonintl.com Monica Lozano - Board of Directors - monica.lozano@laopinion.com John Chen - Board of Directors - john.chen@sybase.com Gary Wilson - Board of Directors - gary.wilson@nwa.com Leo Odonova - Board of Directors - leo.odonovan@mbna.com Thomas Staggs - CFO/Senior V.P. - tom.staggs@disney.com Mad as hell | 09.07.06 - 5:57 pm | # Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcalimary      (1000+ posts)      Fri Sep-08-06 12:53 AMResponse to Reply #169171.Part Sixty, First Add: On boycotting Disney/ABCEdited on Fri Sep-08-06 12:58 AM by calimaryFrom DUer bliss_eternal        Wed Sep-06-06 11:04 PMResponse to Original message 1.

To counteract the effects the ABC 9-11 movie could have on the midterm elections, I recommend this course of action:The night of, and the morning after, people will be hitting the internet looking for information on the events as depicted in this movie.Our biggest opportunity will be to have nearly identical blog posts waiting, then submit them to be found internet wide the morning after the movie. Google and Technorati will pick up on these posts quickly. We can make these entries dominate the first several pages of the search engines.MAKE SURE THE POST TITLE HAS THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE IN IT!Get every Democratic friendly blog on board as possible... you e-mail the ones you know, they'll e-mail the ones they know, etc. Make SURE these blogs are on the Technorati network and have also been submitted to Google's blog search.For one day, change the title of your blog to the title of the movie.Agree on a clear, detailed, and sourced body of information -- I've seen several examples on DU lately disputing what is in the movie. Media Matters has one. One was posted today on DU by Richard Clarke.Everyone post it. Right after the movie is over or the next morning at the latest.MAKE SURE THE POST TITLE HAS THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE IN IT!DU JOURNALS WILL ALSO WORK! They're indexed in Technorati!

My candidate, Eric Massa was naturally superior and the obvious choice for any sane American. he was not exaggerating though in his pleas for money and volunteers. We needed a small, better trained army for better shot and we didn't have them although we had a lot and it made a difference. The whole difference had not the desperate GOP retreated behind lies and trickery- for which they are paying a future cost in lost party members.  Cheney may have thought winning was the only thing, but the full idea is to win tomorrow today and keep winning the tomorrows.I would hate to see us return again to dependence and delegation of this citizen presence in democracy campaigning. I need to do more. I need to get others to join. I need to help get those situations conducive to participation. I need to enable those burdened by work, ill health or plain old timidity to get meaningfully involved. Our democracy has not overnight or though the activists returned to a state of full health. I wonder if we EVER had a healthy level of ground participation or anything to rival the boob tube and radio.Ironically, at work I was expediting the delivery of political mail- for all candidates. In a few minutes I moved along more circulars than a month of door to door lit dropping could contribute. Phone calling has a measured uphill effect. The ideas that I humbly pushed online may have had a wider, better effect. Talking to neighbors and voters one by one as a campaigner just as effective as the candidate is an overwhelming task against an entrenched incumbent with money. All that work and the GOP shooting itself constantly in the feet can be undone with a single oblique smear. Knowing, or even fearing, one will lose unmistakably guts the spirit and communicates itself rapidly even to the voters one wants to sway.This has been just an enlightening, brave and encouraging beginning. Thanks to Howard Dean and probably Dean alone, the grassroots can keep building and going forward to where true citizen volunteering will become a civic institution. Those of us now having little effects in the great scheme of American politics can and must become the future backbone. It is in in this that a democratic America will flourish- maybe for the first time in its brief history.

My difficulty in finding anyway to reach the left about what is happening is exactly how corporations are getting away with what could almost be considered a coup.  While we are watching the bailout and trying to put out blazes left by Bush and Cheney, they have used "progressives" to support "food safety" legislation designed by agribusiness and Monsanto and Big Pharma which people aren't  watching.  "Sure sure, we need food safety, about time, vote for it," is the attitude but the seven bills in congress amount to a take over of all the tangibles left of value in this country - the land, animals, seed, nutrients and control over us.  They are the total triumph of industrial ag and industrial med over normal food and natural health.  The game will be over.This was written to the sustainable ag community which is preparing to compromise on bills whose dark depths they have no idea of.  They know so little, they have actually been attacking activists trying to warn them.  But one could as well have written, "the stunning absence of the left while the country is taken over."  I would appreciate help in how to get this information out widely and what to categorize it under because if you put it under food and farming and rural, the politicos won't see it and yet this is a pre-911 moment with the totalitarian scope what these corporations are after and the left needs to see it.THE STUNNING NAIVETE OF THE SUSTAINABLE AG COMMUNITY.The sustainable ag community seems to have not noticed that everything they cares about is at stake with six "food safety" bills in congress, another one from Waxman on the way.They seem not to have noticed the timing - just after the inauguration, when hope was high and attention diverted by that and the bailout. They seem not to have noticed that the bills had to have been prepared well in advance of any peanut issues, suddenly showing up as they did.They seem not to have noticed that were it not for work by ordinary people to say the bills are dangerous, they may have already slipped through congress, unnoticed, as "food safety."They seem not to have noticed that they are Hillary Clinton's presidential platform to create a massive and centralized "food safety" department, a platform developed with her advisor Mark Penn, CEO of Burson Marsteller, representing Monsanto.They seem not to have noticed Hillary Clinton's ties going back to Arkansas and the Rose Law Firm - to Walmart, Tysons and Monsanto - world leaders in industrial food, industrial farming, biotech.  http://www.counterpunch.org/cole02082008.html They seem not to have noticed DeLauro's ties to agribusiness or her harshness in dealing with farmers.http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/4/12/719195/-The-blo...

They seem not to have noticed that Bill Clinton got us into the WTO with big promises US sovereignty would never be affected and Hillary bills - coming in through Rosa DeLauro and other Clinton friends - would eliminate US sovereignty over its own food supply, giving all power to the WTO.http://yupfarming.blogspot.com/2009/05/food-safety-bill...

They seem not to have noticed it's intentional.http://www.i-sis.org.uk/savePolishCountryside.php They seem not to have noticed the huge loss of diversity in seeds in the EU as only those placed on a government registry may be sold and since it costs a fortune to get seeds there, farmers can't and biotech can.They seem not to have noticed the FDA redefined seed as food and seed storage as one source of contamination or the implications.http://www.opednews.com/articles/FOOD-SAFETY-REGULATION... They seem not to have noticed the implications playing out already as the FDA has made normal seed cleaning equipment - central to sustainable agriculture - illegal and set the 'food safety" standard for the equipment so high it would cost a million or more to meet it, and separate equipment (and another million plus) is now required for each line of seed.They seem not to have noticed the "food safety" bills never mention the word "seed" and yet can eliminate ownership of them by simply doing to "storing" what they have already done to "sorting" - raise the standard above anyone's capacity to meet it.  http://www.opednews.com/articles/Seeds--How-to-criminal... They seem not to have noticed they need seed to exist and the country needs human control over them to remain a functioning democracy.http://www.organicconsumers.org/patent/iraq111704.cfm They seem not to have noticed that NAIS is in the bills and includes a version for plants as well, meaning all US farmland would be under it.They seem not to have noticed that NAIS includes Premises ID which is not "property" covered under the Constitution but an international term, that appears to make owners mere "stake holders" in their property.http://www.opednews.com/articles/NAIS--a-coerced-AND-hi... They seem not to have noticed the peculiarity of even a single chicken putting someone under NAIS and that their even getting rid of the chicken would not remove the land from "premises" registration, nor would selling the land to someone without animals.They seem not to have noticed this makes the argument that Premises ID is needed for tracing animal diseases, false.They seem not to have noticed the USDA for 5 years will not change the word to "property" or answer if it is so that landowners become mere "stake holders" or answer the accompanying question - "If those holding all US farmland are mere stake holders, who are they holding the stake for?"They seem not to have noticed that some believe that all US farmland, collected through this shift in a single word, may be collateral on the bailout and if we default, others - perhaps China - will claim it.http://www.newswithviews.com/brownfield/brownfield59.ht... They seem not to have noticed the bills are essentially Codex Alimentarius, http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-52668849124952... the primary political battlefield where the war is being waged about who will regulate and control the global food supply, from field and stable to table.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2D4-noTiCg They seem not to have noticed Codex is working with other groups supporting the following agendas: 1. The chemical industry's aim that all animals be treated with antibiotics and hormones. 2. The largest seed company in the world (Monsanto) is working toward 100% genetically-modified crops. 3. The nuclear industry's goal of irradiating all foods including plants and livestock. 4. All industries' goal: phasing out truly organic foods, or at least, making them extremely difficult to obtain. They seem not to have noticed that under Codex, all nutrients (vitamins and minerals) are to be considered toxins/poisons and are to be removed from all food because Codex prohibits the use of nutrients to "prevent, treat or cure any condition or disease"They seem not to have noticed that all food (including organic) is to be irradiated, removing all toxic nutrients from food (unless eaten locally and raw).They seem not to have noticed that nutrients allowed will be limited to a Positive List developed by Codex which will include such beneficial nutrients like Fluoride (3.8 mg daily) developed from environmental waste. All other nutrients will be prohibited nationally and internationally to all Codex-compliant countries .They seem not to have noticed that all nutrients (e.g., CoQ10, Vitamins A, B, C, D, Zinc and Magnesium) that have any positive health impact on the body will be deemed illegal under Codex and are to be reduced to amounts negligible to humans' health .They seem not to have noticed that people will not even be able to obtain these anywhere in the world even with a prescription.They seem not to have noticed that all advice on nutrition (including written online or journal articles or oral advice to a friend, family member or anyone) will be illegal, including reports on vitamins and minerals and all nutritionist's consultations.They seem not to have noticed the bills contain a civil and criminal penalty section that sets up an independent funding source so there will be no congressional oversight, has unlimited punishments even beyond the massive ones listed, will be applied by "the Administrator" (see below) without judicial review over even validity and appropriateness.http://yupfarming.blogspot.com/2009/04/food-safety-as-t...

They seem not to have noticed that those promoting the bills use canny verbiage to deny they will regulate or shut down organic farming, gardening, farmers markets, etc.  by saying "there is no language in the bill" that says those things, while those opposing the bills flag the worrisome fact of broad and vague language and then point instead to what the bills will actually do.They seem not to have noticed that, though so much is at stake, the organizations they count on are quoting reassurances from the very people who introduced the bills, despite their close ties to agribusiness and Monsanto.They seem not to have noticed that the organizations they count on plan to compromise with the bills, trusting industry's friends' reassurances while dismissing the long list of threats which farming/health/food/leftist friends have easily seen in them.They seem not to have noticed the oddness of that or flinched at Monsanto bragging in comments on websites that Grist and Slow Food agree with them there is no problem.http://www.opednews.com/articles/The-2009-Food-Safety-B... They seem not to have noticed in reassuring them nothing is wrong, their own organizations are aligned with Monsanto interests.They seem not to have noticed that Monsanto has repeatedly shown up on websites, trashing those criticizing them, while saying they are not involved with the bills at all.They seem not to have noticed that Bill Clinton gave us Michael Taylor and Taylor gave us rBGH and unlabeled, unregulated GMOs.They seem not to have noticed Taylor is back, dressed as a "food safety" professor now, and was on Obama's transition team.  They seem not to have noticed that Food Democracy Now says Monsanto, through Michael Taylor, is expecting to run the giant agency the bills will set up and to control the entire US food supply, including all farms and homes and gardens.They seem not to have noticed that Codex was developed by Nazis.They seem not to have noticed the bills are Kissinger Plan of "control food, control people."They seem not to have noticed these bills are a more extreme threat to our country, our democracy, and each of us individually than the bailout.They seem not to have noticed they should be mobilizing for all they are worth.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Sat Nov-07-09 05:30 AMResponse to Original message199.Deleted messageMessage removed by moderator.

An Obama "assassination" as a math lessonEdited on Tue May-18-10 02:18 PM by calimaryAlabama teacher who used the example of an Obama assassination to teach a math class about angles (the angle you'd need to shoot him if he was over here). Secret Service did investigate and talk to him and determined there was no reason to hold him, and school officials see no reason to fire him. Don't know about you, but I certainly DO!From mod mom: Here is the school board contact info for those who'd like to join me in expressing outrage at the handling of this:School board is at Jefferson County Board of Education.Here is their official website: http://www.jefcoed.com/Pages/Default.aspx Address: 2100 18th Street South Birmingham, AL 35209Phone: 205-379-2000Please call and ask for the Superintendent's office, to register a complaint.
