December saw Richard Michael Daley, the Mayor of Chicago, surpass the term of tenure that his old man Richard Joseph Daley also held forbeing Mayor. Richard Daley was Mayor from 1955 through to the day of his death in 1976. An astonishing reign.Richard Michael Daley has managed to pass that twenty one year stint on December 26th meaning that father and son ruled (and still rule) Chicago for 42 of the last 55 years.The Daley family have had Chicago in a political lockdown for generations. They are a small example of local oligarchies in action.The old boy was accused of being an old fashioned operator, mobilising armies of Union members to force through his point of view. A Democrat National Convention member in 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964 Daley made sure that the party and its leaders reflected the Daley view of America..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesMayors of Chicago, President Obama, Richard Joeseph Daley, Richard Michael Daley, The Daley Family of Chicago, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101, US Secretary of State, White House and Wall Street, William DaleyRead moreBirthers, Obama, Astrology and RumpelstiltskinThe Oligarch Kings.January 4, 2011jamesb1014 commentsThere is a long running, low level controversy which has been picking up a bit of heat in the quiet news-free days around Christmas. Started way back in June 2009 by Mike Castle a Republican congressman from Delaware, it is the idea that Obama will not release his full birth certificate because he was not born in Hawaii as he says but somewhere else outside the United States. The usual suspects being Kenya or the Philippines. As such he would not be eligible for the office of President because of Section 1 of Article 2 of the Constitution. Remember the fuss over poor old Chester Arthur? If he cant prove he is born in the USA, say these people, he must stand down which would leave everyone stuck with Joe (who? I thought he was dead) Biden. Not a happy thought.Those who persist in demanding Obamas long certificate as opposed to the abbreviated one being offered, are termed Birthers, and sadly their numbers grow the greater as Obama digs in and refuses to release the long certificate.More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesAstrology and Rumpelstiltskin, Birthers, Obama, Obama's Birth certificate, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101Read moreNew Map Of American English.The Oligarch Kings..December 30, 2010jamesb101No commentsI love new maps that show the world in fresh and unexpected lights, and this by Rich Aschmann on the linguistic dialects of English as she is spoken in the United States and Canada is a rare treat.You can find the site athttp://aschmann.net/AmEng/More @ The Oligarch KingsShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Other Things, UpdatesEnglish Language Map, Rich Aschmann/Maps, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101Read moreUN Maps Show Afghan War Is Being Lost.The Oligarch Kings.December 29, 2010jamesb101No commentsThe two maps featured here are from the United Nations and show the provinces of Afghanistan and the level of threat each represents. The first map is from the earlysummer and second more recently in October. They starkly reveal that the Afghanistan War is being lost though Obama happily assured the American public earlier this month that  the strategy is on track and that troops would start coming home next July, and whilst his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was piping up telling anyone who would listen that We are being clear eyed and realistic [in assessing that the allies are on top of the problem] .There is no suggestion that matters have improved in the last three months.Several parts of Afghanistan previously considered safe and secure have now been upgraded to High Risk. These are: Baghis; Sanagan; Faryab; Laghman and Takhar. They show that the south of the country where the US is making the fiercest push remains stubbornly high risk.The documents which were classed as classified were published by The Wall Street Journal, and republished by The Daily Mail, so I am not expecting their editors to be wheeched off to the dungeons of the State to be charged with treason anytime soon, unlike Assange..More @ The Oligarch Kings.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Media, Military, Politics, UpdatesMaps on the Afghan threat analysis, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101, The US/NATO Afghan War, United Nations supplied mapsRead moreMunroes Doctrine, Fiske, and Palins Corollary.The Oligarch KingsDecember 16, 2010jamesb1013 commentsJohn Fiske1842-1901I had flippantly suggested on December 7th in Death to Assange  An all American Fatwa that Sarah Palins proposing that Australian (and by extension all foreign) citizens who deal in, or publish American secrets should become subject to American treason charges might be either her stupidity, or an astonishing hubris  a gross extension of Monroes doctrine. I might have left that thought there, if it wasnt for the huge number of others whose opinions in comment pages of news sites all across the web echo exactly that same sentiment.Munroes doctrine was first espoused in 1823. It is not something that emerged with the triumph of the States after the Second World War. Munroe, an oligarch President aided by fellow oligarch Adams fluid pen, simply put into final prose the notion that the western hemisphere was the business purely of the United States and that other powers-principally Britain, France, and Spain  should butt out and leave alone. It was a refinement of what had oft been thought before put elegantly into words. It has since been refined and expanded by successive, again mostly oligarchic, Presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, John F Kennedy and Ronnie Reagan.Initially no one paid any attention or treated it as other than the hyperbole of an upstart newcomer, both comic and risible. It was though then, as it is now, a simple declaration of hegemony, empire and Americas right of unilateral intervention.The latest comments point at a new, undisguised move, to that of an openly declared world hegemony. It looks novel, but surprisingly perhaps to outside viewers, it was always thus and has been an essential to the American experiment from the off..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Men, Politics, Updates, Womenand Palins Corollary....The Oligarch Kings..., Blogs, Calvin Coolidge, Fiske, Herbert Hoover, John F Kennedy and Ronnie Reagan., Munroes Doctrine, Presidents, Sarah Palin, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101, Theodore Roosevelt, Death to Assange  An all American FatwaRead moreDeath To Assange  An All American FatwaThe Oligarch KingsDecember 8, 2010jamesb101No commentsIll shoot him myself.Well, its turned nastier faster than I had expected. Last week we were all settling back, reading the papers and enjoying the gentle humiliation of the United States Diplomatic Service with their pointed jibes, and sour innuendo about this leader of the world or that. I for one enjoyed the wit, barb and undoubted literary style of some of the diplomats cables.An embarrassment certainly, but really little more if we are being truthful.But today, the anniversary if anyone was noticing of the murder of Cicero, the maskslipped, and a different America is showing, her face darker and more deadly than we have seen for many years.Two definite candidates for the next Presidential race have thought we needed their input on the affair, and the result is less than pretty.Sarah Palin has seen Assanges act as treasonous and called on the state to use all necessary means to hunt him down like an Al-Qaeda terrorist. Leaving aside the obvious gaff that Assange is an Australian citizen who therefore cannot be tried for treason against the United States of America, (unless this is a monstrous Palin-esq extension of the Munro Doctrine) it is simply plainly incitement to murder. It sounds no different to a Mullahs calling for a Fatwa against the unbeliever.Worse, she is not alone in such calls. Mike Huckabee has called for the arrest and execution of those who leaked the documents to WikiLeaks in the first place.Not to be left out Glenn Beck has made the same mistake as Palin in calling for Assange to be charged with Treason and executed.Whilst Assange is yet to be charged with any crime relating to Cablegate, will US prosecutors take action against these monstrous public incitements for murder?Dont hold your breath.Most egregious of all was Professor Tom Flanagan of the University of Calgary, and a senior advisor to Canadas Prime Minister, who on a CBC interview suggested outright that Obama should assassinate Assange. Afterwards, when given the opportunity to retract these outbursts he went further saying I wouldnt feel unhappy if Assange should disappear.Noam Chomsky remarked earlier this week that Perhaps the most dramatic revelation [of the leaked cables] is the bitter hatred of democracy that is revealed by both the US Govt  Hillary Clinton [and] others- and also by the diplomatic service.

The first was a piece in politicaldog101 on November 29th that the United States Defence Budget had risen 119% since 2001 and now stood at $700 billion. Thats a year. Every year. The budget now is the same as all defence spending by all other countries on the globe put together. It is an almost incomprehensible amount of moneyAstonishing as this is, it raised some questions. The first being what on earth do they spend this on, and how come it costs so much? The next being if the United States spends so much money on defence why does she not win any of her wars? And are they connected?The other item went, I think, some ways to answering these questions.The picture above is of the snappily named XM-25, or to give it its full Sunday name a Counter Defilade Target Engagement System. Defilade is a French term for something you hide behind when being shot at. So this gun is used to strike at enemies behind cover.It has a laser target acquisition system that calculates the distance between you and the target, which can be the equivalent of nine football fields away. Its more a spec-ed up grenade launcher than a rifle but is being punted as such by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) who manufacture this little baby for the US Government. It comes complete with sophisticated computer guidance and laser aiming, specialized ammo, batteries and other components.Its weight, considering western soldiers now wear body armour routinely, makes it a bit heavy and the cartridges are not light either. As any distance over say 200 meters is not relevant to your average soldier this is really a bit of kit for the specialised sniper or special forces boys. Not that this is stopping the manufacturers from supplying one to every squad. Thats, oh, say 12,500 of the things.And the cost?A mere $25,000.00 a pop. The cartridges are $24 each. You do the math. Scary eh?So that helps answer the question of how the money gets spent. Never mind that it would help if you can actually see well enough to tell the difference between your allies, the enemy and locals celebrating a wedding at that kind of distance- the guys at ATK say this gun is going to bethe game changer in Afghanistan.AK-47The picture above is of its rival in the battlefields of Afghanistan, and indeed everywhere else. It is of course the universal, the ubiquitous, the AK47, or one of its children. Invented by Avtormat Kalashnikov a 29 year old Russian tank commander in 1947. Today it is used by radical armies, national armies, drug gangs and guerrillas. And the ex-mujahidin or Taliban in Afghanistan. Of all the arms in the whole world one in five is a AK47More @ The Oligarch Kings.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Military, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesBlogs, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101, The XM-25 And The AK-47, US Government spendingRead moreCan You Keep A Secret?.The Oligarch Kings..November 29, 2010jamesb1015 commentsPicture DiceccaIt snowed heavily last night, and the buses were off this morning, so I walked into work. But despite this I doubt it was anywhere near as frosty as American diplomats must be finding foreign corridors of power this morning. The leaked documents are everywhere you look. There is no escape from any of the printed media or the TV. They are even featuring in the free newspapers given away on trains. So much for DA notices then! But then that was outlined in my previous post.And as forecast there is little here of the James Bond stuff. No revealing of secret missile codes, no target parameters, no disclosure of the wiring diagrams of laser guided death stars. No list of agents behind curtains whose imminent deaths can be expected on the back of this vile disclosure. And why should it, as the release is not of Top-Secret documents but rather of daily traffic in diplomatic circles, comments, grumbles and thoughts, designed so we are told, solely to promote debate and understanding. Well, if that is so they have surely succeeded beyond all expectations.In fact so hard are people trying to upload the stuff its quite hard to find it all in one place. Here are simply a few of my favourites.Angela Merkel of Germany avoids risks and is rarely creative. Sounds like a woman being judged as unimaginative in her flower arrangements for the local church.Mr Sarkozy of France is both thin skinned and has an authoritarian style and is an emperor with no clothes. Thats not original. C- for creative writing there.David Cameron of Britain is called lightweight and lacking depth. This, was, it seems from the Governor of the Bank of England. Hmm. Well he will be off the Christmas card list then.Silvio Berlusconi of Italy is feckless, vain and ineffective as a modern European leader whose frequent late nights and penchant for partying hard mean he does not get sufficient rest. Wonderful! Who got the job of wising up old Berls ahead of that one coming out?And in a typically overblown and flamboyantly Italian way the Foreign Minister, Franco Fratti stated it is the September 11 of world diplomacy. Nice to see they are taking it calmly then.In fact they show that the US is far, far ruder about her allies than she ever is about her rivals. Vladimer Putin is described as an Alpha Dog who plays Batman to Medvedevs Robin. Great stuff, I am sure he will have that as a plaque on the wall of his office by the end of the week, just as Maggie Thatcher took the Russian jibe of being the Iron Lady as a compliment . Putin will revel in being called Batman.Gadaffi is just described as erratic. Well that diplomat isnt worth his salary is he?The US dont like the way the British ran their operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. But thats hardly news. US and British generals loathed each other in the Second World War too.Interestingly this fiasco has knocked the administration surprisingly off beam..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Men, Military, Politics, Updates, WomenBlogs, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101, The Wikileaks Caper, World reaction to the Wikileaks CaperRead moreWikileakss Chickens Come Home To RoostThe Oligarch Kings.November 28, 2010jamesb1012 commentsFrom WikileaksThe hype over the release of these notes and cables by Wikileaks from American Diplomatic sources has almost equalled that for Harry Potter. Its going to be a publishing sensation, right up there with the Pentagon Papers.The UK government  ever ready to do the USs bidding  has issued D notices to the press. Always a good sign, a D notice.A D notice  nowadays more properly a DA or Defence Advisory Notice is no longer compulsory  they lost that game years ago  and is of five types. The only two I am aware that have been utilised, are Type 1 for Military Operation plans, and Type 5 relating to United Kingdom Security and Intelligence Special Service. Certainly sounds scary eh?They have been issued to all the usual national and provincial papers which is normal, and now to at least one blog. Order Order, a site run by Guido Fawkes claims they too have been served. The Oligarchkings has not been issued with a D notice and I am slightly disappointed.It will do no good whatsoever. Anyone remember Spycatcher?The idea is that newspapers, and one assumes web sources, will voluntarily keep shtum for Queen and Country until the cover is blown elsewhere and material is considered to be in the public domain. So that should last about ten minutes then.So what might we expect from this treasure trove of diplomatic indiscretion?P J Crowley, the US State Department spokesman states that These revelations are harmful to the US and our interests and It will place lives and interests at risk. It is irresponsible. Now you just know its going to be good when they wheel that old conker out.But what might be there? Well, we have a clue in that US State Department officials were in a panic all through Friday contacting their opposite numbers across the globe. It points to the failure of how America manages its relationships with its alliesMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Media, Military, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesA 'D' notice, Blogs, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101, The UK, US Government explinations, Wikileaks dumpRead moreFatalism And Free Cheese.The Oligarch Kings.November 17, 2010jamesb101No commentsEven as we watch the financial world we once knew collapse around us the surreal, the bizarre and the downright weird give us hope for humanity.Only in Ireland could the imminent collapse of the entire financial structure be met with as odd a solution as this.For the Government there is going to raise the mood of the nation by a dole of  free cheese.

I paraphrase but slightly, when I say they said If you are on the breadline the last thing you want is cheese.
