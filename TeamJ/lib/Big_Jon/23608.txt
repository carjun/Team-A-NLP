For over two decades, Oswalt has earned his place as one of the funniest and most respected stand-up comics in America. After raising his profile after going on tour as "The Comedians of Comedy" in 2004 with his cohorts Zach Galifianakis, Maria Bamford and Brian Posehn, Oswalt's highly intelligent, culture-packed barbs have effectively transformed him from an underground hero into a crowd-pleasing icon. In addition to his stand-up work, Oswalt has turned in some impressive roles as an actor ("Big Fan," "Ratatouille," "The Informant!"), and this week released his first book, a memoir entitled "Zombie Spaceship Wasteland" (Scribner, $24). Taking time out from promoting his book, Patton was kind enough to speak with us in the basement of a Borders about Sarah Palin's future, his disappointment with President Obama, and the real reason behind the unexplainable crop of dead animals.Patton Oswalt is appearing at Caroline's in Times Square tonight at 8:00 and 10:30 p.m.WATCH:        Get HuffPost Comedy On        Twitter and Facebook!

Guys like Patton are really writers who study human nature. He does that for a living, in fact, as it provides a lot of grist for his material. He probably even has people who help him conduct and assimilate relevant research.
