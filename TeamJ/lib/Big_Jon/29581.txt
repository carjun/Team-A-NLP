Nonethelessprior to revealing some reasons why one might be gaining weight; lets take alook at 5 things you must be doing in order to lose weight. Under normal circumstances everyone should be able to loseweight with the right balance of calorie intake and exercise. If you are eatinga healthy diet and exercising then theoretically one should be maintaining anormal weight and or losing weight with a decrease of caloric intake.

Thesize of a deck of cards equates to a 3 ounce portion of meat or a  cup portionof carbohydrates.   Portion sizes areimportant if you are eating just an extra 200 calories a day then that adds upto 1400 calories a week. Eat Breakfast everyMorning  Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  If you do not eat after fasting for more than8 to 10 hours after your evening meal then the metabolism will begin to slowdown dramatically in order to preserve itself. Break this fast by eating a wholesome breakfast in the morning ratherthan waiting and eating a huge lunch. Do Not Drink HighCalorie Coffee Drinks - Here lies hidden calories that some individuals maynot realize how these delicious drinks are adding calories.  For example a grande mocha latte with nonfatmilk and no whipped cream still contains about 290 calories; so choose what youput in your coffee wisely. Avoid Food Cravings that Can Result in a Calorie Creep - Just aseating breakfast is important so is consumption of the right types offoods.  At breakfast ones metabolism isin starvation mode, if the foods eaten at this time consist of only simplesugars or fast converting carbohydrates; then you will get a quick spike inyour energy level.  However, by lunch youwill be starving and wanting to eat way more than you should; thereforebreakfast should consist of high fiber and protein. Calories Burned during Workouts Correctly - Exercise with a reducedcalorie diet should equal weight loss. Exercising six to seven days with workouts in the target heart rate zonefor 30 to 45 minutes will cause one to lose weight. Adhering to all of theabove steps should put one on the road to weight loss success.  However, if you are truly abiding by the rulesoutlined above and you still find that you healthy weight loss program was unsuccessfulthen lets take it a step further.   Asstated earlier there are medical reasons that can cause you to gain weight andor not be able to lose weight.  Possible Medical IssuesPossible medical issuesmight be hindering your weight loss plan. Lets first take a look at somemedical reasons your healthy weight loss program was unsuccessful. The first two of these medical reasons wererevealed in the quiz segment of Dr. Ozs show and was titled, The SecretReasons You Cant Lose a Pound.  Click thumbnail to view full-sizeIslets of Langerhans  Islets of Langerhans - WrongDiagnosis.comPancreas Functions - Hormones - Islets of LangerhansCushings SyndromeIsletsof Langerhans  are clusters of cells located in the pancreas thatmakes about 1 to 2 percent of the mass of the pancreas.  These cells are divided into two types, betacells and alpha cells that release hormones insulin in the blood stream that isneeded to metabolize glucose and regulates blood sugar.   Whenglucose levels in the bloodstream rise after eating the pancreatic beta cellssecret insulin; problems with these beta cells can cause you to gain weight.  Zona Fasciculata  are constituent cells organized into bundlesor fascicles that located in the middle part of the adrenal cortex that isdirectly under the zona glomerulosa.  Thezona fasciculate produces cortisol (glucocorticoids) which regulates themetabolism of glucose during times of stress. Cushing's syndrome is one condition that results when the adrenalglands (located on top of each kidney) produce an excess amount of a steroidhormone called cortisol. This leads to a build-up of fat in characteristicsites such as the face, upper back, and abdomen.  And one of the symptoms to this hormonaldisorder is weight gain.  Click thumbnail to view full-sizeThyroidThyroid (Hypothyroidism) - This is a condition where the thyroidgland, located in the neck, produces too little thyroid hormone. The thyroid hormoneregulates our metabolism; so too little hormone slows the metabolism and oftencauses weight gain. Your physician should perform blood tests to check yourhormone levels in order to rule out the thyroid as a possible reason for weightgain.AdaptiveThermogenesis  deals with the regulation of the production ofheat in response to environmental changes in temperature and diet which canresult in a metabolic inefficiency and can be the cause of unsuccessful weightloss as well. I have a friend that wastold by a weight loss doctor that her adaptive thermogenesis was set so highthat she could probably survive a long time on just water alone. Needless to say, weight loss is always astruggle for her because she and her doctor is consistently looking for ways totrick her body to lose weight. Too badthis problem went undiscovered for years while she consistently participated inyo-yo dieting and failure.

Tips on dealing with it -by Soni2006Perimenopause weight gain  causes and solutionsFOXNews.com - The Male Biological ClockEnding NoteAs you can see there are numerous reasons of why a healthyweight loss program was unsuccessful for you.  My research revealed that sleeping disorders,unusual amounts of stress, certain medications, and even stomach tumors can be culprits that arepreventing one from losing weight. The intent of this hub is not to give anindividual reasons or excuses NOT to continue to strive to lose weight. The purpose ofthis hub is to provide hope and information to those that truly desire to loseweight but have been unsuccessful in their own attempts.   Numerouspeople simply give up the fight and start eating more, which creates more badfeelings, and thoughts of one fighting a losing battle with weight.  Then it becomes a vicious cycle of overeating because of depression and gaining more weight begins and vice versa. Again if you can truly say that you have been followingthe 5 step rules above to lose weight for a reasonable amount of time andinstead you continue to gain weight and or unable to lose weight then it mightbe time to consult a physician.  Inaddition, I think it is important to do as Oprah and Dr. Oz always advises, andthat is if you consult your regular doctor and he or she feels nothing is wrongwith you.  It will not hurt to seek asecond and maybe even a third opinion. It is unfortunate that some doctors are not as well informed as othersand sometimes can miss problems that maybe existing in ones body.   But, persistenceis the key to success. This is the conclusion of the hub Healthy WeightLoss was Unsuccessful and I sincerely hope that if you are struggling withlosing weight that you will seek professional help to assist you in your quest.  Dont give up the fight to regain the healthyweight you would like to attain.  Asalways feel free to leave comments below!Disclaimer: This information is solely for informationalpurposes.

You are right that the key to successful weight loss is proper diet and exercise. However if one is doing this properly and still not losing weight then it is time to seek help to see if there is something happening within one's body to prevent one from being successful. :)sammiefields25129 months ago Good article, thanks. There ARE a number of different conditions that can make it difficult for one to lose weight, hypothyroidism for example and the others that you mentioned. However none of them are an excuse for being fat! If you have sufficient caloric restriction, there's nothing to stop you from losing weight. You just have to restrict those calories in the right way for your appetite stimulants to adjust in a way that you can maintain it.Money Glitch9 months ago Hhhhmmm, I kinda think you missed the point of the hub,(that sometimes there are medical reasons why normal diet and exercise stopping working for an individual) however everyone has a right to their own opinion. Thanks for stopping by and sharing your thoughts and stopping by for a read.geoffco236 months ago Hi. Thorough and entertaining hub. I would add that getting your head right can make a big difference to whether or not you succeed in getting fit and healthy. Friends and family can be the biggest obstacles to healthy weight loss, either through well-intentioned sabotage - 'Surely one won't hurt you?' - or social pressure, with fear of change at the root of it. Win the battle in your head and you're halfway there.Money Glitch6 months ago Thanks for stopping by and sharing your thoughts on healthy weight loss program was unsuccessful.  I agree that family and friends can sabotage one's weight loss program if you allow them too. And that the once you conquer the battle in your head you are halfway there. :)Healthy Living wtih Authentic Woman6 months ago Those '5 Steps that Assist in Weight Loss' you have above are definitely on track. Although, I have to add...a few of us have way too much "unprocess" emotion lingering that prevents us to truly feel the "fullness" when we are done eating & is probably holding onto those stubborn weights. Besides that, I totally see the validity in the toxins playing a role on not being able to shed those extra fat weights.... And I think it's safe to put the question out there for ourselves before we jump to the conclusion that our healthy weight loss program is unsuccessful . Honestly, are you really doing ALL the steps CONSISTENTLY? For me, I notice I gained weight easily back if I'm off track...Money Glitch6 months ago I agree, however, there are people that are very faithful to diets and still cannot lose weight if there are underlying illnesses or problems that I mentioned above.  Thanks for stopping by and sharing your thoughts. :)Diet follower Sam2 months ago Very informative and well illustrated Hub.
