I sure miss OB and it is nice to know its just a plane ride away to go back in time for me. love you, Donna________________________________________________________________Gary Ghirardi / Nov 3rd, 2008 at 6:57 amAnother RAG in the tradition of the OBRag from Austin that dates back to the mid sixties, has gone on line after many years with an online blog:http://theragblog.blogspot.com/and is archiving its old stuff online also:http://www.nuevoanden.com/rag/There should be a network of these spaces to encourage their survival and renewal nationally.  ML________________________________________________________________Judi Curry // Oct 13, 2008I only stumbled onto your newsletter when a friend sent me an email re: the Octoberfest and there was a great picture of her and her husband in your picture section. Finally  someplace to go and read the views of people that think in the same vein as I do. I am going to spread the word  not just in OB but all over. It is wonderful to know that others feel the same way!________________________________________________________________Tanja  WInter // Aug 12, 2008 OB Rag is really impressive. My resistance to being swallowed up by my computer has kept me from spending more time on internet reading. I appreciate your articles.Ive been searching and demanding coverage of US involvement in Georgia-Russia confrontation. Hardly a peep out of anyone._____________________________________________________________Anon92107 // Jul 11, 2008 Letter sent to Congresswoman Susan Davis:Susan, this quote from Lee Iacocca applies to you: We didnt elect you to sit on your asses and do nothing and remain silent while our democracy is being hijacked and our greatness is being replaced with mediocrity.Susan, you had one of the best opportunities in American history to make the right things happen to protect the future for our children and grandchildren, and you failed completely.Worst of all, you failed the tests of Democracy along with the leaderless congress, a judiciary that has overthrown the Rule of Law, and you let our education system crash and burn.The biggest question today is can American Democracy survive your failures?________________________________________________________________Tito Zevallos // Jul 9, 2008 Hey guys,OBRag.org has received a mention in the Ocean Beach section of the San Diego Readers community blogs. It was posted by WT_Effman, another OBecian who believes in your mission. You may want to check it out at this URL:http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/obeetuary/2008/jul/09/the-spirit-of-ob/Thanks for all that you do in the name of peace, justice and OB.________________________________________________________________Citizens For A Better Veterans Home (founded 1998) // Jul 4, 2008Mikey Weinstein, who has had his windows shot at and feces thrown in his yard, found a swastika on the front of his house over the weekend. Its a horrible feeling of humiliation, embarrassment and rage, Weinstein said. This one cuts the deepest. Whether you are Jewish or Christian, you dont want a swastika on your house.Weinstein, a Jewish attorney and former counsel to President Ronald Reagan, made headlines in 2005 when he filed suit against the Air Force, claiming it imposed evangelical Christianity on academy cadets in violation of their constitutional rights. The suit was dismissed because the plaintiffs were no longer cadets. A group founded by Weinstein, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, filed a new suit in March that claimed the entire military is violating the religious liberties of servicemen and women. Weinstein and his two sons are graduates of the Air Force Academy. Weinstein was alerted to the swastika after two of his German shepherds started barking Saturday. He said he saw a dark car backing out of his driveway and found the swastika and a cross on the stucco next to his front door. The symbols were the size of a kitchen plate and looked like they had been written with magic marker.These people are cowards, said Weinstein, whose story has been publicized on national talk shows and in newspapers across the country. It is also featured in a recently released documentary, Constantines Sword, by Oscar-nominated documentarian Oren Jacoby. The films Web site says it focuses on Christian anti-semitism as the model for all religious hatred, exposing the cross as a symbol of a long history of violence against Jews. The film is to open in Albuquerque on July 18.Weinstein said he and his family started noticing unusual behavior at their home on Thursday.They saw a car pulling out of their driveway one evening. Someone had turned off the fountain to their pond, killing one of their fish.Sheriffs officials said they plan to notify the New Mexico Gang and Terrorism Task Force and do periodic checks at Weinsteins home.The swastika escalates things in my mind, said Rabbi Arthur Flicker of Congregation Bnai Israel. It symbolizes horrific racism and violence that our fathers and grandfathers fought to destroy.________________________________________________________________ Tito Zevallos // Jul 3, 2008 at 6:18 pm Ive got an idea that should please everybody. Since we have beaches that are designated for special purposes, such as exercising dogs, why cant we have a specific beach area that allows regulated consumption of alcohol? Regulations would include the usual and obvious, such as a ban on glass containers, and could contain other regulations to prevent abuse, such as not allowing anything larger than a quarter keg on the beach. This is pretty much how the smoking issue is handled and it seems to work well.In Ocean Beach, I would suggest that the area on the south side of the pier and going north to the lifeguard station would be perfect. The area in front of that beach is a surfing-only area, so swimming under the influence would be discouraged. The area north of this allows swimming and body boarding, which families would be more inclined to enjoy.By the way, Im 49 years old, self-employed, and its MY BEACH too. I dont see why I have to deprive myself of any rights to indulge the narrow-minded prejudices of others. Treating bad behavior by a minority of people with a full ban for everyone is tantamount to treating dandruff by decapitation.________________________________________________________________Tito Zevallos // Jul 2, 2008Hey Guys,Nice blog! Glad to see the spirit of the OBRag and OBGO is still alive and kicking!From the Good News  Finally! department, it appears Starbucks is reeling from a bad economy and is planning to shut down 600 stores.*I bet the store in OB is one of them. Cant wait to see a mom-and-pop Fair Trade Coffee shop replace their corporate rumps.Finally!*http://dailybriefing.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/07/01/starbucks-has-a-bitter-plan/-Doug Porter  June 20, 2008wow! what a flashback.as a former member of the red zoomie collective who contributed to some of the OB Peoples Rag editions (I actually sold the Liberator for spare change), its really great to see that the progressive spirit is alive and kicking in OB.I remember when Frank was underground, we faced daily harassment for our politics, and the times were so heady that we often debated whether or not it was worth it to pay the phone bill because the phone company would be amongst the first to go come the revolution.I have recently relocated back to the San Diego area after 30+ years of being away. I look forward to becoming re-involved with the local scene as i ease myself back into life here.Doug Porter.________________________________________________________________max black crow // May 21, 2008 at 12:57 pmI worked with the liberator in the late sixties and I wrote you what I was doing now. Back then we had socialist views. We always questioned the puritan colonialist values of this country. We fought for the right to speak when not spoken too, and always question authority ! I see the paper has changed and wonder why get caught up in the polictical machine. This country is broken, you all will never own homes or even get close to the so called american dream.This was a Liberal paper? is it still? The issues are the working class issues, the struggle with corporate America. The fucking capitalist greed machine whom I had to work for and theyve gained great profits off our blood and sweat. Im 57 years old, Ive never gave in to their ways. I ve seen my co- workers killed and mamed at work. Then we recieve a mire fraction of the moneies from these companies. You need to get the word out that the working class is the backbone of America. If a corporations exceutives miss work for a month the coporation lives on, BUT! if we the workers stop for a week that corporation will die! The loss of income would cripple that company.We the people have power. We need to stick together and pull ourselves out of this corporate hole theyve put us in. Health care, and fuel should be taken out of the stock market. To make millions on health care stock is insane! making money of of peoples suffering is a sick nation. To make movie stars and sports figures our heros and pay them millions for entertainment is a travisty!If the world went to war and the country destroyed, the working class will be heros and the sports and movie star will have to count on us to get the nation up and running! What the fuck has happened to our youth. Dont get caught up in the politics , get to some real issues. no reason we can come to an agreement with companies to share the wealth. How many millions does it take for a family to live the American dream. I work hard and only welcome death to end my pain. I die owing people and have made pipelines for oil companies made shipsto move comodities. Then die poor and broken. I dont get it? make me understand why you young thinkers cant see or deal with some real issues? the Liberator did! We fought to be heard. I ended up killing for the united states of America in their Marine corp.I believe in the United states as a people. I believe in you all. Find the real underlined issues like making the paying feild equal. No reason we all cant retire and be able to live a good life. Its peoples values and jealousy and greed that drives this Fucked up nation. Expose it ! write and fight about it. My father died without seeing the great things in this world. Working hard in the local ship yards making just barely enough. No reason this great nation should let that happen to any one parents. The greed in this countey is pheonaminal. We let it go on.You young people can change this nation, just do it. Find a way to spread the money out in a way that we can all be happy. There so much I have learned and have seen. To much to write about. I grew up in S.D like I said before , my family has been there scince 1896.Ive seen this place change so much that I actually moved because of it. I see the military with its right winged bullshit fuck this town up. Bringing racsim here from all the members they house here from all the racist states like Kentucky, Tenn, West Viginia , Arkansas need I say more. Get to the real struggle, anyone can point fingers at politicians, change the country just focus on our needs! Peace to you all  MAX-Christine / / April 30, 2008I love OB! I am writing you because this election is critical and the money is pouring in from special interests aka developers that want to make OB look like a wasteland of 4-pack stucco condos like they did in so many other parts of SD. I run a website called developeralert.org . I am doing my best to provide info to the community on developer actions that are happening under the radar. That said, I guess I just wanna urge you and encourage you to get info out to readers about the money and where it is coming from. They want Aguirre out bad!!-The developers, the unions, the city people because of their pensions. They are really pushing Goldsmith and Goldsmith is a schill for special interests. Look what he did to Powayhe destroyed that town. He would be a disaster. Believe me I am totally on your sideyou have a great community and this election will be critical in saving it.Frank Gormlie // Jan 17, 2008 at 9:17 amThanks J. Stone; we did post that comment by Huckabeen on Jan. 16th.#J.Stone // Jan 16, 2008 at 12:50 pmWondering why no one is covering the Republican candidates and the nonsense they continue to spew. I think its important to keep track of them. For example, I havent seen any media coverage of Huckabees intensions of actually changing the Constitution to be more christian. This is scary shit, and some how the info needs to get out. Obviously the main stream media is choosing not to include this when they gush about Huckabees ratings and poll numbersHere are some idiotic comments hes made recently;From NBC/NJs Adam Aigner-TreworgyWARREN, Mich.  Huckabees closing argument to voters here this evening featured a few new stories and two prolonged sections on illegal immigration and Christian values.These two topics usually feature prominently in Huckabees stump speech, but last night he got specific, promising to build a border fence within 18 months if elected and elaborating on his belief that the constitution needs to be amended.[Some of my opponents] do not want to change the Constitution, but I believe its a lot easier to change the constitution than it would be to change the word of the living God, and thats what we need to do is to amend the Constitution so its in Gods standards rather than try to change Gods standards, Huckabee said, referring to the need for a constitutional human life amendment and an amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman.Huckabee often refers to the need to amend the constitution on these grounds, but he has never so specifically called for the Constitution to be brought within Gods standards, which are themselves debated amongst religious scholars. As a closing statement he asked the room of nearly 500 supporters to pray and then work hard, and in that order, to help him secure a victory in Tuesdays GOP primary.I also found this, could very well be a mockup/fake but who knowshttp://www.themishmash.com/2008/01/single-most-com.htmlLorrie // Jan 5, 2008 at 7:31 pmThis is terrific. Thank you! Hope it grows (in participation, if not in words).Patrick // Dec 23, 2007 at 7:40 pmEach time I read the Rag it seems to get better. You must have a lot of spare time on your hands, or youre a literary genius, or there are a lot of ghost writers in OB. While on a bike ride the other day I spotted a wonderful bumper sticker. U.S. out of OB!I like the updates on Blackwater, and I think articles on neo-liberalism & fascism are timely. I know those are broad & general, but there are so many instances where the fascists are winning-many instances that go unreported by anyone. Local reports about creeping fascism & militarism would be appreciated. Hope youve had a wonderful Winter Solstice Cocktail Evening.PatrickDave Sparling // Dec 10, 2007 at 2:37 pmAs a new resident of laid back OB I just want to say how happy I am to be here. A native of Phoenix and long time Zonie I only discovered OB a couple of years ago. It seems to be the perfect location for a old hippie liberal like myself. I hope to meet all of those who are involved in this venture.You can find me at Winstons drunk poet society every Monday night 6 to 8. I always wanted to be a writer, but never had a loft in NYC or a cabin in Key West. OB has been both to me, and I cant stop writing. Byron // Nov 28, 2007 at 7:44 amFrom Randi Rhodes web sitePhilip Giraldi| BIO | IM A FAN OF THIS BLOGGERThe Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention ActPosted November 26, 2007 | 10:06 AM (EST)There has been a long tradition of fear-mongering legislation in the United States directed against groups and individuals believed to threaten the established order. The first such measures were the Alien and Sedition Acts passed by Congress in 1798 during the administration of the second president of the United States John Adams. The Acts, consisting of four separate laws, made it more difficult to become a citizen, sought to control real or imagined foreign agents operating in the United States, and also gave the government broad powers to control sedition. Sedition was defined as resisting any law of the United States or any act of the President punishable by a prison sentence of up to two years. It also made illegal false, scandalous or malicious writing directed against either the government or government officials. The next President, Thomas Jefferson declared that three out of the four laws were unconstitutional and pardoned everyone who had been convicted under them.[for more of this article which was originally posted as a "Letter to the Editor", see the posted article itself.]OB Joe // Nov 18, 2007 at 10:29 pmCongrats! Id like to see more posts on OB however. Like, what is happening on Newport Ave, what is happening with the planned condos for the foot of Saratoga?#Frank Gormlie // Nov 3, 2007 at 5:24 pmEricRight on, Bro! Poor people do have a right to live at the beach, and thats been one of the principles that OB activists over the years have adhered to, most recently in a group called the Ocean Beach Grassroots Organization (OBGO). 5/7s of OBs residents are tenants, yet the threats of gentrification, over-development, and corporate-take-over of our main street businesses remain constant and ever alive. Since the early 70s theres been a community resistance to the urban planning designs of the establlishment and power structure; such landmarks as the stopping of the jetty in 1970, the saving of Collier Park, the passage of the 30 foot height limit in 1972. and the establishment of the OB Planning Board in 1976  the first democratically-elected community planning committee in the history of California  remain in our most recent community history. (See 1st OB Rag page). More recently, groups such as OBGO, the Coalition to Save OB, and community-minded businesspeople have made efforts to prevent Newport Avenue from becoming a strip of franchise-city. Its been an on-going battle to save OB and it aint over yet.Eric Parish // Nov 3, 2007 at 12:07 pmI havent been able to afford to live in OB for decades. The rent got to be too much back in 1983. Living a block from the beach were very happy years for me. It is nice to see the politics have survived. Never let them turn you into another Leucadia or Encinitas. Poor people should never have to abandon the beach.Frank // Nov 3, 2007 at 9:39 amGaryThank you for your report. There was nothing in todays Union-Tribune (11/3/07) about any protests in Venezuela. Keep them coming.Frank Gormlie G Ghirardi // Nov 2, 2007 at 7:09 pmI dont know if you consider this relevant for the Rag but it is hot off the press  GVenezuela: Two opposition confirmed Killed and eight wounded at the University of Zulia11-02-07 / 9:30PMMaracaibo -An incident of gun violence resulted in the confirmed death of one student and one unidentified person on the University of Zulia Campus today and eight wounded on the Eve of an Opposition march on Saturday and a Chavista march on Sunday on the opposite side of the country in the capital of Caracas. There are also unconfirmed reports that an additional two people have died from their wounds.Many pro government supporters feel that this was manufactured violence to disrupt the socialist constitutional referendum that is pending and put U.S. and International pressure on the Bolivarian movement and the PSUV party (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela) of Hugo Chavez. Student violence occurred throughout the week in staged confrontations by opposition groups in Caracas. Mayor Barreto had given the protesters a wide berth and there have been no serious injuries to government supporters or opposition protesters or retaliation by police against the students but many police, including a police chief negotiating with the protesters, sustained injuries by rioting students. Many images showing up in U.S. media coverage were of the violence of opposition student violence attributed to a response by students to police violence.Zulia Governor Rosales chose not to intervene on the student violence at the University of Zulia. Venezuelan law does not permit troops or municipal police to enter universities as they are considered autonomist zones that are self policed by university guards.The opposition political party, Primary Justice, ran as their presidential candidate Zulia Governor Rosales against Chavez in the last election.Reports on the government news channel in Caracas, Canal Ocho, are claiming that gunfire broke out during student elections at the Engineering School of the university as two rivaling opposition student parties, Un Nuevo Tiempo (A New Time) and University Christian Democracy, skirmished. Reports are sketchy about the death toll but it appears that two people were killed, a woman and a man.. Police officials on the government channel are saying that they have no one in custody and are still investigating the shooting and interviewing witnesses. The police official also interjected that students should not have permitted the entry of non-student outsiders into the voting proceedings. The corporate channels like Venevision and Globovision have been silent on the story.The student and allied opposition groups hope to instigate a U.S. military intervention poised as a humanitarian mission to restore their freedoms they claim have been denied them under the Chavez Government and as a pretext for removing Chavez from the hemisphere.Zulia is an area of Venezuela bordering Columbia. The U.S. military maintains the Plan Columbia drug eradication operation on the Columbian side. Paramilitary groups wage a campaign of extra judicial executions against those activists working it the mountainous border area to initiate and carryout government reform and social programs. FARC rebel troops also operate in this region and have been one of the primary issues for U.S. Foreign Policy grievances against the Chavez Government.  G. D. Ghirardi#Frank Gormlie // Oct 31, 2007 at 12:08 pmJackie  Youve struck several themes that our blog has attempted to illuminate: the inspiration and disheartenment that many of us have felt from our regions responses to the 2007 wildfires  the giving, generosity and solidarity of San Diegans for those evacuated and in need, but at the same time the governments failures  such as the lack of sufficient fire fighting aircraft, the reverse 9-1-1 calls only in English, orders for mandatory evacuations while not providing for fire protection, discriminating against immigrants during this crisis. Lets turn our anguish into discussions and actions to change it for the better.  FrankJackie McElveny // Oct 31, 2007 at 11:03 amOkay, now i cant figure out how to do a new post here. Im really not technolically challenged, its just not readily apparent. Sorry. Here is what I posted to one of my other groups tonight about the fires, Katrina, the present administration base, and how bureaucracy is crippling this country almost beyond redemption. Oh and also, about the good citizens of San Diego and about the role of media in our elections. Yep! All over the landscape..Okay, can I just call it like I see it? My heart goes out to all those who lost their homes, rich or poor, and I know and work with some of the rich ones (who lost homes): I work in medicine and they are doctors. I dont hold rich against them and have a good relationship with most of those I work with. BUT, read on.Im not even sure where Im going with this, Im finding my way. The people in New Orleans were considered disposable. Let me start there. Rich anybody is not disposable. This is the Base that Bush so blatantly refers to.Okay, next talking point, and Im still not sure where Im going: the citizens of this city are the real heroes in terms of aid! And it was like that with Katrina  people from all over the country converging with EXTREMELY necessary aid and BLOCKED by the #*!#-ing bureaucracy, read: federal government. Oh, sorry, you dont meet the regulations, cant help, these people are going to have to die..And die they did, thank you US government. Back to the citizens, ordinary San Diego people: friends of mine sheltered in Valley Center and one of them reports it was working VERY well until the Red Cross got involved. Yet more bureaucracy. I think this country is going to sink into the ocean from the weight of how completely bureaucratic it has become.As for those front and center with the media. It was heartening to know that Susan Davis and Donna Frye were right there quietly helping  and that was absolutely the best use of their time. But when the elections come around, they are going to be won or lost in the media, which is  well I dont know WHAT that is, maybe an indictment of where our society is at present. It actuallly WOULD have been good for Susan and Donna to make time for some media exposure. Barbara Boxer? I dont know where she was. Dianne Feinstein? I know where she was because my 80-year-old mom called me (yes, an elderly progressive in very sense of the word), sputtering, after the Bush press conference which I could not bear to watch. And, yes, there was our own Dianne, right up there at the podium (well, I didnt watch it, Im only relating what Mom told me) with all the right-wing establishment.Sorry for this disjointed, all-over-the-landscape post, but Im angry, Im sad, Im disheartened.sam hasz // Oct 26, 2007 at 11:56 pmIm going to see whether we can organize a watch-dog group in Ramona to handle our own situation when it comes to fire and other emergencies. The response so far has been positive. Im feeling like people want to take their government back and it starts on a local level.Monty Reed Kroopkin // Oct 26, 2007 at 9:08 pmDear Ocean Beach Rag,Congratulations and applause to Frank Gormlie and Patty Jones on the new OB Rag blog at http://obrag.org/, and on the seed of a new OB Rag publication. And I am very happy to see links to some recent articles on the new Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).Community press organizations like the original Ocean Beach Peoples Rag are still needed, and might find a new (and less expensive to sustain) life online (combined with downloadable pdf versions that are ready to print, for decentralized hard copy distribution).Please contemplate the story of sister publication, The Columbus Free Press. They have a good summary at http://www.freepress.org/about.php and their current online edition is at http://www.freepress.org/index2.php PLUS their hard copy editions can be viewed online at http://www.freepress.org/journal.php . Seems they actually have the Journal version done by a printer and distributed the old fashioned way.I would love to see not only the Rag grow again in this manner, but a number of other San Diego area newspapers presently defunct, or, I prefer to think, dormant. The New Indicator? The Street Journal? The start up costs to print an online edition are comparable to running a blog. The difference is the more involved range of content (and reporters) and the visual presentation. Doing layout is still doing layout, and publishing an online newspaper is more time consuming than producing a blog. The software is rather widely available, and not so expensive, especially for a group.I also invite readers to check out a press research webpage Im developing at http://www.newmds.org/node/36 . It is part of a new website for the Movement for a Democratic Society (which is a community-based project of the new Students for a Democratic Society). The site has links to the main SDS website and to the info page for the New Left Cafe listserv, and to the non-profit foundation which has been formed for fund-raising and other support work for SDS. One subject raised within SDS/MDS is a possible project to organize better communication and cooperation within the progressive press community. I see the potential for an effective global Left as tied greatly to our means of communication. We have a lot of work to do in this field.Yours for the Whole Damn Pie Shop (not just a piece of the pie) !Monty Reed KroopkinSan Diego SDS-MDS Chapter contactcc: many friends of the OB RagNew Left Cafe (discussion listserv of SDS-MDS)Share|{ 127 comments read them below or add one } Previous CommentsWayne RocheMay 29, 2010 at 6:53 amHey Frank and staffers at the Rag,I was just wondering if an OB memories section has ever been considered for the online Rag. I know that there are places for posting, but they are usually filled with political, activist, and current event comments. I was thinking more along the lines of a section that would allow people, like myself, either living presently, or in the past, to post their memories and experiences in OB specifically. I think it might even generate more readers. It might also be a section for old friends to re-unite.I would just be sad to see someones sentimental memory get lost between a couple of lengthy, heated political debates!Thanks for listening, Wayne RocheReplyLeon AlpertJune 19, 2010 at 1:14 pmBy treating the homeless as a single homogeneous group, the OB Rag is just as guilty of hehumanizing them as the anti-homeless groups. What I read is that there are some agressive panhandlers disturbing people and disrupting businesses. Some of the homeless are truly down on their luck and/or mentally ill and need help. Others choose this as a lifetyle . There is no blanket solution other than help people that really need it and get the others away.  No one needs to develope a European style social welfare state with high taxes, just so money can be thrown at every problem.I support  The Black and others in their efforts to deal with this problem. Stop supporting the panhandlers and encourage them to seek help and/or go away.ReplyPatty JonesJune 19, 2010 at 2:55 pmIm not really sure why you think we are treating the homeless as a single homogeneous group, but that is beside the point I want to make. I have read in other media that this sticker is aimed at the new breed of homeless, the aggressive panhandlers that have cell phones and credit cards The image on this sticker does not conjure thoughts of these types of people, but rather it depicts someone who is down on their luck and/or mentally ill and needs help. Youre right, there is no blanket solution, and throwing hate at an issue is worse than throwing money at it.If you dont want to throw your money at the problem by giving it to panhandlers then dont, but spending it on stickers and t-shirts with this message isnt going to help either.ReplyAbbyJune 21, 2010 at 10:50 amHow is selling a sticker an effort to do anything except make money?Not that thee is anything wrong with that, but lets not pretend a sticker is going to help deal with our homeless situation any more than sticking a magnet on your care does a thing to help our troops.ReplyKenlocJune 21, 2010 at 11:25 amThats all it really was at 1st Abby, but it struck a nerve here in OB. It seems most conversation has turned from the sticker to the issue of homelessness,which is a good thing.Positve or negative, at least it is putting more of a spotlight on the issue.ReplyFrank GormlieJune 21, 2010 at 12:21 pmThere ya go, Abby. If supposedly the Black has sold now a 1000 stickers  thats $2500. Let them take that money and donate to a homeless shelter or a local church that feeds the homeless.ReplyLee Harvey OsmondJune 19, 2010 at 5:14 pmI am all for the stickers. I am sick of the idiotic tolerance in OB that allows it to become a beachfront ghetto. The bums are getting out of hand, it is time someone did something positive about it. Why make it easy for a bum to be a bum? Sure, there are legitimate mental cases, but most bums are just bums. It is easier to panhandle than to get legitimate work, this is the case now and it was the case when economic times were better. Even OB businesses need to turn a profit to make it worth being in business, and bums hurt profits. You leftists seem to think profit making businesses are a bad thing, but without them we would ALL be bums.So, when panhandled by the street vermin, be sure to say HELL NO! Eventually they will get the message that they are not welcome here in OB.Replylane tobiasJune 21, 2010 at 11:36 amthese stickers (and now, hats and tshirts, and who knows, maybe coffee mugs and commemorative coins?) do nothing to promote any legitimate argument except to help the Black make a few extra bucks. If the folks who support the sticker instead were to rally around the message, not a product, and stopped giving  money to a business trying to capitalize on what seems to be a very personal and emotional issue, then maybe you would see more leftists as you call them willing to discuss shared positions in a less contentious manner. Until then, it seems that some in the OB community have been hoodwinked by a store trying to make a few extra bucks during tough times. It has nothing to do with capitalism or a main street trying to stay afloat. If the employees of The Black and other local businesses started giving the stickers away for free, then things would be different. In the meantime, they are profiteering off your emotions.ReplyEdwin Purnell-Hysmith JrJune 20, 2010 at 6:50 pmI am aware I am not the first nor the last to address this pressing issue. This message is to those who seek to prevent and obstruct the homeless from their rightful pursuit of happiness and liberty by unfair propaganda ( ie stickers, t-shirts,hats,etc.). Myself and my family along with others are crestfallen at the unjust and insideous way the homeless are being portrayed via The Black smoke shop employee and his campain to dehumanize the homeless community in O.B., this is injurious, and shameful to the homeless. The homeless have every right to pursue Happiness and liberty just as others in O.B.. O.B. is a very lovely normally welcoming beach community, however this propaganda is leaving a horrible stain on that perception. We live in a very welcoming country unlike China or Cuba. This is an outrage to any and all that believe in peace, love and understanding. There may be a few that are overly enthuastic and somewhat aggressive, that does not speak for the whole of them as a community.We have visited O.B. on busy Friday and Saturday nights and have parked in the lot by the wall that was mentioned by Mr. Anderson, we have never be harassed nor accosted by any homeless individual on any occassion. These stickers and any other publications of its kind is extreamly dangerous, ill thought, and down right prejudice. Myself and my family have done business in O.B. for many years and have given countless time and money and hard work to the O.B. community. However, this unfair campain of hate against the few homeless does not portray the O.B. community in a welcoming light. My wife and my family will no longer conduct business in O.B. and will instruct others we come in contact with to do the same. Unless this message of hate is replaced with a message of love, compassion and openess which O.B. use to be known for. We seek to unite the homeless to become organized and to protect their rights from this evil virus of prejudice being conducted through Mr. Anderson at The Black smoke shop. It appears to me that the author of this campain may have never been homeless himself, by this distasteful sticker and the way he refers to the homeless as Bums. To conclude I would like to end my message with a short paragraph from the book Reader authors  Marx & Engels The world had hither to allowed itself to be led solely by prejudices everything in the past deserved only pity and contempt. Now for the first time, the light of day the kingdom of reason. Henceforth suspersitition in justice prividledge opression were to be superceeded by eternal truth, eternal light, and equality. Based on nature and the inalienable rights of man.ReplyKenlocJune 21, 2010 at 10:40 amEdwin,  Take them all back to wherever you live and talk to us in a year.We dont need  your NIMBY money anyway.ReplyyippierebornJune 21, 2010 at 11:56 amkenloc  I think you have the term NIMBY confused. Not in my back yard is a term used to describe a community or group of people opposed to development projects or other institutions be included in the future planning of a community. Those who support the exclusion of the homeless (or the offensive bums, as described on the aforementioned stickers) are certainly a group that in this instance would claim to not want the homeless in their back yards or, in OB at all.  I assume by the veracity and intensity of the argument that the same people who would go out of their way to abuse and harrass a boycotter exercising free speech outside of a store would also oppose a plan to house or shelter the homeless right here in OB  an exercise close to the NIMBY heart . Me thinks maybe you need to research other communities that ousted the homeless both physically and philosophically in the same manner many in OB are contemplating, such as Santa Monica, and decide whether or not you will be able to afford to live here in 10 years if OB were to follow the same arc of development and overall sanitized living you are looking for.ReplyKenlocJune 21, 2010 at 12:59 pmyippie, I agree with our nimby definition.In this case it is not a development project or institution that folks are against.it is an issue. the homeless issue. it is fine for some of our homeless guests to act the way they do, as long as they do it in ob and not where i live. and you obecians should be tolerant of it dammit. whats wrong with you hippies anyway? as for your Santa Monica analogy, is that why we need all of the homeless to come to ob Yippie? So we can keep it affordable for you? I personally own a home in ob and wouldnt mind an increase in home values.Im sure if I do the research on Santa Monica the people that live there are not longing for the days when there town was a dump.Im getting a bit tired of people that want the homeless here because it keeps the town seedy and thats how you prefer it.help them get off the street. they arent here for your benefitReplyyippierebornJune 22, 2010 at 9:23 amI think maybe there wasnt enough explanation in there, so I understand why you would respond that way. The fact of the matter is that OB is majority tenants, not homeowners. When you have a population that can be easily subjugated like that, then you have to be mindful of the fact that simply saying bums out of OB is paving the way for more cultural changes that are just as simple minded and narrow. Nobody  NOBODY  is advocating that its okay for people to be drunk and aggressive in public. But there seems to be a blanket idea that every single person who happens to be homeless that spends time in OB is guilty of such, and that is just not true.When you start advocating that we should start arresting homeless folks, getting them out of OB, and cleaning up the town so HOME VALUES can go up, you are also opening up the entire community to a more rapid and aggressive redevelopment. OB is one of the only beachfront communities left in California that is still somewhat (and I say somewhat because it is still very expensive for what you get in the average 1 BR apt) affordable for regular working folks to live in. I can tell you this  once you start making it unaffordable for working types, the hippie-esque, laid back vibe is going to slowly dissipate and guess what? We will become an uber-wealthy community and the whole OB attitude just wont survive.Again, nobody is advocating that people should be getting away with crimes. that is a big misconception. As Sarah wrote below, if someone is doing something illegal, call the police. But dont criminalize everyone just because they dont have an address.ReplyjohnAugust 7, 2010 at 6:49 pmLOL, Santa Monica, the city that so wants to discourage visitors they hold their fourth of July fireworks display before dawn. Where you cant get a cup of coffee or a bite to eat after 1 am because whether by law or agreement, EVERYthing shuts down- 7-11, AM-PM, Dennys, you name it.Using Santa Monica as a model for operations is not a very rosy picture to paint.Help them get off the street.  Sure. Fix things so a minimum wage job puts a roof over your head and food in your belly, even allowing NO luxuries like booze, cable TV and toilet paper.See, all of a sudden the problem isnt so easy.ReplyWayne RocheJune 21, 2010 at 1:30 amFirst off, I am without a doubt, anti-sticker in this matter. But with all the bad press and negative reactions this sticker is creating, why cant The Black just take them off the shelf and resolve this issue. Are they afraid that they might hurt the feelings of the dude that brainstormed the idea? If the boycott does what boycotts are meant to do, then the company is sure to lose more money then theyd ever make from selling the damn things to begin with. So, owners of the The Black, Im sure that you took that into consideration when you saidSureprintm up.sounds like a good idea to me!Come on guys.this is just bad business. Im sure if you put your collective heads together, you could come up with a sticker, t-shirt, something, that would make EVERYBODY happy. In my opinion, thats GOOD business!Have a great week!ReplyKenlocJune 21, 2010 at 10:46 amI beleive it has become more than that to The Black. It is now a  we arent going to back down and let people dictate what we do and do not carry issue. The T shirts were an in your face jab back at the protest about the sticker.Replylane tobiasJune 21, 2010 at 12:44 pmso what you are saying, then, is that those who buy the sticker or t-shirts are displaying their support of free speech and free market, and not the message on the sticker or tshirt? this is one of the reasons all the boycott talk and media exposure was a bad idea, IMHO. if nobody knew about these stickersthen the first batch wouldve sat on a shelf next to the I drank the worm shot glasses.ReplyKenlocJune 21, 2010 at 1:15 pmi agree with  Lane. the 1st batch would have been the last batch if not for the free advertisingReplyWayne RocheJune 21, 2010 at 1:28 pmand I suppose that if every time we see something that we think is wrong, we should just keep our beliefs to ourselves, and our mouths shut, and maybe itll all just go away, or end up on the shelf next to the shot glasses that say I ate the worm  Yeahthatll work. Waitisnt that how the communist governments work?just a thought.ReplyKenlocJune 21, 2010 at 2:08 pmThat seems to be what many are advocating Wayne,but in the other direction.If someone is getting drunk in public and behaving poorly we are being told we should be tolerant and look the other way. Speak out against homeless folks acting like idiots and your labeled intolerant.Or should we keep our beliefs to ourselves,mouths shut and the problem will go awayReplylane tobiasJune 22, 2010 at 9:26 amIt would have gone away, the first batch was printed as parody and only a few sold. Had people sort of done things on their own, complaining to those who BOUGHT them rather than turning it into a big story, there wouldnt be any tshirts or hats. As the manager of the Black, Ken said in an article recently and here on the Rag, the tshirts were a direct response to the boycott.ReplyFrank GormlieJune 22, 2010 at 9:43 amYeah, and maybe if those first pesky Nazis in Germany were ignored, they would have gone away also. You dont deal with bigotry by ignoring it. We have shown a spotlight on something that is not Ocean Beach, that does not fit into the communitys tradition of tolerance.Replydc0deSeptember 27, 2010 at 10:02 pmIrony is so ironic  Hows the East Coast treating you Lane?ReplyLeon AlpertJune 21, 2010 at 8:52 amTo all the pro-homelss people: I dont see a solution for dealing with the agreesive (bordering on assault) panhandlers. A few bad apples can spoil the barrel. Someone actually has to work to generate income and taxes. We cant all be advocates and government employees. Bussinesses large and small are the lifeblood of a community and abusing them to protect the panhandlers without proposing solutions is idiotic.The Black has taken a stand and caused a dialogue. Hopefully a solution that is fair to everyone involved will emerge.ReplyFrank GormlieJune 21, 2010 at 12:19 pmThe Black didnt take a stand. We did and we caused the dialogue. The Black has a right to sell it and we have a right to boycott the Black. The sticker is not a solution, neither are the T-shirts and hats with the same image. The Black is making money off a community  and national problem without proposing a solution. In every barrel of life, Leon, there are bad apples.  Theres bad cops, but all cops arent bad. Theres bad merchants, but all merchants arent bad. Theres bad lawyers, but all lawyers arent bad. So- why then among the homeless are all homeless bad because of a few bad apples?ReplyLeon AlpertJune 21, 2010 at 10:52 amShow some support for the businesses and people who actually contribute to the community. Come up with a solution to deal with the agressive panhandlers.ReplySarah LittleJune 21, 2010 at 11:11 amHeres a solution.  When you are threatened by an aggressive panhandler pull out your cellphone, call 911, report the crime and snap a picture of the person who assualted you so they can be appropriately dealth with.  Punish the person who broke the law, not the group to which you perceive they belong.Replylane tobiasJune 21, 2010 at 12:38 pmwell said, sarah.ReplySarahJune 21, 2010 at 4:42 pmThanks, Lane.  The grammar was tricky at the end there.   ReplyLeon AlpertJune 21, 2010 at 12:22 pmI bet most of the pro homeless crowd has never owned a business and had to make payroll, paid rent, etc. The problem started with the agressive panhandlers who have bothered people and businesses. They most likely have cost legitimate businesses money. Come up with a solution not a complaint about stickers. Even if The Black gave them away gratis, you would be complaining.Replylane tobiasJune 21, 2010 at 12:39 pmyeah, but the argument that the stickers actually have meaning would be more legitimate if you didnt have to pony up to put one on your car. the complaint would still be that the stickers are intolerant, but those who displayed them could say that it was about a position on an issue, not an act of consumerism.ReplyLeon AlpertJune 21, 2010 at 12:30 pmBad Cops, Bad People (criminals) go to jail. Shoulnt the same standards be applied to panhandlers who assault people  and disrupt commerce? The Black has every right to make a profit if they have a product consumers wish to buy. Give a solution to the agreesive pandandling problem and the demand for the stickers, etc. will most likely disappear.ReplyWayne RocheJune 21, 2010 at 1:09 pmThe homeless issue is one that I personally experienced for a brief time while I was  living in OB, so I know that not all of the street people are bums or aggressive. Im also proof that not all of the homeless stay that way indefinitely. Regardless, its not an issue thats going to just go away by bitching about it. I was wondering Arent there vagrancy laws in SD? Couldnt they be legally removed from the streets and placed in halfway housing or shelters in order to receive help?Its just that everyone is saying that all they see is complaints about the homeless issue, but that nobody is offering a solution. The idea is that the ones who really do need and want the help, will take it. The ones that dont want it might think twice about returning to OB in fear of being picked up again. Whether it would work or notI dont know. Its just a thought.ReplyKenlocJune 21, 2010 at 1:32 pmEveryone would complain that the police are harassing the homeless Wayne. It seems to be a problem without solution. Theres folks that want the homeless here,folks that dont,and folks that dont care either way. Theres cops,business owners,activists locals and tourists to appease.It seems impossible to come up with a solution that everyone will agree on. I personally feel that many old school obecians dont want the homeless issue addressed so we can keep OB OB(new sticker?) and fight off gentrification. That seems to be an injustice to homeless people as well,doesnt it? Can OB be the same place without a large homeless population? I think it can. Some beleive thats not possible.We must have homeless here or too many tourists will  come. Ob will be come unaffordable. Is the homeless population the only way ob can hang on to its identity?ReplyAllanJune 22, 2010 at 2:10 pmI appreciate your comments. States like California are clearly digging their own grave with social engineering . Activists degrade their communities by labeling community-building people as bigots. Potential leaders and volunteers opt out when political correctness becomes more important than solving problems.The OB Chamber of Commerce could organize a job/training campaign among its members. Job/training/program opportunities could be offered to the street people willing to learn, work, detoxify. That should clarify who the professional hustlers are. Then OB must respect its taxpayers and laws and deal decisively with the rest.ReplyJohn SteinsvoldJune 21, 2010 at 8:35 pmAn Alternative to Capitalism (which we need here in the USA)The following link takes you to an essay titled: Home of the Brave? which was published by the Athenaeum Library of Philosophy: http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/steinsvold.htm John SteinsvoldReplyGary GhirardiJune 22, 2010 at 11:27 amJohn.

It will be interesting to see her report at the end of July.ReplyjohnAugust 3, 2010 at 4:21 amInteresting, but quite unworkable. Money is simply a tangible quantifier placed on those very things you mention- products, labor, resources. Youd have committees getting together to vote or agree on the allocation of which, yet you cannot assume all to have the benevolent or philanthropical attitude you have. Its human nature for many individuals to be greed, wouldnt take long for the system to become corrupted.Something I didnt see you talk about- the US dollar became the international standard after WW2 with Bretton Woods and backed by gold. In 1973 Kissinger made a deal with the Saudis that changed that so that it was backed by OPECs exports. Google petrodollars if you dont believe that.In essence any country needing OPEC oil all these years needed dollars to buy it. So they had to acquire US dollar assets, and give real goods and resources in exchange- the Saudis and other OPEC producers then  pumped the dollars they got back to us.A license to print money out of worthless paper, that by 2000, saw the US controlling 50% of the worlds wealth.What could go wrong with that?Well it had to end. Worse we got used to the prosperity, didnt plan  ahead, and  got lazy thinking it was okay to teach a huge asian country all of our manufacturing secrets and just sit back and consume their output.If the devaluation is slow, it will be painful but manageable. A crash is unlikely as anyone quickly divesting only harms the value of their holdings- though watch out for jokers in the deck pulling a wild card.Many believe that was what motivated the invasion of Iraq, to foil plans by Saddam along those lines.Whatever.

Should the San Diego City Council approve advertising at the Citys beaches, then in addition to blight, small enterprises such as ours may need to rethink their position.  In addition, the ongoing beach cleanup efforts of nonprofits  I Love A Clean San Diego, CoastKeeper, Surfrider, San Diego River Foundation, etc.  may be undermined.Dog Beach Dog Wash, open over 17 years, has sponsored more than 200 beach cleanups.  We have paid for and stocked more than three million (3,000,000) cleanup bags at a cost of more than $50,000.  We have never sought recognition for our community activism.  However, we will not participate if a corporate sponsor appears to take credit for our efforts, and the efforts of City beach maintenance crews and the thousands of volunteers who contribute to the cleanliness, health & safety of our beaches.  A corporate sponsor would need to provide service and product (bags and trash disposal) on an ongoing basis.  It is not enough to write a one-time check for $500,000.  We hope the City Council will rethink this short-sighted solution for the current deficits.ReplyFrank GormlieJuly 30, 2010 at 2:27 pmThis was great, Mindy. Mind if we also post it at a new article? Please come back, girl, and share your thoughts.ReplyjohnAugust 3, 2010 at 4:02 amHey Frank, heres a shocker, Im actually reconsidering the Iraq war in a negatively speculative light, though maybe its all conspiracy theory stuff.What do you think about the Depleted Uranium (in ammo) issue?They started putting that in US amunition stocks around 1980, now most of it has it, supposedly for its armour piercing capability. They say its safe and point to its low radioactivity, yet of course that is still elevated against background levels.  Heres the kicker though: It turns out that there is a 1943 Army report that proposed the use of depleted uranium dust on the battlefield or on whole countries.  The gift that keeps on giving, causing cancer for 4.5 million years (half life of U-236) and a burden on the whole countrys ability to wage war.  See DU in its whole solid form, as the DOD maintains, is pretty safe- a little radioactive but get more than a few feet away and its harmless.However we let loose some 4 MILLION pounds of DU ammunition so far, and when a DU round hits an object up to 70% of it turns to DUST.DU dust is HIGHLY dangerous because at that point it is easily ingested into the body in many ways,  breathing it, in your food, water, even in the pores of your skin. (though Im unsure if the skin absorbtion is permanent) The U-236 particles are retained in the body,  do not pass through, and those DU particles that when whole were harmless because who walks around with a pocketful of DU ammo- are now allowed to emit cell destroying radioactivity to tissue in the body several inches from where they lay.Now that is all factual, true, undeniable stuff- and I can dig up that Army report for reference if you like.Some New World Order conspiracy theorists go a step further into speculating how convenient it would be to spread 4 million pounds- or at least 70% of it- of DU dust over a country with a lot of angry muslims that just happened to have the worlds largest proven reserves of conventional petroleum. Get to control the oil well into the next century with all those people not able to put up much of a fight over it when theyre all droping dead from cancer-And those who did it and could bear witness, (our soldiers) doing the same.Doing double duty for population control, on  the American side it only really targets the lower class who joins the military. David Rockefeller, whose Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission pull the strings on most all of the puppets in Washington, makes no bones about population control as a goal for future civilization.As it would make the area not particularly safe for inhabitants for some 4.5 million years, the level of evil necessary to plan and execute this is unfathomable.Well within the realm of some politicians. (and from the testimony of Aaron Russo, the Rockefellers as well) What do you think?ReplyFrank GormlieAugust 3, 2010 at 6:52 amJohn, I am shocked. Good for you. And this issue, depleted uranium in ammo, was one of those lower-level issues masked by the more over-arching issue of the war itself.

Did you know that if someone has to come out to the house and kill those bees you have to pay for it because they need a license to poison the bees  or whatever they do to get rid of it?  Did you know that even if you did not know the hive was there it is still your responsibility?    Now  I am wondering if the skunk I am trying to get rid of spays a person walking past my house if I responsible for any damage that wild skunk may cause that person?  Where do we draw the line?  Birds pooping on someones head while walking under a tree near my house? If it is on the street side can we sue the city for a shampoo?  How about a foxtail getting into my dogs ear?

HicksNovember 28, 2010 at 4:20 pmFor the Veterans Who Support Our CommunityTiffany HicksSince 1899, the VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) has striven to serve deserving people; particularly veterans, their families, and their communities.  And, with each new individual membership, it grows stronger.Though there are 25 VFW Posts within a 25 mile radius of San Diego County; local veterans, whose military services span from WWII to current active duty, continue to serve our small community of Ocean Beach through local VFW Post 1392.VFW provides assistance and advocacy for veterans. Post 1392 provides, clothing food and small loans for those in need. Additionally, Post 1392 provides funeral expenses of deceased veterans, should the families require such assistance.Local children benefit every Christmas as VFW Posts 1392 host toy drives to provide for needy OB families.  Whereas traditional toy drives focus mainly on the youngest of children, Post 1392 also, provides higher end price toys for teenagers, with a heart to include all children at Christmas time.Additionally, Post 1392 sponsors Thanksgiving and Christmas food drives and provides meals for Ocean Beach families in need.VFW Post 1392 also focuses its efforts and support toward the local homeless population. Homeless persons are given blankets for warmth through the winter season, clothing and holiday meals. Food assistance is not limited to holidays; should a homeless individual need food they can come in anytime and if food is available it will be provided without question.The VFW Post 1392 has a heart and a mission to serve Ocean Beach as a community. Igniting patriotism in the hearts of those who both, reside and visit Ocean Beach. Members raise 97 American Flags, lining Newport Avenue for each National Holiday. Post 1392 erected and continues to care for the Ocean Beach Vietnam Memorial. One member, Mary Leffler, designed the plaque that commemorates this memorial. This plaque has since been replicated and now marks memorials in Hawaii, Virginia, Florida, and Washington.VFW Post 1392 supports 25 charities; including an orphanage, several local schools, Special Olympics, Firemans Fund, U.S. Army National Library and Ocean Beach Womens Club.A recent business decision on the part of the landlord of the building Post 1392  has occupied over 27 years, forces the VFW chapter to find a new location with only a three month notice to vacate the premises they call home. As of January 1st, 2011, despite their self support as a non-profit and pride in the Post they serve as things stand today, they have nowhere to go.I asked newly elected Quartermaster, Vic Tulsie, what we, as a community, can do to help as the 180+ members of Post 1392s move forward in efforts to locate and acquire a new building to carry forward their many community philanthropic activities.Quartermaster Tulsie stated that VFW, supports itself and its causes by two resources; their community thrift store and the canteen. Here, in the canteen, veterans share their camaraderie as soldiers, mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. Post 1392 needs to acquire a property in Ocean Beach to accommodate both the thrift store and their liquor zoning. He also stated it would be helpful if the City would help them in their efforts to move their liquor license when they do acquire a new location.With his new position, recently elected Quartermaster, Tulsie, who until two months ago was still in active duty in our military, shared with me that the joy in his position at Post 1392 is that I have been given a chance to help as many people as I can. As he lists the achievements he has made, you can see the pride he has in his work, in his Post and in this community that they serve. He ended the conversation with the simplest of words, When a veteran comes through the door that is in need, I feel confident that I can help.It is our sincere hope that we all acknowledge the service, duty and sacrifice that VFW Post 1392 has provided us over the last 27 years and that we will lend our support for them in this, their time of need. May we show our gratitude and respect to those who exemplify patriotism each and every day.Dear readers, please take a moment and ask yourselves; how can I help VFW Post 1392 find a new home?ReplyilovetheoutdorsDecember 10, 2010 at 10:11 amHello Obragsters , On Dec 9 there was a power outage for over an hour in north ob?
