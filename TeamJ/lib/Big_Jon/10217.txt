There are many times that are special to a child starting out their journey of life. One of lifes full circles occurs when those young steps are taken in the company of a grandparent, whose precious wisdom is shared with the child. Fishing for Time; is a poem of hope. It is about the hope that we have for a child learning from the passing on of the generations of knowledge and wisdom; that hopefully we have ourselves, also learnt from. We are truly blessed when our lessons come from those who have experienced their lives; their way; so that we may be enriched in our life; with the hope that eventually we have the opportunity, to pass on that enrichment. Through changing times and generations, this one thing should never be wasted or lost. Time spent between the generations creates special times in which a life circle moves forward and provides a mutual hope of happiness and sense of purpose. Enjoy this visual story of such a situation; About Fishing for Time; first in the series of Life Circles. Remember the shark we saw. It's the simple things count. Life frames in a blink.

More than Love, Hope and Time.Take the time to take time.Sadly in western culture we have lost the true purpose and meaning of having elderly family members. In this respect, we have also done an injustice to those, whom without, we would not have gained this precious thing we call life. So often the elderly have lost the opportunity to pass on their knowledge and wisdom, to the newer members of a family. In that way, the most important family history and it's relevance, is also lost. We are poorer for the loss.We forget that one day, we too will reach the sunset of our lives. For many reasons, many tend to not see how quickly our children grow and our grandparents leave us. So many cultures understand and support those special relationships between the young and old. In that way, wisdom is preserved and developed.Stand back and watch, what happens when those two generations spend time together. If you are unfortunate in not having access to the wisdom of the elderly in your life; then take the time to learn from an elderly person, who has no family. The first lesson you will learn is; that you can never listen too much. You may also find that you have helped another person to complete a life circle that they may never have achieved, without you.  I hope that you have enjoyed Life Circles: Poems of Hope: About Fishing for Time.  Below are links to more works in the Life Circles series.

Wise words indeed.alekhouse12 months ago Charming poem. Thanks.poetlorraine12 months ago that was refreshingly lovely.  Parents and grandparents that spend no time with their children miss out on so muchPearldiver12 months ago Hi TP, Thanks for reading this. It is that time of year when these things don't happen for many. Take care. Have a great Xmas.Pearldiver12 months ago Hi Alek, thanks for reading and your comment. Glad you enjoyed it. Have a great Xmas. Take Care.Pearldiver12 months ago Hi Brenda, Thank you for your comments and for enjoying this work. You are quite right and it's a sad fact that the loss can never be replaced. Take Care.. Have a great Xmas.prettydarkhorse12 months ago hmmm, you talked too much, hhmmm Mr Rob, this is an awesome hub, I like this very much as I adore children and how they interact with their parents or grandparents. Knowledge which are passed to one generation to the next is one way of enriching the next in line so to speak or the other generation.I love your poem and it shows bonding and love too, the exchange of words is very nice, MaitaShalini Kagal12 months ago Very poignant Pearldiver - loved it - and you are a wonderful poet! In India, the old are still listened to, looked after and respected to a large extent - but the times they are a changing - and it's sad how the the ties are breaking. Like you, I feel some of children's best moments are when they are with the elders in the family, listening or sharing the silence. Thank you for a wonderful hub!maven10112 months ago Rob...Beautifully expressed, my friend...Yes, they are a captive audience when fishing with them...I did much the same with my son, only we played 18 holes of golf, so I had him " captive " for four hours....amazing what comes out, from both of us, during those four hours...Thank you for this...LarryLaura du Toit12 months ago It's not only the children that are enriched when spending time with grandparents. Your life takes on a new dimension when you take time out to spend with your grandchildren. You are reminded of carefree innocence and unconditional love once again. It is rejuvenating and priceless. The best time of our lives are those spent with our grandchildren!Thanks for sharing your poem!tantrum12 months ago wonderful poem, full of wise words !thanks !! :)Pearldiver12 months ago Hi Maita, Thanks for reading this and your comments; but no this was not about me or talking too much; which as you know I do hahaha.  It's more about how easy it is to communicate when a common interest is developed. The older usually has that power to set it in place; but must let the younger suggest it to be their idea. Take care and have a great Xmas Maita.Pearldiver12 months ago Hi Shalini, Thank you for reading and your excellent comments. It will be sad to see those days change in India or the East, as I feel it is us in the West that should be making the change; back to those ways. Of course, the cultures who honour their elders are much older cultures and those that don't tend to be newer. Take care and have a great Xmas Shalini.Pearldiver12 months ago Hi there Larry, Yes, I should have thought about golf being a great leveller, especially with what's been going on at the top. That was a good move on your part and keeping him 'tied up' like that probably helped your score on the back 9 hahaha. You are a wise man Larry, in far more ways than that and I'm sure your captive would agree with me (without a rope hahaha). You guys have a great Xmas and Take Care. Thank you for reading this work... tight lines.Pearldiver12 months ago Hi Laura, Quite right in your comments. Thanks for reading this work. I will look forward to those days and hope I don't have too many lines on my face when they happen. You have a great Xmas with yours and Take Care.Pearldiver12 months ago Hi Tantrum, Cheers for reading my ramblings and your kind comment. My works are almost as good as yours. Have a great Xmas and Take Care Ok.rebekahELLE12 months ago so beautiful. I loved reading each word and the images it brought to me. such a natural flow between the generations.I could hear the young boy speaking and his grandfather.last week my oldest son turned 28. for his birthday, I gave him my fathers Soldiers Training Manuel (a small leather bound book) and a medal from his service in WW11. It was very touching to see the immediate bond between generations. Thank you for sharing this beautiful poem and tribute. :)Pearldiver12 months ago Hi rebekahELLE, Thanks for reading this work and your kind comments. Like you I gave my son my grandfather's discharge papers etc. from his war service, as he had not known my granddad. I'm sure your son would have appreciated that gift as much as mine did. Thanks again rebekahELLE, have a great Xmas and take care.Candie V12 months ago PD.. You have spoken my life, the wisdom passed down from 3 generations for me to know and love and learn from.  Thank you, this meant a lot to me, now with 2 generations under me to love and share with.  The circle spins around!!Pearldiver12 months ago Hi Candie, Long time..hope you have been ok. Thanks for reading this and your comments. You are so right in what you say and I'm sure your younger crew share that respect and appreciation. You take care my friend and have a great Xmas.Money Glitch12 months ago Hhhmmm, a lot of wisdom within this hub. "Young Hope links to Old Hope" and "Each Circle of Life forms a Life" are thought provoking truths, that some people seem to be missing out on now-a-days...I really like this poem. Thanks for sharing!Pearldiver12 months ago Hi MG, Thanks for reading this work and your positive comments. Yes, I agree that many seem to fall short on the understanding of this today. We can not overlook the fact that communication is a two way thing; so in that respect if the older party never gained the ability, then it is a safe bet that inability has been passed on to the next generation. Take care and have a great Xmas.keira712 months ago I love your work. Have a lovely Christmas my dear friend.:DPearldiver12 months ago Hi Keira, Thank you for that and you have a great Xmas too.

Very heart-warming :-)Pearldiver11 months ago Hi Sophs, Thanks for reading this work and your kind comment, I'm glad you enjoyed it.  Look forward to reading some of your works. Take care.blue parrot8 months ago Do you know how to put text in as a picture? It is a way to control the formatting which on HubPages you can't control much, for instance the spacing between the lines.But if you write the poem on a Word or Open Office Doc and then copy it and paste it on Windows Paint or even better on Open Office Draw you can save it and then change it into a JPEG or a GIF and publish it here either as a very small rectangle or full size.I am not a poet, but have often put other people's poetry on my posts, not yet here, but elsewhere, and it makes the accompanying text more approachable for those many people who can't read verse. -- Maybe I ought to write a hub about it!:-)sagbee7 months ago Beautiful poem.. seems more of a song to me.. written very well with all the feel... thanks for sharing.. :)Micky Dee7 months ago Came back for another taste!Pearldiver7 months ago Hi Blue Parrot, thanks for reading this work. I'm not sure I have found the relevance of your comment yet; but thanks for showing me that this hub inspired you to write. Take care.Pearldiver7 months ago Hi sagbee, thank you for taking the time to read this work and your kind comments. If I could write music then I'm sure I would spend alot of time on the lyrics writing songs. Thanks for that.... you take care.Pearldiver7 months ago Hi Micky Dee, Cheers for liking my work and the thumbs up. All the best mate and take care.equealla6 months ago How I long now for my grandparents. They have taught me so much with such a lot of joy. I miss them.Pearldiver6 months ago Hi equealla, thank you for reading this work. I guess if I have helped you remember and think about your grandparents then my words have achieved what they were formed to do. In the life circle, we get to pass on what we have learnt from them don't we. Take care.equealla6 months ago You did not only manage to help me remember them, they have been with me, right by my side, as your words brought them in my presence. You have a way with words, like I said before.And yes, I would not have been half the person I am today, if it was not for them. These qualities is helping my children now - life circle.Pearldiver6 months ago Hi again equealla, thank you for that. Yep.. I think that at the end of your life, if you can see the positive things about you that you have passed on within your grandchildren; then you have had a good life. (Even if your kids never listened to you! lol.)Take Care.epigramman6 months ago ..words ... all words ... thoughts ... all thoughts ... are very lucky to be in your esteemed company .....Pearldiver6 months ago Hi epigramman, thanks for reading this work.
