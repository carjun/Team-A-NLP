Without a scapegoat the left is helpless.#4January 10, 2011 at 12:20 pm Twisted Sister commented:The Left, along with their allies in abortion, Marxism, Communism, Islam, anarchists, euthanasia, and Socialism, are a blood-drenched, God-hating movement if there ever was one. Limbaugh was right about these Democrats. He said If they are speaking, they are lying.#5January 10, 2011 at 12:21 pm donabernathy commented:Go to the Play Bookhttp://www.crossroad.to/Quotes/communism/alinsky.htmroflmao#6January 10, 2011 at 12:26 pm listingstarboard commented:Interesting post on The Real Barack Obama apparently the school that Loughner attended from 9th grade on was  part of a network of schools BILL AYERS conceptualised called Smaller Learning Communities, was funded by CHICAGO ANNENBERG CHALLENGE(which Ayers founded), Ayers recruited Obama to work at the CAC, while Obama was there he provided funding for these Samll Learning Community schools. Jared Loughner was a product of a school curriculum that Bill Ayers invented and Obama helped implement.

Jim you need to see this.http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=130611046951544#19January 10, 2011 at 12:50 pm Rose commented:I love Franklin Graham.  He is having an increasingly difficult time keeping his thoughts about politics to himself,  since the days when the State Dept did nothing at all about the Sudanese Govt dropping bombs on him and his hospital, DECADES before any Liberals were concerned about the state of genocide by Muslim govt forces in Sudan.Franklin Graham is a very fine man. And his sister Anne is a very fine woman, too.  Fabulous Parents!!! And it shows!!!#20January 10, 2011 at 12:51 pm GrayRider commented:For some on the Left to try to place blame before an investigation has properly occurred is itself inciting hatred!That hits the nail right on the head!#21January 10, 2011 at 12:54 pm Mad Hatter commented:Nick I agree, we can disagree about things and still be civil.  But when I hear people in the media try to place blame on the Tea Party, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, and Rush Limbaugh, as a conservative, Im not going to sit by and allow them to rush to judgment and hold a trial by media as they attempt to link conservatives to this mass murder that took place.I will continue to point out what the media is trying to pull off here, and thats using a tragedy for their political gain since they are obsessed with discrediting those that I listed above.#22January 10, 2011 at 12:55 pm RedBeard commented:After a weekend of mindless and spittle-flecked screeching by the far left, its nice to hear reasoned voices speaking out today.#23January 10, 2011 at 1:00 pm bg commented:++donabernathy #5   i believe most of what she stated ismeant for student ears so to speak..BELATED HAPPY NEW YEAR OBAMALIBSKYITES!!Frances Fox Piven Rings in The NewYear By Calling for Violent Revolution[Shes considered by many as the grandmother of using the American welfare state to implement revolution. Make people dependent on the government, overload the government rolls, and once government services become unsustainable, the people will rise up, overthrow the oppressive capitalist system, and finally create income equality. Collapse the system and create a new one. [.]In a chilling and almost unbelievable editorial again in The Nation (Mobilizing the Jobless, January 10/17, 2011 edition), she calls on the jobless to rise up in a violent show of solidarity and force. As before, those calls are dripping with language of class struggle. Language she and her late husband Richard Cloward made popular in the 60s.So where are the angry crowds, the demonstrations,sit-ins and unruly mobs? she writes.[.][T]he out-of-work have to stop blaming themselves for their hard timesand turn their anger on the bosses, the bureaucrats or the politicians whoare in fact responsible.Only then, once their rage has been properly stoked, can the angry takeaction. And when they do, sh[e] says, the protesters need targets.For Piven, the best targets are the people or organizations capable ofmaking some kind of response to angry demands. Regular demands, notice,just wont do. No, people must be fired up and not easily deterred. Angryand not quickly placated.[.]seems to me that Jared and Frances have a lot in creativecommon, they also  repeat their creative selves quite often..the only reason i can think of as to why the idiots cant seethe writing on the wall is, they are the ones writing on it..which, in turn, is why they see us as being the idiots,  and so far i have toagree, also wouldnt say we (the American people) have the advantage atthe moment, and imho,  its only going to worsen..  funny, not so much..==#24January 10, 2011 at 1:02 pm Nick D. commented:Mad Hatter, I think theres a key piece missing here in the accusations: causation.  How do we know what caused this mad gunman to do what he did?  Did overheated rhetoric inspire him to pick up a gun?  At this point, I think thats just speculation.Having said that, I think bombastic rhetoric cheapens the debate and undermines civil discourse, no matter who it comes from.  I see examples everywhere, including right here in this comment thread.  Do you?#25January 10, 2011 at 1:06 pm Rock commented:Just the same S.O.P. of the Chicago Way thugs. And by the way Im tired of hearing about turning down the rhetoric, When the Communist in Chief and his lap dogs stop with their bully pulpit demands, and accusations, maybe just maybe that is possible, but the days of turning the other cheek are long gone.#26January 10, 2011 at 1:08 pm Mad Hatter commented:I agree, people get too heated up on emotion and say things that arent very smart.  Youre right, we dont know who inspired this killer, but if youve been watching the media over the past 24 hours, theyve been leading into the well, theres really only one source that drove him type of attitude theyre going with.When the media, including this horrible Sheriff, start pointing fingers at talk radio and the Tea Party, theyre conducting journalistic malpractice.  Theyre not getting away with that type of wreckless reporting anymore.#27January 10, 2011 at 1:13 pm Nick D. commented:The thing is, Mad Hatter, they ARE going to keep reporting in the way they have.  The beauty of the First Amendment is that we can stand up and call people out when theyre mistaken or misleading.  But guess what?  The tradeoff is that they get to keep saying what they were saying before.  IMHO, we cant let ourselves lose our cool because someone is saying something we dont like.  Someone will ALWAYS be saying something we dont like.Rock, if turning the other cheek was good enough for Jesus, its good enough for me.  Dont let yourself get pushed off the path, brother.#28January 10, 2011 at 1:15 pm bg commented:++RBO News & Views: The Left Is Insane Edition[Allahu Palin  MSM not delusional?Allahu Palin MSM not delusional?: Tim Blair at The Daily Telegraph points out: When Nidal Malik Hasan murdered 13 people at Fort Hood inNovember 2009, he offered a loud clue about his motivation:Eyewitnesses say suspected gunman Nidal Malik Hasanshouted Allahu Akbar or God is great before opening fire        But few wanted to hear it. So the guy screams an Islamic oath at the top of his lungsthen commences killing people. Nothing to see here, folks. . . .Now to Tucson, Arizona, where six people are dead and Democrat congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is seriously injured following another gun rampage. Attacker Jared Lee Loughner has thus far offered no clue at all about why he did it. Apparently the fellow is a drug-using gamer whom one former classmate recalls as left wing, a political radical, reclusive, a pot head and quite liberal. Hed met Giffords four years ago and thought her stupid & unintelligent. Besides that background and Loughners MySpace and YouTube rantings, thats all we have. Theres no Allahu Akbar here. Yet  incredibly  many clearly heard a cry of Allahu Palin.more @ link..'Psychological Causes of Political Madness'["A social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice, voluntary cooperation and moral integrity  as liberals do," he says. "A political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent, drive, personal appeal and work ethic, and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population  as liberals do. And a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over-regulates and over-taxes the nation's citizens, corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state  as liberals do."[.]The roots of liberalism  and its associated madness  can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind, he says. When the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims, rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives, the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious.]==#29January 10, 2011 at 1:16 pm greenfairie commented:Causation?  Schizophrenia and a depraved heart.  The man had some kind of fixation on Rep. Giffords since 2007.  He was delusional.  He scared everyone he encountered, even being removed from classes for his creepy behavior.  He used drugs.  Now it appears he also had some sort of thing for the occult/Satanism.  An acquaintance of his said he probably did it to cause chaos.  People are always going to have bombastic rhetoric and say things that are out of bounds and in bad taste.  But Im not going to sit by and let the entire American center right suffer an electronic lynching by ghouls out to shut us all up.#30January 10, 2011 at 1:21 pm Mad Hatter commented:Its not so much theyre saying something we dont like, theyre saying something that they have no proof or evidence to back up what they say, yet, theyre reporting it as if its the truth.  Thats activism, and propaganda disguised as journalism.#31January 10, 2011 at 1:27 pm averagemelon commented:This was precisely the moment the Liberal Left was waitiing for. Dont you remember Pelosi feigning fear eighteen months ago about the tea party and how it might start killing people? They WANT violence to erupt to blame American patriots and illegally grab total control all the while cooing that it is being done in the name of our protection.They really think we are stupid.#32January 10, 2011 at 1:28 pm bg commented:++greenfairie #29 that reminded me of this..[Information is leaking that Barack Obama was treated for mental related illnesses in the 70's and early 80's and may have been prescribed anti-psychotic medications.

Tell the truth. We believe that radical teachers should work in schools in working class neighborhoods, in community or junior colleges. Radicalize other teachers, organize the parents, teach and encourage your students. Health workers can choose hospitals and clinics in poor communities. Cultural activists, street players, artists, writers should propagandize and relate to poor and working people. Community-controlled and counter-institutions should be made into insurgent bases.

Why do we have to be civil on this issue at hand?The left isnt.Oh I know, because were better than that, right? Because someone wants to be on the moral highground, right? Theres a saying in German: Der Klgere gibt nach (the wiser one gives in), and usually its ended with und der Dumme fllt in den Bach (the dumb one falls into the creek), in order to produce a rhyme.Now imagine a world where this would be standard. The wiser, smarter one always gives in.Itd be a world ruled by idiots.No thanks.Im sick of giving in, of being tolerant and whatever other stuff is floating around.Moral highground means jack. Sitting on the high horse of morality means jack.This case is interesting in a few other aspects. The guy went there, opened fire and left the scene, didnt he? Just like that. Nobody opposed him. Nobody was ready to kill him the moment he got his gun out. Apparently because nobody had a gun. Was it a gun free zone where it happened?Imagine somebody there would have been carrying and been trained to properly handle a gun. Yep, Im going there. I dare it.  It could have been prevented. It could have been cut short. But there was nobody in the area to do that. Also, I dont even believe that causation is important. Its simply irrelevant why somebody opens up at unarmed people. Its irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that he did it. Why is unimportant. It was his choice. Case closed.
