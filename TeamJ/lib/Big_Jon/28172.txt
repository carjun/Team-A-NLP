Stupid idea or brilliant solution?   In the past few days I mentioned a solution for the problem of a sexually active culture and the inevitability of children resulting from all of this sex.  But I'm not too sure if it's really as good of an idea as I want to think it could be.  So I would like your collective opinion. First let me explain the problem.  Actually, second... First let me ask everyone to remain civil.  Anyone insulting anyone else will be reported.  And this includes the OP itself.  Anyone ridiculing my idea is going to get reported. Okay. Now the problem... It refers to the numbers of unintended pregnancies and the inevitable abortions that occur as a result.  Now I do not want to get into another abortion debate.  So let's keep that out of this thread.  Let's discuss my plan.  Okay.  Obviously if you NEED to have sex, use the best contraceptive you can.  Use multiple forms of contraceptives.  But contraceptives surprisingly do not solve the problems that come with sex. Maybe for (most) individuals.  But they do not solve the problem for society.  Contraceptives are not 100% effective and when you combine the high efficacies of contraceptives with the sheer volume of sex occurring in the US we are still going to have a LOT of unexpected pregnancies.  Every year almost 2.5 million women use contraceptives, and still get pregnant... in the US alone.  So the apparent solution seems to be abortion.  Well, at over a million abortions a year, I'm not too happy with that solution.  There's got to be a better one. Well, my ideal solution is for society to get its act together and recognize that safe sex is a myth and they need to control their freaking urges.  Well, I'm told this is unreasonable and I need to shut up about it. So I have a different solution.  Hopefully it's something even pro-choicers can get behind.  I think they might, if my math adds up. In the course of this discussion, can someone please check my math on this?  Something doesn't seem right.  I've got to be missing something with regards to this apparently (to me) brilliant solution to the problem of a liberal sexually active culture, pregnancy, and abortion. Okay, I thought this up because I argue with pro-choicers.  I hate it but they seem to love it.  They also loooooooove to tell me that if I care so much about the babies then I should step up and adopt some myself.  But I'm thinking, "I'm not the one having so much sex.   Why should I be punished?  If anyone should take care of the babies it should be all of the millions of people who are having all of this casual sex that is creating all of these babies in the first place."  And it dawned on me.  Isn't that what insurance is for? So, my solution is pregnancy insurance.  If a woman (or perhaps a man) wants to have a sexually active lifestyle, she (or he) takes out this insurance.  Contraceptives for her (and him) would be free.  If she gets pregnant, the child's medical, food and housing expenses would be taken care of until it is 18.  I know.  Ridiculous, right?  Well... maybe not.  Read on.  The ridiculousness gets better.  Also, if the child is born with a birth defect or a handicap, its expenses would be taken care of for life (depending on the severity of the condition.)  "Wow.  That's crazy Alex."  I know it is. That's why I'm asking you smart people for your opinion.  If the woman is raped she is given free counseling until she is ready to stop and she might be given incentives to keep the baby instead of abort it. (Although I understand that it could still be very hard for her to keep it.) Oh and of course the woman's medical expenses during the pregnancy and shortly afterwards would be taken care of too. Because financial hardship appears to be a large reason for so many abortions this would definitely decrease the numbers of abortions. So while it's popular to tell pro-lifers that we should bear the burden for the rest of society's sexually active lifestyle, this would move the burden to the people who are actually having the sex that leads to the "necessity" for abortion. And it would ensure the children would be cared for instead of aborted. Of course pregnancy insurance is quite likely to affect the world in a similar manner that contraceptives did. People would probably have sex more often. So I'm not 100% sold on it. But it's something to think about.   Okay.  So I did some VERY rough calculations.  A lot is based on guesswork and a quick website search. It is said (from my limited research) that the average cost of a child from birth to 18 averages at around $250,000.  We should be able to look at contraceptive statistics and make a reasonable educated guess about how much this would cost. So the cost of each child must be carried by all of the policy-holders. Implanon is the most effective form of birth control (more effective than sterilization) and is fairly easily monitored.  It's an implant so it's easy to use. The woman doesn't have to think about taking a pill or have a condom.  And it's not dependent on "proper use" like a condom or pill.  She just goes to the doctor every 5 years or whatever to get a new implant. An IUD would also be another option, although it's less effective and is more prone to complications.  So let's assume implanon would be a requirement. At 99.8% effective, 2 out of every 1000 women will become pregnant each year while using this contraceptive.  So...  Roughly, what would the premiums need to be?  250,000 * 2 children / 1000 = $500 a year.  $500 / 12 = $41.67 a month per policy-holder. EDIT:  Okay.. I was a bit disappointed by the 41.67 a month figure.  But then I realized that if the men get onto birth control, then the numbers will drop significantly.  If men are encouraged to get on a 99% effective birth control, then the numbers will divide by 100!!! That means the premiums will drop to $0.42 a MONTH!  FORTY TWO CENTS A MONTH!!!!(Any hitchhiker fans?  Coincidence?  I think not.  Did I stumble on the question?) This is where I need someone to check my math.  Surely I'm missing something. Of course this discounts the incidences of handicapped children and the medical expenses of the mother, especially if there are complications with the pregnancy.  And of course it doesn't include the cost of the contraceptive.  But cheese.  If an insurance company made this available for $20 a month it would be affordable to a large number of people and I'm sure it would work financially for the insurance companies and I think it would have an impact on the numbers of abortions.  It could also be provided as a benefit alongside medical insurance from employers. So.  What's the downside?  I think it will encourage MORE sex.  But the financial consequences of all of that sex will be balanced out by the premiums.  So the money isn't the issue.  The numbers of people would be.  Population will increase.  Birth rates will increase.  And that's not good.  On the other hand, the numbers of women using the most effective form of birth control would increase.  And that might cause the number of conceptions to DECREASE.  So maybe this issue would be a wash, except for the increase in sex.  And even that idea is debatable. Of course there is the possibility that some women might attempt to abuse the system.  But if they get an implant, then how can they? It was already raised that people who want to get pregnant will sign up and have their baby and get all of the expenses paid for.  Well, they aren't likely to get the baby if they are using implanon, are they?  Really, the requirements of this system would make it difficult to abuse it. Any other problems? EDIT:  Nullified if men are encouraged to get on board too.Obviously not every person can afford $100 a month.  Well, what if guys contribute too?  Now we are getting into a bit of a delicate area.  He would need to be on a contraceptive too.  I don't think there is one for men as effective as implanon.  The closest is a vasectomy.  I doubt surgery would be a feasible requirement.  Also, what if an insured woman has sex with an uninsured man and becomes pregnant?  Does the insurance company pay just half of the expenses?  I guess so.  But half is better than none.  But would that encourage the woman to keep the baby or would she still be likely to abort?  On the other hand, if a highly effective form of birth control is made available to the men, then the incidences of pregnancy will drop BELOW 2 for every 1000.  So the premiums should reflect that.  Who knows?  Maybe the premiums could be as low as $30 a month.  Maybe even $20.  I know a male form of birth control pill is on the horizon.  But it's dependent on the man actually taking the pill.  Still, I think it's a question worth considering. Even if the numbers are able to get down to $50 a month even that might be too much for some women.  Employers might provide some assistance there, but what about employers that don't normally offer health insurance?  Would this system target the middle class and up?  Maybe.  Certainly people in poverty wouldn't be able to afford it.  And they are the most at risk for getting pregnant and having abortions.  Anything else?  Any other difficulties? Remember.  Please, let's keep this discussion civil.  This isn't an abortion thread.  It's not a contraceptive thread.  It's a discussion about the feasibility of my idea.  Let's stick to that.  And once again.  Be civil. Anyone ridiculing my idea is going to get reported. Thanks. (And BTW... sorry this OP was so danged long.)

Who would pay the premiums for teenagers? Even 12 and 13 year olds. Why would someone with the implant want to pay a premium if they knew they were "safe"? $40-50-100 per month is nothing to sneeze at. There are people with children that won't even pay that much to have decent life insurance, even though their kids could be left destitute. Everyday, homes burn down and people are left homeless because they didn't have insurance. BUT, they had big screen TV's, cable TV, computers, high speed internet etc. Sadly, people as a whole, can be very irresponsible in all aspects of their lives. It just wouldn't work. I would like a requirement that if you are living on welfare, after child number two, you will no longer receive an increase in benefits for #3, unless you voluntarily use Implanon. We need to take away the incentive of more benefits for more children somehow. OK.........here it is.

Sure.  They are the people who have to deal with the pregnancy.  But I think the insurance should be encouraged for men too.  Think about it.  If you are a guy trying to get laid, being able to show a pregnancy insurance card... well, it might not be the most romantic, but it would certainly help.  See, the idea is that as a requirement for coverage you have to be on a form of birth control that can be controlled.  That's why implanon is so good for this.  If there is something like that for men, then it would significantly reduce the occurrences of pregnancy.  I mean significantly.  If the guy's contraceptive is just 99% effective 2/1000 would go down to 2/100,000.  Then the cost for the two children would be $5 a year instead of $500 a year.  So I think it would be GREAT to get guys to pay a $10 a month insurance premium to encourage them to do it.  Get them on a highly effective form of birth control and the women will benefit greatly. Their premiums will drop from $100 a month to $10 to $20 a month.   Quote:   Who would pay the premiums for teenagers? Even 12 and 13 year olds.   Obviously the parents.   Quote:   Why would someone with the implant want to pay a premium if they knew they were "safe"?   Because they aren't really safe.  But this is a good question.  Probably your best argument.  But I think the responsibility and smartness inherent in this insurance would help a lot.  A good advertising campaign would be necessary.  Maybe there could be some health insurance benefits too.  Definitely give some incentives.  If the cost per child is dropped to $2.50 a year then it would be very easy to pay for some additional benefits.   Quote:   $40-50-100 per month is nothing to sneeze at. There are people with children that won't even pay that much to have decent life insurance, even though their kids could be left destitute.   See above with getting guys to use contraceptives too.   Quote:   Everyday, homes burn down and people are left homeless because they didn't have insurance.

But we can't do anything about stupid people.  They'll continue to do stupid things.  All we can do is try to help the smart people best we can.   Quote:   It just wouldn't work.   I'm really not sure that's true.  I originally miscalculated, thinking the cost per woman would be $500 for 18 years.  Then I realized that there would be 2 children born each year.  So I was kind of disappointed.  Then I realized that if men use contraceptives too, then the efficacy would stack and the numbers would drop significantly to 1/5000.  Quote:   I would like a requirement that if you are living on welfare, after child number two, you will no longer receive an increase in benefits for #3, unless you voluntarily use Implanon. We need to take away the incentive of more benefits for more children somehow.   Oh no, it would be a requirement to be on implanon to be insured at all! Really, I think the best thing about this plan is it would get all of these people on the most effective form of birth control available.  You want contraceptives to solve the problems of abortion?  Well, the best way to make use of that is to get everyone on as good of a contraceptive as possible. And when you combine methods, you get much closer to 100%.

I would think most men would flock to get it. They would no longer have to worry about paying child support for a kid they didn't even want. Perhaps if the pro-life crowd put the money they waste trying to overturn Roe V Wade, into research to come up with an Implanon-like option for men instead............such an option could be available guickly. Such an option would drastically reduce the amount of abortions performed overnight.   Now, the economics of a woman having to pay, let's say $50 per month for pregnancy insurance. Let's say a woman pays $50 per month from the age of 18 to 50. That's 32 years at $600 per year, that's $19,200 over their reproductive lifetime. The cost of an abortion, let's say $500......and most women never have one, let alone two.......pretty bad return on money that could have been invested in an IRA instead.......and would be worth MUCH more than the original $19,200. Those are the calculations I would make, then I would respectfully decline the insurance.  Once again, women are being severely penalized and the men get off scott free. As a woman.......I would never go for it. And...........don't know anything about Implanon.........but is it even safe after the age of 35, much like the pill? Diabetics, etc.?

If men are involved, and if their effective birth control is 99% the woman's premium would be ONE PERCENT of that 41.67! The premium would be 41.67 / 100 / 2 (because the man is splitting the cost.)  What's that?  21 cents a month!!!!!   So BOTH sexes pay $10 a month or $20 a month.  All's fair and equal.   Quote:   And...........don't know anything about Implanon.........but is it even safe after the age of 35, much like the pill? Diabetics, etc.?   I don't know.  Perhaps if it isn't safe for certain people then they could use an alternative contraceptive and pay a higher premium.

And the average cost of raising children has gone up way more than that, if you include college education and incidental stuff like spending money, trips, toys, etc..
