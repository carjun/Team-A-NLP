He seems to have various interests. He is relatively young and most likely doesn't have any deep roots in any political movement. He could be left, right, libertarian, independent, conservative, conspiratorial or a combination of any of them. None of that matters as much as his state of mind. I agree that he may have been inspired by someone he heard, or something he read or even something he perceived. I don't think it is wise to label mentally ill people by any political affiliation. It may be very difficult to prove that he was politically motivated if he is mentally ill.

However that does not exonerate the right for their hate speech and subtle and sometimes not so subtle incitement to violence.  Someone who is mentally ill would be much more susceptible to that than a mentally healthy person.This is the type of crime that is either done by someone who is very mentally ill or someone who is a total fanatic.

Which is why leaders of the Republican party shouldn't constantly refer to "armed and dangerous take over of the government" or post hit lists using a rifle site to make their points.  Unhinged people tend to take this dangerous rhetoric seriously.Whether the guy is Republican or not DOES NOT in any way excuse their dangerous and inciteful rhetoric.  Did this guy take Palin's web post seriously?  We don't know yet, but I guarantee he didn't get the idea of killing anyone from Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi or any other Democrat because they have never made such incidious comments.  But many Republicans have on numerous occasions.

When one uses political rhetoric that places all things in the most dire of terms, "death panels" as opposed to "end of life care counselors", the "end of freedom and capitalism" as opposed to "health insurance reform", sooner or later some portion of the unbalanced will used these concepts to rationalize aggressive actions.How many mailed packages to government agencies and political figures mysteriously caught on fire last week?  My count has 4 letter bomb like incendiary packages reported in the mail last week, before this event.  I don't know if more existed but just went unreported nationally.  Is there a connection between these events?  Probably not, with the noted exception that a congress not controlled by Teahadists convened this week.   They did not "take the country back" at the ballot box.....Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptnvoter      (37 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 08:36 AMResponse to Original message104.if the victim was a Republican who had received death threats from the leftrightwingers would have no issue with blaming the left.There are far too many coincidences.

The right must admit to their own crazies.  Anythingless won't accomplish anything.  Say what you want.  Facts are facts.

Instead of waiting for the actual facts to be determined, too many people are eagerly and excitedly attempting to win a few media cycles by assigning this person to either the right or left.You can already sense the deflation and disappointment from many on DU that this kid appears to have just been plain old crazy instead of a crazy Teabagger or rightwinger.  So now that the "Laughner was a teabagger" thing doesn't seem to be working out, we are now on the "well, it doesn't matter that he wasn't an actual teabagger because their rhetoric caused it either way".  I am sure right wing sites are busy trying to find "evidence" that Jared was some left winger so they can blame us.  There have been other examples of this.This has played several times.  I remember when that crazy dude flew his plane into the IRS building.  So many people on DU were racing to call him a rightwing teabagger - that is, until his manifesto was fully digested and it became pretty clear that he was no teabagger.  Then there was the letter carrier who was found hung - the attempts here on DU to assign that death to "right wing anti government rhetoric" fell completely apart once it was determined the guy committed suicide.If this guy is a teabagger or had right win sympathies, it will all come out in time.  It is pretty vile to try to affix blame until we actually know the facts.  IF, and that is a big IF, the evidence shows that Jared killed because of right wing rhetoric, some good might come of this - perhaps it will cause the likes of Beck and Limbaugh to dial back their hateful rhetoric.  As of right now though, there doesn't seem to be much evidence connecting this kid to the right or left.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopEmpowerer      (802 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:05 PMResponse to Reply #108116.THANK you!Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPeace4us      (44 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 01:17 PMResponse to Reply #108125.The Right Wing Says He's Left WingThey are also politicizing it.http://hillbuzz.org/2011/01/08/my-congresswoman-voted-a...

The target was a Democrat in a crowd of people who were most likely Democrats. The GOP and TPM has been spreading dangerous, hateful rhetoric for the past 2 years. This isn't a courtroom, we don't need evidence. Call it hope if you want, but I prefer to think this is the result of RW rhetoric instead of some troubled soul that bypassed every possible target to gun down a guarded member of Congress, a judge and 12 others including a 9 year old girl.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopWiffenPoof      (292 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:33 PMResponse to Original message117.Yep...You Are Absolutely Correct      n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topbemildred      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:42 PMResponse to Original message118.You're damn well right I am.And the connection fucking well does exist.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHeroTwins      (22 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:47 PMResponse to Original message121.I think there may be some folks here really hoping this guy can't be tied to the GOPPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLiberal_Stalwart71      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 01:10 PMResponse to Original message124.So, does this mean that the Sheriff who condemned hateful rhetoric againstEdited on Sun Jan-09-11 01:10 PM by Liberal_Stalwart71government, hate radio and T.V., is "jumping to conclusions" without facts? He spoke of bigotry and prejudice in Arizona. Is he jumping to conclusions?He seems to suggest that this guy is most definitely a wingnut, for I've never heard a true liberal rail against the evils of government, carrying Ayn Rand books in arm. Have you?In addition, if Palin felt so non-responsible, then why the rush to scrub her page of any reference to violence, implied or explicit, directed at Democrats?Finally, when Giffords' father was asked who his daughter's enemies were, he replied emphatically--without the slightest hesitation--"the entire Tea Party."http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/136787... Gabrielle Giffords herself said that the Tea Party has essentially set up shop outside her district office.It's time to get your head out of the sand.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopIDemo      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 01:21 PMResponse to Original message126.I think there are a great number of wingers who are mentally unstable,whether or not they act out their fantasies.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLWolf      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 01:40 PMResponse to Original message128."Troubled soul" and tied to the Tea Party may just go hand in hand.  ntPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topemilyg      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 02:03 PMResponse to Original message129.K/rPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHansel      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:06 PMResponse to Original message133.It doesn't have to be "either or".There is a definite connection between being a troubled followers of the extreme right and the efforts to incite these people by right wing groups and media, and members of the GOP political establishment.  This was a predictable result.  There really isn't any need to force the connection.  It's fairly clear at this point.There was actually mainstream media person who surmised this morning that the guy might not even know who Sarah Palin is.  That is an extreme effort to force a disconnection.
