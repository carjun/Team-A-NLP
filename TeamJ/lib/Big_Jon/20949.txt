Bush2 didn't happen in a vacuum.How many of you even know that a good deal of the money Bill's collected since he left office has come through those protected on BCCI matters - Stephens, Marc Rich, Dubai and Saudi royals, to name a few.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topclarence swinney      (673 posts)Thu Dec-04-08 12:56 PMResponse to Reply #3954.CLINTON WON AMERICA WONCLINTON PRAISE--WITH PLEASUREGDP--rose from 6300 to11,600NATIONAL INCOME-5,000 to 8,0000 Billion--took 20 years to grow 2500B beforeClintonJOBS CREATED--over 22 million--record by farAVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS--$360 to $478AVERAGE WEEKLY HOURS WORKED--never hit 35.0--hit that  mark 4 times in 80'sUNEMPLOYMENT--from 7.2% down down down to 3.9%MINIMUM WAGE--$4.25 to $5.15MINORITIES--did exceedingly wellHOME OWNERSHIP--hit all time highDEFICIT--290 Billion to whoopee a SURPLUSDEBT----+28%---300% increase over prior12 yearsFEDERAL SPENDING--+28%---80% under Reagan- who da true conservative?DOW JONES AVERAGE--3,500 to 11,800  all it's history to get to 3500 and Clinton zooms it NASDAQ--700 to 5,000---all of it's history to get to 700 and Clinton zooms itVALUES INDEXES-- almost all bad went down--good went up in zoom zoom zoomFOREIGN AFFAIRS--Peace on Earth good will toward each other---Mark of a true Christian--what has Bush done to Peace on Earth?POPULARITY---highest poll ratings  in history during peacetime in  AFRICA, ASIA AND EUROPE even 98.5% in Moscow--left office with highest gallup rating since it was started in 1920's.STAND UP FOR JUSTICE--evil conservatives spent $110,000,000 on hearings and investigations and caught one very evil man who took a few plane rides to events.BOW YOUR HEADS--Thank you God for sending us a man of Bill Clinton's character, intelligence, knowledge of governance, ability to face up to crises without whimpering and a great leader of the world.THANK YOU GOD FOR THE GOOD TIMES THE CLINTON YEARS.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topblm      (1000+ posts)Mon Jan-12-09 12:30 PMResponse to Reply #5455.Overturned within 1yr of BushInc because BILL PROTECTED GHWBush and Jackson Stephens.9-11 was a direct result of protecting BushInc from BCCI matters - you want to APPLUD THAT, clarence?

Robert Reich - Briliant economist, reasoned, respected and usually correct in his assessments.2. Jimmy Carter - The epitome of fair and balanced.3. Howard Dean - The voice of the People.

Try answering that question honestly.Daschle, Durbin and Kerry tapped their political organizations to face down the Clinton machine once and for all and Obama was the candidate they backed.Subtract the Clinton loyalists who are the biggest assholes and undermining campaign saboteurs in the Dem party in 2000, 2002 and 2004, and the actual political organization Kerry had was topnotch.BTW - You think Axelrod would be YOUR strategist of choice in 2002 and 2004 elections?  Axelrod was the Dem strategist advising Dem candidates then to NOT bring up Iraq war on the campaign  trail, and to stick to domestic issues. He publicly criticized Kerry in 2002 for attacking Bush on Iraq.Then he came out as Edwards' campaign guru shortly after Edwards helped write the IWR bill.No election is the same.So - let's deal with the FACTS as they exist. The media perception that some of you latch on to shows how easily you can be manipulated by those with control of the broadcast airwaves.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topdavidpdx      (1000+ posts)Sat Jun-14-08 03:56 AMResponse to Original message40.My list1) Joe "neocon" Lieberman2) James "traitor" Carville2) Bill and Hillary Clinton3) Ed "the hack" Rendell4) Terry "I'll eat my own shit for breakfast if it's cooked right" McAuliffe5) Elliot "I have a hardon" Spitzer6) Geraldine "the racist" Ferraro 7) Mark "the mouth" Penn8) Howard "I can't take it any more so I'll whine" Wolfson9) Tom "idiot ranter" Buffenbarger (see link below)http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/23255540#232555... 10) Bob "I'll kiss Hillary's ass any day of the week" ShrumPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHand Man      (2 posts)Mon Jul-07-08 10:48 AMResponse to Reply #4041.Agreed.Seconding Mark Penn.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopKarl_Bonner_1982      (701 posts)Sun Aug-10-08 06:47 AMResponse to Original message42.Alan Greenspan!

I'm very interested to see what the true lip service percentages end up being for both sides of this autocracy election. For all those who just love to speak in absolutes, open your eyes , and your heart, and your mind.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopAh Xoc Kin      (143 posts)Fri Oct-03-08 01:18 PMResponse to Original message48.Matt Drudge Drudgereport.comDrudgereport.com is very right wing the headline while I'm typing this is a giantSarah Palin photo with caption "The Sarah Show"Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopBlackButterfly6      (8 posts)Mon Oct-20-08 03:25 PMResponse to Original message49.

She has been great lately, so...It's funny that Carville's on the list because he sure has been biased lately. Russert is no longer with us...I would add Terry McAuliffe but he's been MIA since Hillary's loss.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopChan790      (1000+ posts)      Fri Oct-31-08 11:14 PMResponse to Original message53.What's interesting...is that many (if not all) of those people listen to one man...a guy that most people have not ever heard of...a scum-sucking corporatist quisling named Al From. Al From is the founder and CEO of the Democratic Leadership Council. He's as lily-livered and yellow-bellied as he is black-hearted...there is no Democratic constituency he won't sell down the river to forward his socially-regressive Freedman-style economically-conservative corporatist agenda.Ronald Reagan famously said that he didn't leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left him. Al From should realize the same thing. It is good and necessary from time-to-time for this party to cut dead weight and anchors for the good of the Democratic Party. If we didn't, we'd still be the party of Billy Tauzin and Strom Thurmond and Ronald Reagan and Joe Lieberman.You don't need a list of ten people...you only need a list of one person: Al From.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topvotervoice      (3 posts)Tue Jan-27-09 04:09 PMResponse to Original message56.How about adding the Communist Party to the list?Democrats better watch out for the Communists now lurking within the party.

He is progressive and embodies all of the kinds of things that we really need in our community.  Can anybody help with an idea of how to raise some funds to help him run?  He has a website that lets you donate online at http://electbriangrim.com/contribute.htm  but I was thinking if there was a way to get a bunch of people to just donate like $10.00 it would be really helpful.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 11:03 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss Topic ForumsDemocratsPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
