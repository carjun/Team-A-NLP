'Sylvia' is looking for a special home!  Click on her picture to see and read more.Special Needs Cats                                    at CCHS We currently have two very special cats at CCHS, and they are looking for some special homes.                                    If you have just the right home with lots of love to share, we may have the perfect match for you! Read on....  "Sylvia" showed up                                    at the home of one of our volunteers. Much to everyone's surprise, Sylvia started having kittens. We rushed                                    Sylvia to a foster home, where she proceeded to have 11 kittens. It was a big family, but Sylvia was a good mom. Sadly,                                    Sylvia tested positive for Feline Leukemia when we did her blood test. (Thankfully, her kittens tested negative.)                                    Please click here to see more  pictures of Sylvia and read more about FIV. Sylvia is a very                                    sweet girl. She was pretty scared when she first came to us, but her foster family really helped her to learn to trust                                    people. Sylvia is now 2 1/2 years old and is a spayed female. She's also polydactyl and has extra toes on                                    each of her feet. She just loves attention and being petted. She has a gorgeous long-haired coat that's very soft.                                    She is a playful girl and would love to get more exercise and playtime than she does now, as she's staying in the Isolation                                    Ward at the Shelter. She's very hopeful to find the wonderful new home she's looking for! UPDATE: Sylvia has been adopted to a wonderful                                    new home! We're all so very happy for her!!'Valerie' is looking for someone special to love!  Click on her picture to see and read more!   "Valerie" came to us as a stray. She was in rather tough shape. She was dirty, skinny                                    and bedraggled, with her beautiful coat a mess. We don't know what her background is, and she can't tell us.                                    We do know that her wonderful personality is just outstanding! Valerie is about 3 1/2 years old and is a spayed female.                                    Valerie's only problem is that she tested positive for FIV, or Feline Immunodeficiency Virus. Please click here to see more pictures of Valerie and read more about FIV. Valerie did have a rough time when she was out on her own, as she also suffered an injury to her spine and tail.                                    It doesn't cause her any pain or discomfort, but she can't raise her beautiful tail like most kitties. Valerie                                    has done well since being at the Shelter, and her coat is now thick and soft. She's gained weight, and just loves                                    all the attention she can get. She's living is our Isolation Ward now, so she's definitely anxious to find a                                    new home of her own.   Both Valeria and Sylvia are very healthy cats, showing no symptoms or complications from their diseases.                                    Both have beautiful soft, fluffy coats, and both have the sweetest personalities ever. Given the proper care, each can                                    live a long, normal life. Neither FIV or FeLV can be transmitted to people, dogs, or animals (other than cats).                                    The only absolute requirement is that they be the only cat in their new home (or live with other similarly positive cats)                                    and they can never be outside. We simply would never want to put any other cats at risk.If                                    you are looking for a fabulous new friend and have just the right home, please consider Valerie or Sylvia for your family.                                    Each has an enormous amount of love to share in their heart, they just need to find the right person to share it with!Governor Signs AB250!Governor Doyle signs AB-250 into law!On Tuesday, December 1st, Governor Doyle signed AB-250, the Commercial Dog Breeders Licensure Bill                                    into Law. What a wonderful day for dogs in Wisconsin!! We are so proud to have been part of the incredible effort                                    that went into making this happen! We thank everyone who worked so hard and for so long. This history-making law                                    is going to make a huge difference in the lives of dogs in Wisconsin puppy mills. There will be an 18-month period before                                    the law actually takes effect, during which time the Administrative Rules will be written. These rules will provide                                    the specifices for the enforcement of the new law. We know that there are many, many dogs in puppy mills now who                                    will be needing our help in the future. We will continue to do everything we can to make a difference!AB-250 will make a difference in the lives of puppy mill dogs.Cheri & Chuck Wegner from CCHS with Governor Jim DoyleCCHS staff with FVHA Director Deb Lewis, Senator Kreitlow, Rep Smith, & WPMP Director Eilene RibbensANIMALS RESCUED IN WISCONSIN!The following press release comes from HSUS,who in conjunction with ASPCA, American Humane Association                                    and United AnimalNations, seized 190 animals from inhumane conditions at Thyme & SageRanch inCazenovia,                                    Wisconsin. Clark County Humane Society played an important role in laying the groundwork for the investigation that                                    led to thismassive rescue. While saddened by the situation, we are pleased to haveplayed an instrumental                                    part in bringing thistragic case to light. We are proud of our colleagues at Dane County Humane Society                                    and applaud their efforts to help these animals in need. We have offered to assist DCHS in any way that we can.More details will be made public through newspaper, television and radio in the ensuing next few days.Once again,                                    the newly finished rescue room at our Shelter will be put to good use.Animalsfrom the Thyme &Sage                                    rescueare at our Shelternow. The conditions these poor animals have suffered inpoint out again why                                    it is so very important that Wisconsinlegislators pass the bills (AB-250 and SB-208) currently workingtheir way                                    through the legislative process. IfWisconsin had that legislation in place previously, this entire situationcould                                    have been avoided and hundreds of animals would not have suffered in the name of profit and greed.PRESS RELEASE: FOR IMMEDIATE                                    RELEASEMore than 190 Animals Rescued from Appalling Conditions                                    in Cazenovia Cruelty CaseAnimal Welfare Groups Come Together to Aid Neglected AnimalsCAZENOVIA, Wis.                                    (May 19, 2009) - More than 190 animals - including dogs, horses, fowl, livestock and other small animals have been seized                                    by the Richland County Sherriff's Department from the Thyme and Sage Ranch in Cazenovia, Wis. Members of the Richland                                    County Sheriff's department served a search warrant at the property this morning along with responders from local and                                    national animal welfare organizations including The Humane Society of the United States.The rescue was set into                                    motion by investigators with The HSUS who received numerous tips about cruel conditions and neglected animals in need of veterinary                                    care and who, in conjunction with the Dane County Humane Society, presented evidence to the Richland County District Attorney's                                    office. The Richland County District Attorney also requested assistance from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty                                    to Animals (ASPCA) to oversee evidence gathering and forensics. Other participating agencies include the American Humane Association,                                    providing assistance with animal handling and United Animal Nations, providing sheltering assistance. Dane County Humane Society                                    is acting as the lead local animal agency, and has called upon the Wisconsin Federated Humane Societies to provide support.                                    Much-needed supplies were provided by PetSmart Charities, which sent its Emergency Relief Waggin' full                                    of donated goods such as wire crates, dog food and medical supplies.When rescuers arrived at the property, they                                    were greeted by a disturbing scene. Breeds ranged from Scottish Terriers to Labrador mixes, some                                    were suffering from serious medical ailments and housed in poor conditions. Some of the dogs had severely matted fur and serious                                    skin infections. They were being housed in feces-ridden, unheated barns and outdoor structures.The ASPCA is evaluating all animals found at the site and collecting evidence for the prosecution                                    of the criminal case, as well as lending the services of its special forensic cruelty investigation team, comprised of disaster                                    animal rescuers and field service investigators. More than a dozen ASPCA animal responders are also on site, along with the                                    ASPCA's "Mobile Animal Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) Unit," a critical tool in the collection and processing                                    of evidence and which brings both state-of-the-art forensics tools and unmatched expertise to crime scenes.Rescuers                                    are in the process of removing all of the animals and transporting them to a nearby emergency shelter set up by The HSUS and                                    UAN at Dane County Humane Society. Once at the shelter, the dogs will be checked by a team of veterinarians and given                                    any necessary immediate medical care.Any member of the public who believes their lost pet may have been currently                                    held at the Cazenovia facility should submit their information to giveshelter.org <http://www.giveshelter.org/sitemgr/> .

About thirty hardy souls joined us to continue our message that puppy mills and dog auctions are just                                    wrong! We most certainly appreciate the efforts of everyone who participated in our protest, and we hope that they've                                    all thawed out by now! We were very pleased to have Channel 18,WQOW,cover the event. Wewere                                    also very excited to have Representative Jeff Smith at the protest. Rep. Smith addressed the group of protestors and                                    rescuers prior to the auction, sharing informationabout possible legislation that he is working on and hopes to introduce                                    soon.One of the rescue groups visits CCHS after the auction, bringing several dogs to stay at CCHS.There were 236 dogs sold at the dog auction.There                                    were many buyers atthe auction, including other puppy millers and breeders. In addition, a number of rescue                                    groups attended the auction with the purpose of savingas many dogs as they could. While the policy of CCHS is                                    that we do not purchase dogs at the auction, we are willing to helpany dogs that need assistance after the auction.                                    As a result, we received 24 dogs that had been purchased by rescue groups or individuals at theauction. The rescues                                    know that we willdo everything possible to help the dogs, both medically and socially, and so gave the dogs to us to                                    care for and rehome. We are delighted that we are able to assist in this manner.Two Cocker Spaniels, rescued from the auction, would like to find a foster home together.Wenow have lots of dogs at the Shelter! Our new rescue                                    room, built specifically for this type of situation, is full!! The 24 dogs that we received are all doing well.                                    They have all been vet-checked and bloodwork has been sent to the lab to test for brucellosis. We should have all results                                    back shortly. Westarted to spay/neuter the dogs onTuesday. We are thrilled that several of the dogs                                    have made wonderful progress and will be available for adoption shortly. Sadly,other dogs in the groupare                                    not quite as social and have more issues. As expected with puppy mill survivors, they simply aren't used to the                                    human touch and are pretty scared. They need to learn that peoplewon't always hurt them and that they can                                    be their friends.Wewould like to invite everyone to come to the Shelter to meet                                    our rescue dogs and spend time with them. Socialization is critical to their progress, and we love having people hold                                    the dogs, talk to them, and walk themoutside. Each day they are getting a little bit better, but it takes lotsof                                    time and patience. In addition, we are placing the dogs most in need into foster homes. They simply require more                                    intense attention than we can provide at theShelter. If you're interested in providing foster care, please                                    let us know. You can submit a foster care application through the foster care tab on the left side menu of this website.We are also in need of donations and supplies to help care for all of the dogs.We especially need papertowels,                                    soft doggie treats, bleachand pinesol. Monetary donations are also most welcome as we are incurring expenses for                                    medical care beyond our normal budget.Please come and see our rescue dogs at the Shelter! They are                                    sure to touch your heart, and we know thatwe can help them to have a happyfuture!PLEASE HELP US!!Everyone at CCHS is so excited about our building project!                                    Construction on our new addition started on June 17th. Wonderful progress has been made, but we need your help to keep                                    going. As can happen with major projects, our expenses have exceeded our expectations. First we learned that our                                    septic system had failed and needed to be completely replaced. Then we learned last Friday that the roof on our original                                    building needed to be replaced. Ouch!! We very much wish to complete the project, but right now that is in jeopardy.                                    But that is where you can help! We desperately need donations to keep going. We are a non-profit charity and are                                    privately funded. We do not receive any government funding. All of our support comes from our members and friends.                                    All donations made to CCHS are fully tax-deductible to the full extent allowed by law.

Oh My Goodness, Were In Trouble                                    Now! by Chuck Wegner, Shelter ManagerWell, we were afraid this might happen and it has. Our construction project has come to a                                    screeching halt. I mean completely stopped, dead in its tracks. As of Monday, October 13, all workers had to be                                    notified that we could no longer pay them so it wasn't fair to have them keep working on the project.You cant                                    imagine how difficult a decision that was for me. We have saved for 10 years to do the addition and I thought we had it all                                    covered. Instead, the price of copper has soared while the economy has plunged and so have donations to charities like us.                                    Animal-related charities are being especially hard hit. I can understand that in a way. Obviously people have to come first.                                    I am a true friend to the animals but I do realize that when you come right down to it, people must be considered first. That                                    being said, I think there is still a need to keep shelters, like ours, running so that we can be there to help the animals                                    that need us too.The real sad part                                    of this whole thing is that we were so close to being able to use the addition I can almost feel it. The exterior is just                                    about finished. The heating/cooling system is half finished and if nothing else, we really need to get the heat system up                                    and running in order to preserve the concrete slab from cracking in the winter cold. The fact that we had to put in a whole new septic system and re-roof the old part                                    of the Shelter is what killed the project. We had the addition expenses covered until those two major unexpected items drained                                    the funds. Both of them had to be done in order for the project to proceed and now its stalled out because the funds                                    are used up.So, here we sit. Winter                                    is fast approaching and we cant finish the project up. We had budgeted and saved up $200,000 and the project will need                                    an extra $100,000 to finish. It seems like a lot because it is. When you see the building and realize its potential to help                                    countless numbers of homeless, helpless pets though, you will understand why we are so disappointed in not being able to finish                                    off the rest of it. Were so close, but so is winter.If you would like to see what were trying to do in person, please call us at 715 743-4550 between Noon and 3 PM on Mon, Wed, Fri or Sat and talk to me about it. Better yet, stop in during those same times to                                    get a tour of the construction so far. I will be more than glad to share our excitement about the addition with you. I will                                    also share my frustration at not being able to finish it.I know these are tough and scary economic times but I am hoping that somewhere out there, people will read this and                                    offer to help us get the addition finished up. I have faith it will happen, somehow, someway. Let me know if its you                                    that can help.We're Back                                    On e-Bay!!!We are very glad to announce that CCHS is back to selling lots of items on e-Bay.

DOG AUCTION PROTEST IS A HUGE SUCCESS!!Click on Photo above to see more Protest Pictures!!Pictures and StoriesClick here to view pictures and stories from the Dog Auction Protest. There will be more photos and stories posted in                                       the next few days, so please keep checking back. New videos and photos of the auction now posted!! (Last update 10/3/07)Thank you!The Dog Auction Protest on Saturday, September                                    22, was a huge success!! We had over 100 people in attendance!! We would like to thank                                    everyone that helped with this event. We are so pleased that we had such a great showing of support. We                                    really feel that we were able to make a public statement that dog auctions and puppy mills are just wrong. We                                    had people in attendance from all over Wisconsin                                    and Minnesota, and from as far away as North Dakota!                                    We also had fantastic coverage from the media, including 5 TV stations. If we did not get a chance                                    to thank you personally for being there on Saturday, please know that we are grateful and we truly appreciate your help.                                    A protest such as this does not happen without each and every person there. An individual may have                                    a hard time making a difference, but as a group, we know that we can!! As Chuck Wegner, CCHS Executive                                    Director recently stated, All thats necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to stand silent.                                    We are proud of everyone that stood with us and did not remain silent!Violence EruptsAs is being reported on several TV stations,                                    there was a violent episode at the protest. Lindsey, a young girl who was helping with this protest, was                                    accosted by two members of the general audience after taking a picture. According to Lindsey, she was pushed                                    to the ground and hit with a cane. We also learned that there were two other members of our group attacked                                    by the same individuals. After extensive conversations with the police officers on duty at the protest,                                    we learned that charges could have been brought against the attackers, but charges would also have been brought against us.                                    As the officer told us, Because we were there to protest, take pictures, and interrupt the auction, we were                                    actually the instigators of the attack. In the best interest of those involved, no further action                                    was pursued.We are sorry that this incident marred                                    what was otherwise a peaceful protest. We are happy that Lindsey is OK. We respect the                                    law and we understand what the officers were telling us. We are, however, saddened that the women from                                    the other side were able to hurt our members with no consequences. Send us your Pictures                                    and StoriesIf you                                    have any pictures from that day, or have stories and comments you would like to share, PLEASE email them to us at                                    petshelter@email.com. We would love to add more to our                                    story about the protest!Thank you for taking a stand                                    on this very important issue. Because of you the future for the poor                                    dogs stuck in the milling system may be just a bit brighter                                    today. PUPPY MILLS & DOG AUCTIONS IN CENTRAL WISCONSINThere is a lot to be proud of in Clark County.                                    We are a rural county with many beautiful parks, hiking trails, and natural scenic beauty. There are large forested areas,                                    beaches, rivers, waterfalls and mounds to climb. This is a county with a lot to offer the nature-enthusiast. The outdoor recreational                                    opportunities are boundless.Unfortunately there is an ugly blemish                                    on all of this beauty and that is the fact that Clark County                                    is rapidly becoming known as the puppy mill capital of the state. Right here in the midst of this pastoral setting is one                                    of the most cruel, inhumane industries imaginable. We now have dozens of puppy mills where the object is to crank out as many                                    litters in as short a time as possible. Dogs are often kept in undersized cages or boxes, sometimes for years, and many times                                    the sanitation is deplorable.CCHSwas recentlyinvolvedina puppy mill investigative reportconducted by NBC Affiliate Todays                                    TMJ 4from Milwaukee. NBC Affiliate WGBA-TV 26 from Green Bay has been providing extensive coverage of the puppy                                    mills in Wisconsin. However, in spite of all the publicity, we have come to realize that many people do not really know                                    what a puppy mill is all about. In addition to the expansion of puppy mills in our area, we also have the distinction of Dog Auctions being held in Clark                                    County. Most people have never even heard of a dog auction, and do not have any idea what it is.We wish to take some time and explain exactly what is happening in Wisconsin. We certainly want to explain the                                    puppy mill and dog auction issues, but we also wish to update our members and supporters on how CCHS is involved. Most                                    importantly, we want to let you know what you can do right now to help make a difference. PLEASE CLICK HERE TO GO TO COMPLETE INFORMATION ON PUPPY MILLS, DOG AUCTIONS, AND EFFORTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. We need the support of many, many people to stop what is happening right here in                                    Central Wisconsin. We still wantto be proud of the beautiful rural area where we live. We do not want to                                    be known as the "Puppy Mill Capital" of Wisconsin.

FAVORITE COMMERCIALS!We really enjoy some of the pet commercials we watch on TV, and we'd like to share two of them with you!                                    Pedigree has a wonderful ad about their Shelter program which features many actual Shelter dogs. We commend them for                                    supporting the work of Shelters everywhere. And in case you were wondering, all of the dogs shown in the ad have been                                    adopted to new homes! PetSmart has a wonderful ad featuring "BoBo", one of our favorite toys. You can't help but                                    smile watching that one!To view the ads, you must have Realplayer installed on your computer.Then just click on the picture below, and enjoy!Pedigree Shelter AdPetSmart "BoBo" AdASPCA Ad featuring Sarah McLachlanWe absolutely love this ad. It is very powerful and almost brings us to tears each time we view it. The pets in the ad                                    are real and so are their injuries. We want you all to know that the ad is produced by the ASPCA (the organization that brings                                    us Animal Cops). We feel that they are a wonderful organization, worthy of your support. But, we also want you to know that                                    the Clark County Humane Society deals with the very same sad cases. We have also experienced the tragic things that can happen                                    to animals.Our canine and feline residents here at the Shelter often include those with amputations, eyes missing, broken legs and                                    spirits, etc. Some of the injuries are from accidents and others are caused by uncaring "humans". Whatever the cause, it's                                    not the animals fault and we have always done our very best to help them in any way we can.We ask that when you view this ad, you look at the animals eyes, think about the pain they must have been in to endure                                    the injury and afflictions they have. Then think about how right here at the Clark County Humane Society you can help. Help                                    us to care for those who need us most, the ones with no home, no family, no one to help them. That's what we do here. We take                                    sad stories with likely tragic endings and turn them into happy futures with new loving families.Come over to tour our Shelter during open hours and we'll be glad to show you the work being done here. You may be                                    so moved that you wish to join the team of kind and caring volunteers. So, please, by all means, send a contribution                                    to the ASPCA, but also remember the Clark County Humane Society right here in central Wisconsin too.
