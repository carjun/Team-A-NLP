There has already been deaths. 26 year old Mohammed Bouazizi drenched himself with petrol and set fire to himself on 17th December 2010. He later died from horrific injuries. He was protesting about the fact that he could not get a permit to work. Police had confiscated his wares. Another man is known to have electrocuted himself. Now police have opened fire, as more protests against unemployment have took place. Currently the death toll is unconfirmed. One report has said that a person died whilst other reports have put the number of deaths at four. Either way it is too many deaths. Hospital officials say that many people have been injured. The Tunisian protests which began in December 2010 concern freedom and unemployment. People are rightly unhappy about the lack of jobs available and their lack of freedom. In a country with such restrictions on daily life, protesting is not an easy option. It shows the desperate plight of the local people. The US has already expressed concern at the Tunisian police's handing of earlier protests. Tunisian officials have yet to comment.        1 of 6         Another country torn apart?      ethelsmith is based in Kingston upon Hull, England, United Kingdom,and is Anchor for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (45.8%) Germany (12.5%) Tunisia (9.1%) United Kingdom (9.1%) 19 other countries (15.5%)           READ MORE: tunisia unrest, tunisia protests, tunisia unemployment, Tunisia, Tunis, Africa, geography, Labor, Mohammed Bouazizidrenched, political-news, tunisian shot dead   More News From: Tunis :  Tunisia     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 2            Reply  Posted By     Kenneth Ang|about 16 hoursagoLooks like the economy is bad.
