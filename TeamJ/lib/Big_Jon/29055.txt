Same-sex marriage will dilute the ability to teach your children and grandchildren the truth... The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints recently joined with a large coalition of other faith-based organizations - in the Defense of Marriage.  In doing so, they have invited their members, of which I am one - to do all that [they] can to support and pass Proposition 8 in California.  This  would amend the California state             constitution to ensure that only a marriage between a man             and a woman would be legally recognized .  This article, is one of the ways in which I am accepting that invitation to help protect traditional marriage.  I believe that education is the key to ensuring that traditional marriage is preserved; thus this invitation was extended to those who embrace these truths and values in our society;  to join efforts to teach and proclaim that which is truth - to our friends, neighbors and associates.  In this article, I will frequently refer to commentary, in the form of a document that is now published on the LDS Newsroom, entitled The Divine Institution of Marriage, (DIM).  "The focus of the Churchs involvement is specifically same-sex marriage and its consequences. The Church does not object to rights (already established in California) regarding hospitalization and medical care, fair housing and employment rights, or probate rights, so long as these do not infringe on the integrity of the family or the constitutional rights of churches and their adherents to administer and practice their religion free from government interference.    The Church has a single, undeviating standard of sexual morality: intimate relations are proper only between a husband and a wife united in the bonds of matrimony." (DIM) Marriage between those who practice homosexuality, also known as same-sex marriage, distorts truth...  and the truth is that wickedness never was happiness.  It never will be.  Man, himself, may distort and even change laws to say otherwise, nonetheless, there are absolute truths, which are eternal, which come from God.    The natural consequences of choosing contrary to these innate truths - will bring about a future that will camouflage these truths, which are intended to bring about happiness not only now, but ultimately throughout eternity.  In our carelessness as a society, who will suffer the most?Alma 41:8-11Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved.   And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your God upon those points of doctrine, which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin.   Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.   And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.

The ability of parents to teach their children truth, will be greatly diluted if same-sex marriage proponents can convince you that they have equal rights...Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage Is Not What Is Best For The Family We are living in a world of individuals that have become conditioned to having what they want, whatever that may be - right now. A society based on instant gratification.  These individuals generally feel that they are entitled to satisfy these cravings, and no longer view them as such but wish to make them a right" of daily life.  Society in general, is beginning to accept these wants in others as legitimate, in order that they too may have their own "rights" or cravings - validated and protected.  "If I give allowances for the wants of others, then they must give allowances for me and my "wants" or desires."  Most people today are willing to accept this "common sense" philosophy, as fair and term it tolerance.What is happening in society today with this attitude of liberal tolerance for others in general - is changing the very culture of our communities, and ultimately our existence.    Although, what may not be immediately realized is the serious effect this attitude may have on the way our future generations will learn to make choices.  The moral values that you personally hold dear, and are potentially unwilling to stand for, because you don't want to force your beliefs on others - are at risk of becoming unrecognizable to future generations.  Perhaps, even your own children and grandchildren, of whom you have the greatest interest in their happiness and well being, will be unable to see clearly those values at all.It is my firm opinion, that if I find value in living by a personal standard of truth in my daily life, then it is also a truth worth standing up for when threatened.  It is equally important to teach that truth to my own children and loved ones as well.  It is my desire as a parent, to teach my children that which I believe will bring them the greatest happiness and joy in this life.  I am confident, that most every responsible parent feels the very same toward their own children and future generations, in their own heart, after all, what is a parent - but a teacher of truth.Are we ready, and willing - to allow the selfish desires of a few, to change the communal norms of what has been traditionally accepted as moral and right for Millennia?   As far as I am aware, God has not changed on His position, as to the definition of Marriage.  Through the legal endorsement of same-sex marriage, we risk a detrimental distortion to the understanding and truth -- of what Marriage is.   Marriage is between a man and a woman.  The definition of marriage, what a "marriage" is to accomplish, and why "marriage" is so highly regarded - are based in natural and eternal truths that are unchangeable.  Regardless of even what man may do to temporarily undo the sanctity of the Marriage Union, as it is intended, it remains unchanged in its purpose.  May I restate it in a stronger way, legally changing the definition of marriage - because a very small sect of the people wish it to be otherwise, will never change the Divine Institution of Marriage and its purposes for mankind.What this will do however, is distort truth in such a way that the spiritual progress of mankind will become degenerate in our society.  This distortion of truth will leave in its path future generations that will not be able to distinguish moral truths any longer.  The ability of parents to teach their own children, that which they believe to be right, and that which will bring them happiness - will be greatly diluted.   Moral parenting is at risk of being undermined because we may not understand completely the implications and consequences of our willingness to be so tolerant right now.LDS Members in California to Join ALL Those Who Stand for Truth!Teaching Children Truth - Is What Parents Do Most Effectively Imagine that your children, or grandchildren - will never know the true meaning of family?Every child born is entitled to both a mother and a father.  It is their birth "right".The traditional family is the beginning of truth...Marriage is only between a man and a woman.  This is the foundation to strong families and to future generations raised up in truth... Same-Sex Marriage Will Dilute The Ability That Parents Have To Teach Their Children TruthConsider the child, perhaps one of your own future children or grandchildren, who would be  brought up in a world where not only are same-sex marriages legalized, but the homosexual relationship is taught and accepted in your community as normal, and equally as acceptable as a heterosexual relationship?  They will be taught that it is an individual preference, which is completely natural.  They may even be taught that they now live in a much more evolved society than did those of their parents and grandparents.  The good old days, so to speak will be looked at as a time of intolerance and uneducated views.  In fact, the comparison of racial discrimination may be viewed side by side with the discrimination between same-sex behavior, comparing two completely different issues. They will be taught that such a thing was unthinkable and barbaric!  Your children and grandchildren are at risk, of believing this lie that is being presented to us today, as a truth naturally, having been exposed no other view.Our future teachers may even invite them to imagine a time when two women or two men who deeply loved each other and wanted to be a family were kept legally from professing their love in a marriage union!  This future teaching of "our" past mistakes may become shocking to our future generations, just as the discrimination of African Americans, is to us - now!  Today, "we" are a much more evolved world, and recognize the ignorance of past generations, right? Let me just ask a few sensitive questions...   Are you being accused of being ignorant right now, because you stand in defense of traditional marriage?   Or, perhaps you are one of those who are being viewed by the media as more evolved than the rest of us, and are fine supporting same-sex marriages, thinking this issue is about equal rights?  If you have fallen prey to such arguments, equal rights being parallel to the plight of those who practice homosexuality, by those in support of gay marriage, then we need to talk...  These two issues, that of race discrimination and those few who are demanding gay marriage - have absolutely no parallels whatsoever.  The outward appearance of an individual as being the only reason that a person is kept from having the same rights as another who has those rights, because they have the more "acceptable" color of skin to the majority, is easily defined as prejudice.  This is a passionate issue of our past, with lingering sensitivity today.  Most good people are embarrassed by our past histories, whether in relation to anothers race, sex or religion.  Yes, we all are much more evolved in these areas, with even more progress to make.  On these issues, we most likely can and do agree.Marriage As Ordained of God...  Same-Sex Marriage Has Nothing To Do With Equal Rights The proponents of same-sex marriage claim that their case is one of equal rights.  They would have you believe that homosexuals are being discriminated against, simply because they are not attracted to someone of the opposite sex.  Because of this ban on their ability to get married, they feel that they are being kept from benefits, that are extended to those in a legal marriage.  Included as a result in their list of demands, is for the rest of society to accept homosexual relationships, as normal to society in general. They are demanding that those of us who oppose same-sex marriage, validate it through legal means.  In order to make such demands of society - they are adamant in trying to convince the public that choice, has nothing to do with the practice of homosexuality,   "Born that way" is their cry!  However, the facts are, that there is no solid evidence for or against either conclusion - nature or nurture.  It continues to be - the great debate.I am personally offended for those who have been and still are, legitimately discriminated against - for that which they could never change!  A person with the certain color of skin, does not have any option whatsoever to be a different color, than that which they were born.  A woman, is a woman - regardless of any wishes she may have,to be a man.  With-holding equal treatment, opportunity, or rights in these circumstances - is true discrimination.  The very kind of discrimination for which the Constitution of the United States ensures will not be tolerated.In my opinion, these distortions and attempted parallels by proponents for same-sex marriage, should be an insult to all those who have truly suffered for that which they have no choice, but that which they are!   Those who have circumstances beyond their control, which make them different to others.  These, where there is absolutely no question that needs to be determined by society that they are - different from you or I.  Those, who have been discriminated against, because they are different, and not by choice!  These are the few, that when society discriminate against them - bring shame to us as humankind.  This shows a deep lack of compassion and love for others, and is the epitome of ignorance and pride!  To blur the lines between tolerance and clear discrimination is just wrong!We, as a people who represent parents and teachers, who cherish our morals and values, need to be wise to what is being perpetuated by the proponents for same-sex marriage in their desire for us to believe such distortions apply to gay marriage.   There are absolutely no comparable arguments, between what is happening to promote same-sex marriage now and the issues of such past discrimination in society.   If the advocates of same-sex marriage are able to convince you that it is the same issue, then I must respectfully say that you are being terribly misled.  However, if this argument is successful, and that the issue of same-sex marriage is accepted as one of equal rights, which it is not -- then there is no doubt, that future generations will readily accept these distortions - as the truth.Let me just make it very clear, that I am very sensitive to the plight of those with same-gender attraction.   The fact is, that there is much more that society could do, to support same-sex relationships; and help them acquire some of the rights that should be made available to any two individuals that are deeply committed to the care of each other. Protecting Tradtional Marriage Is The Right Thing To Do Same-Sex Marriage Is NOT An Issue of Tolerance As Elder Dallin H. Oaks of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has explained, "In todays secular world, the idea of tolerance has come to mean something entirely different. Instead of love, it has come to mean condone  acceptance of wrongful behavior as the price of friendship. Jesus taught that we love and care for one another without condoning transgression. But todays politically palatable definition insists that unless one accepts the sin he does not tolerate the sinner.      Elder Oaks continues, Tolerance obviously requires a non-contentious manner of relating toward one anothers differences. But tolerance does not require abandoning ones standards or ones opinions on political or public policy choices. Tolerance is a way of reacting to diversity, not a command to insulate it from examination.  The [LDS] Church does not condone abusive treatment of others and encourages its members to treat all people with respect. However, speaking out against practices with which the Church disagrees on moral grounds  including same-sex marriage  does not constitute abuse or the frequently misused term hate speech. We can express genuine love and friendship for the homosexual family member or friend without accepting the practice of homosexuality or any re-definition of marriage."   (DIM) It is my opinion, that too many of us are accepting the false definition of tolerance which then allows us to also accept, that which will ultimately tear apart the very fiber of what we hold most dear, the family.  Traditional marriage, in the Biblical sense, is still what mainstream Americans accept as the best way to perpetuate healthy families and future generations.  The majority of the reputable research which has been done on this issue remains supportive of these ideals that have been handed down from generation to generation even still; however, there are a few who promote research which is being distributed, that would have us believe differently.   Even within the process of how these studies have been conducted there are breeches of integrity which have been identified and exposed.  The proponents of same-sex marriage have far greater motivators than simply love between two people of the same sex as their foundation.  They intend to change the sanctity and reason for marriage, thus the intended purpose of the family, which is ordained of God.  Marriage Between A Man And A Women Is Beautiful To Behold... Marriage Between A Man and A Woman Is Central to Happiness"Marriage between a man and a woman is central to the plan of salvation. The sacred nature of marriage is closely linked to the power of procreation. Only a man and a woman together have the natural biological capacity to conceive children. This power of procreation  to create life and bring Gods spirit children into the world  is sacred and precious. Misuse of this power undermines the institution of the family and thereby weakens the social fabric.Strong families serve as the fundamental institution for transmitting to future generations the moral strengths, traditions, and values that sustain civilization. As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms, The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society.   Marriage is not primarily a contract between individuals to ratify their affections and provide for mutual obligations. Rather, marriage and family are vital instruments for rearing children and teaching them to become responsible adults. While governments did not invent marriage, throughout the ages governments of all types have recognized and affirmed marriage as an essential institution in preserving social stability and perpetuating life itself. Hence, regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, married couples in almost every culture have been granted special benefits aimed primarily at sustaining their relationship and promoting the environment in which children are reared. A husband and a wife do not receive these benefits to elevate them above any other two people who may share a residence or social tie, but rather in order to preserve, protect, and defend the all-important institutions of marriage and family.    It is true that some couples who marry will not have children, either by choice or because of infertility, but the special status of marriage is nonetheless closely linked to the inherent powers and responsibilities of procreation, and to the inherent differences between the genders. Co-habitation under any guise or title is not a sufficient reason for defining new forms of marriage" (DIM) The Divine Institution of Marriage Is For Happy Eternal Families A Commitment To Ensuring The Optimum Family Experience For My Posterity Through Traditional Marriage This issue, of defending traditional Marriage - to me, is a deeply personal issue.  I would like nothing more than to say to my neighbor that I am fine with them having their same-sex relationship validated, and perpetuating their lives as they please.  Of course I want them to be happy, but unfortunately, this issue of same-sex marriage is too deep and too far reaching in its affects upon future posterity. The kind of "tolerance" that I may wish to extend today, will have a lasting impact on the ability of future generations to experience the joy and happiness that God intended, through the family, as ordained by Him.  There can only be one definition of marriage - that it true. As a child of divorce, I understand the pain and suffering caused by the choice of their parents.  I know the confusion that is experienced by a child - when their world explodes.  I know what it is like to yearn for a father or a mother to be present in my life, even with an attempt at a replacement; it is just not the same. With my vivid memories of my own childhood, and the fall-out I have lived through as an adult child of divorce, I know that the traditional family, which rises up from the marriage between a man and a woman, even with all its frailties, is the absolute best for every child in this society still.  I believe firmly, that by nature it is our birthright, and that every child born is entitled to both a mother and a father.As a responsible adult, and a loving mother and grandparent, I am now committed to ensure the optimum family experience for each one of my own children and grandchildren, and my future generations to come.  That optimum family experience begins with marriage between a man and a woman.  I have learned that happiness comes from choosing what is true and right and working hard to maintain it.  It is worth our best efforts as a society, to give to our children the path to the greatest happiness that is available to them in this life!  To do anything less would be pure selfishness, and that is not true parenting."Strong, stable families, headed by a father and mother, are the anchor of civilized society. When marriage is undermined by gender confusion and by distortions of its God-given meaning, the rising generation of children and youth will find it increasingly difficult to develop their natural identity as a man or a woman. Some will find it more difficult to engage in wholesome courtships, form stable marriages, and raise yet another generation imbued with moral strength and purpose." (DIM)It is my sincere desire, that as we move forward and openly discuss the issue of same-sex marriage and its potential affects on future generations, that it will not be construed as a personal attack against those who have deep issues with homosexuality.  I am not a stranger to those who have struggled with issues of same-gender attraction.  It is from this very perspective, that I have gained a greater understanding and desire to teach,  what I believe to be the truth about same-sex marriage.   tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon - Kathryn Skaggs Note: You are invited to read the entire content of the document, The Divine Institution of Marriage, on the LDS Newsroom website.California Marriage Ammendment - Vote Yes on Proposition 8The Truth About Same-Sex Marriage, and What That Means to YOU!A Well Behaved Mormon Woman: Prop 8: Are Those 14 Words To Blame?The wording that The People have legally added to the state constitution in California, by the passing of Proposition 8 is quite simple -    "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California"Identical Twin Brothers: One Gay - One Straight  - A...Alongside a multitude of important and even critical issues, that we face as a Nation today - there stands as a raging sentinel... the topic of same-sex marriage!My Questions About Prop 8 In CaliforniaYes on Prop 8 Challenges Superintendent of Public Education to Live Debate, will it actually happen?

It's to be defined by communities, mainly religious groups. i.e., if you're a mormon, feel free to deny gays the right to legally bind their relationship. Since I don't believe marriage is a legal issue at all, this is a moot point on my end. I am married thru a covenant to my wife, not because the USA determines so.Let homosexuals marry, I don't think that in the end anyone can verify this type of thing destroys nations.

In The Doghouse2 years ago LDS Nana,Once again you have given us a very passionate article expressing your thoughts on the sanctitiy of marriage.  I will add my support in saying that marriage is between a man and a woman. This has been re-emphasized lately by prophets of God. First by Gordon B. Hickley, as stated in the document, The Family A Proclamation To The World, and more recently by  Thomas S. Monson, who has asked us as members to do all that we can to uphold this definition.  This statement is not new.  It has been the same since the beginning of time.In California the decision to redefine marriage is now being left in the hands of the voters.  In my humble opinion whatever the outcome of the election may be, with all the possible horrible repercussions you have suggested, the definition will still remain the same.  Marriage is between a man and a woman. LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago MrM -It is always a pleasure to have you come and stand.

Prop 8 in California if passed, will ensure that the traditional family, which is the bedrock of a strong society - will remain as such.It is my hope, that those who are considering the pros and cons of voting either way on Prop 8, will take into serious consideration that which we are discussing here.A vote for traditional marriage, is not a vote against homosexuality. Our cause, is simply to maintain that which will promote our ability as parents, to teach that which we consider to be true. It is our desire to live that which we teach and refrain from having that - which would dilute our beliefs be done, in such a disrespectful manner.Surely, Americans can work together for all involved without a lack of respect either way...tDMgLdsNana-AskMormonClaudia Goldstein2 years ago I believe a marriage is between a woman & a man, just like the Bible states and condemns homosexualityLdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago Claudia -Thank you for voicing your opinion.

Same-sex marriage has locked in and reinforced an existing Scandinavian trend toward the separation of marriage and parenthood. The Nordic family pattern--including gay marriage--is spreading across Europe. And by looking closely at it we can answer the key empirical question underlying the gay marriage debate. Will same-sex marriage undermine the institution of marriage? It already has."This is extremely compelling evidence to say the least.  I hope my readers will check out the links you have shared.  I firmly believe, that the more education that we are able to obtain regarding same-sex marriage, the more likely people will want to protect marriage.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormonTalidorn2 years ago Hey another very well thought out message.I lived in California when we voted to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman.  I was saddened to see how the will of the majority was overturned in California.A friend recently asked why I had such strong feelings against same-sex couples being allowed the right to marry, his belief is that it doesn't affect me.  I explained that it is a bit like living in a neighborhood with certain rules, standards and requirements.  I explained that if one my neighbors decided to spray oil over their entire yard instead of obeying the standards it would impact me.  My property values lower, the oil would begin to seep into my yard and destroy what I had worked hard to develop, and I would no longer enjoy spending time outdoors.The idea of equal right are always considered from the point of the "have-nots".  I suggest that those involved look at equality from the side of those impacted by such changes.  To make things equal, in the scenario I gave to my friend, I would need to allow my property value to lower, my family's health to be impacted and my enjoyment of the outdoors reduced.  What about my rights?  Why are my rights less important because I'm in the majority?  I think the http://www.finallyequal.com/ movie is a good example of where equality can go if we do not take a stand for ourselves now.TalidornPS - written quickly... so I might have missed some of my poor spelling issues.  I hope that my message comes across clearly and without sounding like a bigot. James 2 years ago I restate my position, The very nature of God's existance is life and fidelity. The two most grevious sins are murder and violating the law of chastity, Therefore Gods very existance is for life, and one of his greatest joys are that we remain chaste.when the institution of marriage becomes redefined by men, it becomes abominable in his eyes. It was his right to initiate this sacred institution, and who are we to tell him what marrage is?People make covenants before God to be one with their spouse and to follow the commandments of God.Remember that to be carnally minded is death, a death of the spirit. To engage in sexual immorality is to destroy one's own soul.Scent2 years ago I am against same sex anything and always have been. I do not think this is what will distroy our world though because there are so many things happening that everything conbined is what distroys our world.The only thing that we can do is raise our children with the right morals and values which will promote them to do the same with their children and so on. This is the only way for our world to heal from all that is distroying it.Mariehttp://go.visitmarie.comAndrew Webber2 years ago Marriage is about forming a life long partnership in order to create a stable family environment in which children can florish.

If a person finds that they have homosexual tendencies, this is not the issue.  It is when they act on those inclinations that it becomes that which I believe is unacceptable to God.  I know many good people in this exact situation, but who make a choice to keep the commandments of God.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon Chef Jeff2 years ago Andrew webber, the idea for gay people is tobe able to visit a sick partner in the hospital, which can be created through the bond of a Civil Union.  Marriage is not needed to create the freedom to create a will that names a partner as the beneficiary, if Civil Union is allowed.I am not gay, and so I don't pretend to know all the answers from a Gay person's point of view.  But many of the people my wife and I know are Gay, and it has often been the case that two same-sex partners do not have the rights the heterosexual majority possesses.I strongly believe that if civil unions were not opposed in the same way as so-called Gay marriage, this issue would not be such a large thing.I also agree mostly with T.Kelly that a lot of this should be up to the churches, not the state.  As I have written in some of my hubs, the separation of church and state is much more oriented toward protecting religious freedom than to take it away.If people want to vote on the proposition being put forth in California, it may risk being struck down by the state Supreme Court.  Even if not there, it will most likely go the U.S. Supreme Court, where it will have to pass a very strict test of Constitutionality.I also agree that traditional marriage is between a man and a woman, and I cringe at the idea that making marriage a matter of state control, as opposed to strictly church authorised, will open up a possible slippery slope sometime in the future.When you give politicians control over such matters, they can do some really dumb things with it!  That said, I am happy in one way that churches are becoming active to define how they view the entire matter.LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago Chef Jeff -Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and opinions here on the topic of same-sex marriage; and those issues that are affected by it.  I always appreciate the kind and respectful manner in which you express your point of view.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon starrkissed2 years ago I have to disagree here, but your hub is very well written.LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago starrkissed -Very kind of you to take the time to say so...  I am glad that you took the time to read it:-)tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon efeglo2 years ago Bibles say we should train them in the way they should grow and when they are old, they will not depart.  That is the truth of the bible, children need good training for them to become good citizens, cause we need good governance, they are the leaders of tomorrow.drmati2 years ago Several of you have asked about why gays would want to marry anyway. Why, the same reason that we heteros want to marry - to establish a life long connection with someone, complete with legal and financial obligations to one another. And, most importantly, to raise a family. Yes, there are many fine, law abiding, cultured, compassionate gay people out there who want to raise children and have the talent, finances, and energy to do so. By establishing a bond of marriage with a partner, they can ensure that their children (often adopted) will enjoy the same financial security, etc. that we do. in other words, if you and your fiance decide to have children, you'll probably want to marry first (even if you're already living together). Why? Because you surely want the children to have the legal and financial protection that marriage provides. It's a binding contract, despite the unfortunate fact that divorce rates are so high. Which brings me to another point - those of us (me included) who want to protect the family should be putting our energies into bringing that divorce rate down - whether for hetero OR homosexual marriages. Let's promote marriage period - it really IS in danger and working to promote better family life, more understanding between spouses, etc. is the way to help, not defining what is or is not a marriage according to our religious convictions (my religious convictions, Jewish, are the origin or all the later ones in our Western culture that define marriage - but I stil do not think that in this day and age, we should be concentrating on that issue - issues change - thousands of years ago in the ruins that were once a thriving community of the tribe of Menasshe which is located about a 10 minute walk from my house here in Israel, homosexuality must have been associated with various kinds of idol worship and was banned - but even the Bible doesn't make much of an issue of it - yes, one line in Leviticus is about all there is - the prophets wasted precious little time on it - instead, they spoke out against immoral cults (idol worship), murder, economic oppression - oppressing widows and orphans, and other activities that are today recognized as clearly wicked.  With the high rate of divorce in America, Europe, and other places, with the continuing wholesale murder of Christians in Sudan, I think there are enough Biblical causes to attend to without making a small population of homosexuals and their children feel even more alienated than they already feel.James2 years ago Nana, I believe that it is evident throughout history that when immorality reigns and the family unit becomes oppressed, destruction ensues, Take for example, the people of Sodom and Gommorah. in this case only an entire city was destroyed, but it is evident that there have been other worlds that reigned in wickedness which were baptized in fire much closer to the beginning of their existance.MormonSoprano2 years ago Nana, this is a fantastically written post with a LOT of information and points to ponder. I particularly enjoyed the videos and the beautiful photos which emphasise the sacred nature of marriage and the family. It is critical that we protect the definition of marriage at all costs and that we protect our children. We must also protect our society from a small minority of misguided individuals. The video clips shared prior to my comment are extremely telling. As stated above:<blockquote>"Are we ready, and willing - to allow the selfish desires of a few, to change the communal norms of what has been traditionally accepted as moral and right for Millennia? As far as I am aware, God has not changed on His position, as to the definition of Marriage.  Through the legal endorsement of same-sex marriage, we risk a detrimental distortion to the understanding and truth -- of what Marriage is"</blockquote>Standing for the definition of marriage as One man and One woman is standing for Truth. It's simple, and it's critical. LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago efeglo -Teaching combined with the proper example are how we as parents can be most effective with training up our children.  If same-sex marriages are "forced" upon society as "normal", then as parents - our ability to be seen by our children as "the way" to truth, will be greatly undermined.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago drmati -In my opinion, your entire argument is in the reverse as to why we should stand up and protect traditional marriage in this country.  If you believe that having a family is the ultimate reason that those who practice homosexual desire "marriage" -- you would believe that children would come first in the desire to marry.If children come first as a priority in that marriage, then WHY would we want anything but the absolute best to offer the children of this Country?When I made the decision to marry my husband thirty years ago, the majority of that which you mentioned was not even a consideration for me personally.  My interest was in starting a family with my true-love and having our children together...  hence to form a family.The benefits that the government offers those who choose to make a commitment, legally bound, was originally established  to encourage the propagation of healthy communities and future civilizations of the same type of traditional families;  the core unit of healthy, moral and well adjusted societies.The main reason for receiving government benefits in a marriage, are not "me" or even "us" based.  Children are meant to become the beneficiaries of ALL that the government offers the couple who are married; in creating strong traditional families.When the government offers a couple who "marry" benefits, they do so to benefit the future of the children born into these families -- so that this "best" unit will continue into the next generation.  The traditional family is the best unit of any society - hands down.  Should we all not want the very best for our children...  not necessarily that we are serving ourselves.Those who believe that legalizing same-sex marriages will decrease the rate of divorce in this Country, thus strengthening marriage - are sadly mistaken.  The reason divorce will go down, is ONLY because "marriage" will lose its appeal in future generations.  This is a fact.Legalizing same-sex marriage has the affect of diminishing marriage in general, thus divorce statistics "seem" to decrease.  This is one of the great distortions that the proponents of same-sex marriage are utilizing.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormontDMgLdsNana-AskMormon LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago Mormon Soprano -Thank you for sharing your "tune" in regards to tradtional marriage and the sacredness of the family.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon Onusonus2 years ago The maening of Marriage is symbolic to the union between Christ and the church. Just as is spoken by Christ, the bridegroom, who will come and enter into an everlasting covenant with those who are prepared. Thus the kingdom of heaven is likened unto ten virgins who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago Onusonus -For those of us who hold "Marriage" as a sacred and holy union, this is precisely correct.  In essence, Jesus Christ is the Bridegroom and the Church, His Bride.  The sacred union between one man and one woman is symbolic of "their" single union, in preparation to the Marriage with the Lamb of God - as ONE.  This is the divinely ordained relationship that perpetuates the entire family of God from all eternity to all eternity.Thank you for sharing this important facet of the divine institution of marriage.  Perhaps with this understanding, those who seek any other definition of marriage, will consider what they are pressing against, for those of us who hold these beliefs with reverence.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon Ken Harouff2 years ago Amen, I say, Amen. Marriage "laws" would have never been needed a 100 years ago, have you ever thought why? Where there not "gay" people back then? Of course there where. Did they not want to be more open about it? BINGO! It was not openly accepted social behavior, key word being openly. We are bombarded daily on TV in magazines and in the news about the gay movement. Colleges adding non gender rest rooms for the truly confused, corporations sending employees to training camps to learn how to incorparate homosexuals into senior management. The problem goes beyond question number 8 on a ballot. Even with laws to protect marriage, how do we protect our youth from being convinced they are gay? The lifestyle is unhealthy, death age is way below normal, violence in relationships is more predominent, more suicides, the list goes on and on.Amen, I say, Amen. I agree we need these laws as a start, not the end of the problem though. I do not hate those who profess to be gay, I love them as I do all my neighbors. We need more prayer and these prayers need to be in unison. Christians-Mormans-Jewish-Catholic all at the same time, for the same thing, with the same reasons! Together we could make a differance.Peace Be With You.Onusonus2 years ago I say, Do what you can to stand up for rightousness, be bold but not overbearing. Judge rightously and tolerate no evil in your midst. Fear no evil for God is with us, and have patience with the world because all things happen in their appointed time.Laura2 years ago Hello LDS Nana,Ive been doing a bit of novice research on the big Rs (Rights) of this situation in CA. Heres what I have gathered in a nutshell which should be of interest to everyone no matter where they come down on this issue.1) On Rights Granted by the State of CA to same sex partners:California already has on its books (and has for several years) laws granting domestic partners (homosexual and heterosexual) the same civil rights as married couples. This is a point that many people seem not to understand. Here is the language of just one California statute: Registered domestic partners shall have the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law, whether they derive from statutes, administrative regulations, court rules, government policies, common law, or another provisions or sources of law, as are granted to and imposed upon spouses. Moris A. Thurston2) On Rights Granted by the Federal Government to same sex partners in CA:The Defense of Marriage Act signed into law by President Clinton continues to this day to block same sex partners from federal recognition and federal benefits/rights. Hence, a yes vote for Prop 8 is not yanking federal benefits away from such partnerships that they still do not currently have in CA even with the legalization of Gay marriage. No matter how one votes on Prop 8, those Federal benefits for such CA same sex marriages won't be granted until the US Supreme Court intervenes and decides otherwise.Case in point, the legalization of Gay marriage in CA essentially has only advanced one thing and its not any additional rights. It is the ability for Same Sex partner A and partner B to put their names on an application and have the state stamp the word marriage on it.I think these are important distinctions to make when we discuss Prop 8. A yes on Prop 8 is not yanking away anyones civil rights -- such partnerships will have state rights comparable to marriages no matter what happens with Prop 8 and either way, they will continue not to have access to federal marriage rights. It seems Prop 8 really is exclusively about preserving the former definition of marriage.Best to All,LauraLdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago Laura -Thank you for taking the time to layout these "rights" and how they are applied to current law.  This is pertinent to understanding the ongoing discussion about same-sex marriage and Prop 8 in California.It is not necessary for same-sex partners to have "marriage" in order to obtain the legal "rights" that they are seeking.  Partners A and B, have most of the rights through "Registered domestic partners" act.The affect of the "family" is where there are some questions to consider, when the legal union of a "marriage" is not allowed.  Therefore, protecting traditional marriages goes beyond the partnership of two people, but affect the "family" as we have valued for millenia.Therefore, if "marriage" is given to those who practice homosexuality, it is most likely desired for personal validation.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon Onusonus2 years ago Somtimes I think that they wan't their lifestyle choices to be accepted by God, rather than just the legal points. Perhaps it is a feeling of persicution, and I couldn't imagine the shoe being on the other foot.This however, is a standing fact; the laws of God are not set by popular demand, afterall the people couldn't vote on the law of gravity. Still I have compassion for those who struggle with their spirituality, truely their road is like a vessle in the storm.LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago Onusonus -Whether validation is sought from God or society, nonetheless, those who practice homosexual behaviors and demand that society legalize their relationships, are a relatively small sect of our communities.Hopefully as more people are educated; as to why there is such an importance that traditional marriage is upheld, that it is the best unit for society, that a vote to defend traditional marriage is NOT  a vote against gay people, but a vote to uphold mainstream values and beliefs...  then perhaps we can figure something else out, for this small group of individuals?tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon Ken Harouff2 years ago http://ccgaction.org/family/protectmarriage/cathfoI did not know if you are already working with this group?God BlessLdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago Ken Harouff -Thank you for sharing this resource.  I will definitely follow-up.  I am actively working with our local Church groups, to both gather and distribute information about Prop. 8.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon Onusonus2 years ago Excelent point Nana. All to often mainstream socioty becomes duped into swaying towards the opinion of the few popular ones. Holywood would have you believe that the entire world has jumped into the immorality pool only to leave the few old fashioned prudes to rot on the beach, But I say there are more of us than them.LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago Onusonus-The unfortunate truth, is that mainstream media - has a lot of money to perpetuate their distortions.  Their target market is the youth of this Country.  It is the youth, that are the not only the "now", but ALL our futures.If the media is able to distort truth, without the voice "of" truth standing up in opposition - then there is little doubt WHO will win this battle.  The ability to spread "true" truth - in this world, has everything to do with how deep pockets either "side" has.  That is not a good scenario...It is important that each one of us, who desires to defend that which we believe God has ordained - must keep talking and talking and talking, to all those who are willing to listen.  Good people will "feel" the truth, and most likely - follow that which IS good.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon allshookup2 years ago Good hub. I totally agree with you. Marriage was ordained by God and is ALWAYS between a man and a woman. We are also part of a coliation in trying to get this same-sex marriage law stopped and in the case of Cali, changed. This is so sad to me that so many in our country feel that it's a good thing. Where are the morals and vaules our country was founded on? God help us! I appreciate you standing for what's right. God bless!LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago allshookup -Wonderful!  I'm really glad that you, too, are willing to get out and shake things up a bit in your parts.  Of course, as you well know, this is a campaign to educate and inform.  We must educate our young people in particular about what this could all possibly mean, for their future...tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon Ken Harouff2 years ago http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/family/396Another article about the local churches gathering together on this.Peace Be With YouLondonGirl2 years ago So if a gay couple, who are Hindu / Muslim / Jewish / aethist / agnostic want to marry, feel it is right for them, and want to commit to each other, what has it got to do with you?In the UK, we have civil partnerships. The same as civil marriage, in registry offices, giving the same rights and responsibilities to the couple as a legal marriage does. And rightly so. LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago LondonGirl -Those of us, who support a Yes vote on Prop 8 - are defending the only definition of marriage, which is between a man and a woman.  Many of us have no quarrel with same-sex couples seeking a "civil partnership", to gain the benefits of a legal bond.We are opposed to any other definition of marriage.  I think the UK has the right idea.  Too bad same-sex couples cannot follow your lead...Thank you for commenting.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormon equality2 years ago What if you were not able to be with the person you love? It is hard to understand your point of view when you say you have no problem with homosexuals but then support a legal action that categorizes them as second class citizens. Homosexuals want the same rights as married heterosexual couple. This legal action does not interfere with your chosen religion. I can guarantee that most homosexuals have no interest in being wed in your church seeing as that almost all of you have spoken of damnation. Gay people are going to be in this world whether you approve or not and as time has proven they are becoming more wildly accepted each year. Sooner or later you have to realize you really do not have the right to determine someone else's future.LdsNana-AskMormon2 years ago equality -If all you are pressing for, is the same "rights" as heterosexual couples who are married, then you confuse me.Civil Unions in California, DO provide homosexuals with the same benefits as married couples. Currently, the government legalizes marriage. Therefore, man-law is required for marriages, wherever they are performed. However, "marriage" is traditionally and culturally a male/female relationship. Marriage has never been intended to make second-class citizens fo anyone.The biological fact is, that every single person ever born into this world - has come forth only as a product of the male/female biology. Your citizenship within society, is a product of this reaction. You are no second class citizen, IMHO.If you as a citizen, desire marriage - then you may do so - according to the established pattern, of perpetuating the family, and society at large. I understand that the law may very well change the definition of marriage, however - Marriage, according to the Bible - is between a man and a woman. If you are no respecter of this, then certainly we have oppositional opinions.Certainly our opinions, are our "right".tDMgLdsNanalivelonger2 years ago http://mormonsformarriage.com/Proof that not all Mormons (to your religion's credit) are intent on treating gays and lesbians as second-class citizens.

We as individuals need to do all we can to protect the institution of Marriage- ONE MAN and ONE WOMAN !!!stephhicks682 years ago Hi Kathryn, I usually try to stay out of this debate.  I am a Christian, and not homosexual.  I don't understand the lifestyle, but I will not condemn it.  My husband's aunt lives with the same woman she has shared her life with for over 20 years.  I only hope that for the two of them that when one or the other passes, they will be able to have the same rights as a married couple.  Whether or not that requires a marriage license, I don't know.  It varies from state to state.  Nice job on this Hub.Stephanie packerpack23 months ago I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but I just do not understand the meaning of same sex relationship. Relationship shared between a man and a woman is the most beautiful thing that exist in the world. How can just someone not like it? And what about the family values when there will not be any family between same sex people? As I said before, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but I do not see any logic in such relationship.luvintkandtj20 months ago I like this hub. Although I whole heartedly disagree. i love the clear and concise manner in which you give the information. I felt it was respectful to both sides of the arguement. And to some exstent I can see your point of view. My issue with this is as follows1) There are plenty of same sex couples that raise healthy well round heterosexual children.2) There are many heterosexual couples that raise well rounded gay children.3) With the growing number of absent fathers and children in the foster care system, shouldn't the focuz be more on these families in true crisis?4)How does it affect anyone who is NOT involved?These are the questions that I have. I am a heterosexual and have come to know many people. People of all sex, creeds, religion and sexual preference. I choose to judge a person based on the value of their heart. I think that love is a wonderful thing and if two people decide  that they want to committ their lives to each other then they have the right.But of course their are two sides to every arguement.LdsNana-AskMormon20 months ago Luvintkandtj -Thank you for seeing this hub as an expression of my opinion, and not that which is meant to hurt others.  Thank you also, for stating your feelings in such a respectful manner.Although your opinion seemingly is harmless, and for some it may be true -- as a society, it is our responsibility to ensure the very best possible circumstances for our community to thrive and perpetuate itself.Traditional marriage is by far the best environment for children to be brought up in -- and we owe ensuring this, to future generations.  Nature also affirms this, as every child brought into this world, comes through the coming together of one male and one female.  Maintaining traditional/natural marriage is the best way I can think of to be GREEN!  And, isn't THAT what we are ALL about these days?Thanks for commenting.tDMgLdsNana-AskMormonlesbian love story19 months ago Sexual orientation is a matter of personal choice, same-sexpartners should be given equal rights and benefits and same-sex marriages should not be looked down upon.LdsNana-AskMormon19 months ago Lesbian love story -As you stated, "sexual orientation is a matter of personal choice". I agree -- in my opinion, it is a lifestyle choice. I don't believe that society is obligated to grant equal status to a select group of people, simply because they demand it. I firmly believe that there is only one definition of marriage - between a man and a woman. ALL can make the choice to be married, IF they marry one of the opposite sex.  There is no discrimination.tDMgurimidden19 months ago A very well written article. It is obvious you possess the rare ability (or at least the ability few take the time to employ) to honestly and objectively assess the future implications of chosen perceptions and the directions they lead as exponential variants of relative impressions conform to our accepted or established beliefs. Meaning, what we choose today must reflect what we choose tomorrow, and if people are truly going to attempt to create a world which exists within a "perception is reality" conceptualization then they will eventually find themselves lost, seeking pleasures and palatabilities rather than fiduciary compliances and moral structure.That this nation actually intends to incessently question eternal truths with no concern for the dilution of thought that is being created as they propose to constantly redefine the world is incredibly preposterous and corrosive to our society.Oprah, in her commencement speech to college grads actually stated "if it feels good do it", and "if you hit a brick wall, it is life telling you to change directions"...and she has her own magazine. This nation is in certain crises.I say that if you hit a brick wall, you may need to punch a hole in it, or even climb over it. But certainly, if it feels good, the very first thing one must do is ask why, and what may be the limits and liabilities.I am so glad there are other people who can see the corrosive long term effects of the decisions people are so casually making these days.Great Hub!LdsNana-AskMormon19 months ago urimidden -Thank you for taking the time to comment.  Yes, it is beyond unfortunate that society refuses to look ahead to the consequences for poor decision making now, at the risk of all our futures.  We are a society of immediate gratifications, of which there will be a price, to be paid.tDMghelenathegreat19 months ago I don't know that marriage is SO well-thought-of.  What do you think of people like Britney Spears, who get married drunkenly in Las Vegas and get divorced or annulled soon after?  Is that okay because it's between a man and a woman?Homosexuality is not about immediate gratifications; this is the major flaw I see in your argument.  Clearly you are misunderstanding a fundamental issue at hand.  Same-sex marriage has nothing to do with instant gratification (gay bars, on the other hand...).  It is about love and recognition that you are human.I seriously disagree with the above commenter that you are being "objective" here.  Clearly you are coming from a far-right standpoint and there is no way to change your mind.  That is obviously the opposite of objective.  You are analyzing things the way your Church has taught you to see them, and it's painfully obvious with every sentence you write.You don't know anything about same-sex couples raising children, and you clearly are not taking into account all of the children languishing in the broken foster care system.  Two loving parents is better than no loving parents.And I do not think that the Mormon church should start marrying gay couples.  Obviously, I do not want to force my beliefs on anyone.  No church should have to perform marriages against which it stands fundamentally.  But I hate to break it to you, but this is America, and we believe strongly in the separation of Church and State.  Ethics can be secular, and they MUST be when discussing rule of law.(I still respect you as a hubber, of course, but it makes me extremely angry to see such ignorance written and then respected by so many people.)LdsNana-AskMormon19 months ago helenathegreat -Thank you for taking the time to comment.Just so you know, I have given much thought to many of the points that you brought up.  These are my opinions.  I do not consider myself ignorant of this issue, by any stretch of the imagination.Regardless of how I base my opinions should not be a concern to anyone.  My positions are as valid as the next persons -- and because I may disagree with someone else and how they base their position -- is irrelevant.   Our votes have equal power in this country.You and I, simply have different views -- both are equally important.tDMghelenathegreat19 months ago Yes, both are equally important and valid -- after all, this is the beauty of democracy.  Like you said, both our votes are equal.But your title claims that this is the TRUTH about same-sex marriage, so calling it merely your opinion is clearly not quite what you mean.I just can't wait until neuroscience proves how idiodic this entire argument is.Daniel Carter19 months ago The issue, in its proper perspective should be about equal rights, not about marriage. How to define a household is the larger issue regarding equal rights for all people. Gay people are just one small area. Another example is grandparents raising their grandchildren. Without legal guardianship, they often get hit with a higher tax bracket (no deductibles) same visitation issues in hospital, etc., and several more things. Other "alternative families" face the exact same issues as gays and lesbians.Marriage in this case is over emphasized. What is happening is a breakdown in basic human rights, not gay rights. The bigger picture is more important than the agenda of the minority group. Likewise, the Mormon church could be considered a minority group. What is important is whether or not that minority groups beliefs and actions are consistent with equal rights for all people.LdsNana-AskMormon19 months ago Daniel -Interesting thoughts.  Thanks for taking the time to share.  I am a firm believer in "equal rights" for all people.  When it comes to marriage, I believe there is only one definition.  It is not about exclusion.  If we were to redefine marriage to include any combination of individuals who desire legal partnership, then ultimately, we lose the true essence of marriage.I am in full agreement, that all those who wish to have legal protections and benefits of such relationships, should have that available to them.  Fighting over  "marriage" as that avenue - is not the way to accomplish that goal.tDMgI'm my own Boss19 months ago LDSNana -I'm a fan of your writing.  Nicely done. My 2 cents...Moral issues shouldnt be governed by man.  PERIOD!The whole premise behind the wall of separation (separation of church and state) is to keep the government out of churches and vice versa. The fact that its gotten to this point in our country where the government is as involved as it is, is very discouraging.There are civil rights such as housing, jobs, etc that no one should be denied, regardless of their lifestyle choices. But why is marriage a civil right?Marriage is spiritual in nature.  If someone marries for reasons that arent deeply rooted in passion, love or something spiritual (not religious), then they are better off forming a legal partnership, an LLC or Corporation.  If its just a business transaction, for taxes, etc., then the states have already have agreements for that.Because so many special interest groups are quite vocal and have forced the government to get involved, we have no choice but to counteract the situation we feel like we are being forced into.  Its not our choice but our obligation to defend our rights, not take away others.You know as well as I do that once the government gets involve with an issue and makes it legal/illegal, the wall is permanently torn down and when you give an inch, people unfortunately take a mile. I can guarantee that if all states make gay marriage legal, then churches, who discriminate (for lack of a better term) against gays by not allowing them to get married in the church of their choice, will consequently lose some of their rights as a church. Because its gotten to the point in which it has, we are forced to vote to protect our rights, not take away others rights.The separation of Church and StateIm sorry, but that wall is slowly being torn down.Chris5 weeks ago You say we live in a world of people who get their way? But really whos getting there way here. The world changes, and theres nothing you can do about it. Technology gets faster better, different and unique. Marriage changes,cheating, lying nothing is perfect. It's just about a change for this. God will forgive their "sins" for being in love.hillrider5 days ago To be honest, what I see here is a biased view that only offers one side of an issue and seeks to promote it's view rather than offer any form of solution. It is certainly easy to spout out that another is the source of all issue and that America is short sighted in facing issues.Here is a more interesting question at least to me.Of all the obvious effort spent to validate and support your position have you spent an equal effort to find solutions ? Rhetoric is great for people who seek popularity but if you feel this issue is so pressing where is the effort to offer any solution ?I admit I am disappointed to have taken the time to consider all you have shared only to find that I was unable locate a single resolution other than that your position be adhered to.hillrider5 days ago I had to return and then will move away and allow you your hub without my intrusion.MY reasons for commenting earlier take no position on your topic because it wasn't relevant in my discussion. I made my comment because I agree with the adage that if you're not part of the solution you ARE part of the problem. And simply stating a biased view isn't what I believe we are supposed to provide, not for the Hub pages rules but as individuals.If the issue is that same sex unions are different than the marriage you promote how can that avenue be explored ? Should we, if we are protecting marriage make steps beyond voting for this or that bill to pass ? And what would those steps be ?Stirring up support among people who agree with your position may obtain your objective which appears to be getting the bill passed. It however does little to suggest anything viable as a means of solving the "problem" you make so abundantly clear exists and is spreading inordinately from the "small sect" of individuals who disagree. I won't vote on this hub but not because it lacks quality or usefulness, but because it isn't helpful to resolving anything. Sorry that is just MY opinion.LdsNana-AskMormon5 days ago Hi hillrider --I appreciate your taking the time to share your feelings about this hub.  My intention here on Hubpages is to write about the LDS faith and what we believe, and as well address relevant issues that relate to Mormonism.  I do this not as an official representative of the Church, but as a lay member.The doctrine of marriage between a man and a woman is central to the teachings of Mormonism, therefore I am comfortable writing on this topic here on Hubpages and how I believe it will affect society.  I have done this referring to official Church statements.I disagree with your assessment that I am "stirring up support" for this position. Rather, I see my position as more of an educator on a specific issue.The issue of same-sex marriage, on a national level continues to be debated.  I expect that this will go on for quite sometime.
