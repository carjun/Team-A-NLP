So she said, he was personally upset because he knew Giffords personally, and we all know people say things in the heat of the moment that they want to take back later.Hey Candy, at this point, Dupnik has not taken back shit.

Unfortunately, you need to put yourself in the place of the person vulnerable to attack and assassination and then explain what your nature as an investigator tells you.The Sheriff was very right to make that accusation. Those radio and televisions hosts who are preparing their hate filled shows for the following week will have to ratchet back the rhetoric now that he has them in his crosshairs, to use a metaphor from the right.

He COULD be incited by the bumper sticker on your car? or the fact you cut him off? or the fact they were out of juicy fruit at the impulse buy section?The list of things that COULD incite someone to do something nefarious is both long and tedious. What should we do? Lock ourselves away in rubber rooms for fear that something we do or say MIGHT somehow induce a disturbed person to do something wicked? We should all hug and wear fluffy rainbows and agree on everything so that no one would ever have a reason to do something terrible? It's unrealistic.People use tragedies like this to shut down speech and symbols they don't like. Go live in fear if you want. Go incite fear if you want.I don't live my life like that and don't expect others to either.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopHannah Bell      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 07:28 PMResponse to Reply #8386.The same unprofessionalism you chide the sheriff for applies equally to the politiciansEdited on Sun Jan-09-11 07:29 PM by Hannah Bell& media figures who pepper their public statements with thinly-veiled incitement to violence against their political enemies.  sometimes not-so-thinly-veiled.The pima county sheriff is an elected position.  he's a politician.you appear to be holding him to a higher standard or focusing on his conduct while ignoring conduct worse by several magnitudes -- in the same state.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCid_B      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 07:36 PMResponse to Reply #8689.Possible...While I understand Sheriff is an elected position I still view them as law enforcement first and that may be asking too much for some and is also my own personal bias.In any case, I think that he does disservice to himself and the investigation as an LE professional.

She called him earlier this year and told him that her vote for Health Care reform was because of my father's talk with her.They have worked on tax policy and financial policy together.
