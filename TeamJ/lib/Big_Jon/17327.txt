If not, I can continue to explain.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcleanhippie      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:45 PMResponse to Reply #6063.Another strawman.I see that you refuse to see this from any perspective but your own, so have fun and a nice day.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopEFerrari      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 06:47 PMResponse to Reply #6365.Your comparison is faulty to the point of being absurd.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topforty6      (156 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:37 PMResponse to Original message47.Congrats to you for calling him a hero, it's just the part about why ...it might need to be stated that this guy is a hero, NOT BECAUSE HE IS GAY, but because he is a hero AND HE IS GAY!That's the only point here.   So often we don't get to know this about our hero's..so often.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcleanhippie      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:59 PMResponse to Reply #4753.But if his being gay had nothing to do with him being a herowhy include it in the headline.

Because clearly, you don't get it.  Either that, or you are simply being argumentative and disruptive.I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt, but it's difficult after reading your responses in this thread.  But in an attempt to be helpful, I would suggest that you try educating yourself on the civil rights struggles, now and in the past, to understand the institutionalized bigotry that perpetuates discrimination that still exists in this country.  Maybe then you will understand how it feels like a triumph for an openly gay man to be recognized as brave and heroic.

To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting it with a superficially similar yet unequivalent proposition (the "straw man"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topforty6      (156 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 05:22 PMResponse to Reply #3337.Oh you want to be funny now?strawman?Give me a break, the guy is proud of who he is, and humble about what he did.Give it a rest.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcleanhippie      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:03 PMResponse to Reply #3755.Look, another one.Give me a break, the guy is proud of who he is, and humble about what he didDid I say anything to the contrary?

Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopWestSeattle2      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 09:33 PMResponse to Original message82.I travel across this country frequently, and live in one of the bluest cities in the country. I can see why some are curious why the young man's sexual orientation is mentioned at all in this story about his heroism. I would say that for the vast majority of citizens in large urban blue cities, his sexual orientation is not newsworthy at all. The reason being is that it's commonplace to have gay and lesbian cops, firefighters, politicians, business leaders, religious leaders, and other pillars of the community, hero's in many cases, out and outspoken; it's an accepted fact of life. That said, I can understand why it would be newsworthy in the vast majority of America - which is a sad commentary. For far too many American's, their image of what a gay man or lesbian is, is a farcical stereotype perpetuated with malicious intent by some; by shear ignorance by others. The fact that many are wondering what the big deal is though, underscores the great strides that the gay community has made over the last 40 years! In some large cities, we now have a generation coming of age who grew up with gay and lesbian leaders in their communities, and honestly don't consider someone's sexual orientation newsworthy at all.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 09:54 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss Latest Breaking NewsPowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
