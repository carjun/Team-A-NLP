He is crazy and evil  a word not used enough, Mr. Erickson writes. The guy is very clearly not of the tea party movement, not a Dittohead, not led by Sarah Palin, me, or anyone else on the right.He adds: But the media, at least as of this morning and its accumulated coverage so far on this matter, could not care less. The media is intent on yet again exploring right-wing rhetoric and tea party hate. Left-wingers yesterday were falling all over themselves to blame everyone on the right for the horrific shooting.Jack Shafer, writing in Slate, agrees with Mr. Erickson that the political rhetoric is not to blame.More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Crime, Government, Media, Other Things, Politics, Updates, Womena leading conservative blogger, conservatives, Erick Erickson, RedState.com, Shooter being tied to the political right, Tucson shooting rhetoricRead moreWill the Democrats be able to gain control of Congress again by 2016?January 9, 2011jamesb101No commentsIn this piece from the New Republic...Ed Kilgore aargues that things may not be too good for Democrats for up to the next six years..He has Obama winning re-election and all.ButHe points what Daniel has been saying hereRought times ARE ahead for Democrats in the House with reapportionment and the GOP gains in state housesAnd the Democrats having to defend 23 of the 33 Senate seats up for grabs in less than two years And finally ..With the Democrats having to gain 42 seats in the House to gain control of that body back..Kilgore is correct in that Progressives and Liberals have their work cut out for themBut that was true anyways since modern Democratic Presidents are pragmatistsNOT liberals like the Republicans like to label them..THE PERMANENT CAMPAIGNGet Used To It: Liberals Wont Get Anything Done For the Next Six YearsWeve all heard that Democrats are in for a very difficult two years. The new GOP majority in the House of Representatives will wage a campaign to disable health reform, financial regulation, and the EPA; stonewall executive and judicial appointments; slash nondefense discretionary spending (thus undermining the economic recovery); gut Social Security and Medicare; and launch investigations into every possible White House indiscretionpotentially leading to a vote for impeachment. Democrats only recourse will be to practice what Howard Dean famously derided as damage controlto abandon hope for big progressive accomplishments and hunker down until 2012, like the Clinton administration did after the Gingrich Revolution, defending government from the worst excesses of those who would like to eliminate it altogether.Theres only one problem with this scenario: the time-frame. Politicos and pundits are used to thinking in two-year cycles, and its easy to convince oneself that, in 2012, Obama will be able to capitalize on an improved economy, favorable voter-turnout patterns, and aweak GOP presidential field in order to sweep into office with a renewed mandate. But that misses a big part of the picture. Even if Obama wins reelection by a comfortable margin, its most likely that the House will remain in Republican hands and Democrats will lose seats in, and perhaps control of, the Senateand beyond that, Republicans will probably do fairly well in 2014. In other words, we could be looking not at two years of damage control, but sixMore.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Law, Media, Politics, UpdatesDemocrats, Democrats regaining control of Congress, House reapportionment of seats, The House, The SenateRead moreRahm Emanuel leads by a wide margin in the race for the Chicago MayorPoll.January 9, 2011jamesb101No commentsIf he thinks the White House Chief of Staff job was tough..Wait.Emanuel Still Way Ahead for Chicago MayorA newTeamsters/Anzalone Liszt poll in Chicago finds Rahm Emanuel is in a solid lead in the first public poll for the Chicago mayoral race taken since the field has shrunk to four major contenders.Emanuel leads with 42%, followed by Carol Moseley Braun at 26%, Gery Chico at 10% and Miguel Del Valle at 7%..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesPolling, Race for Chiacgo Mayor, Rahm EmanuelRead moreFederal Charges will come in Tucson shooting first..January 9, 2011jamesb101No commentsThe Presser by Mueller and Pima County Sheriff Dupnik also mentions white supremacistgroups for the first time..Mueller: Loughner To Be Charged TodayBrian Beutler | January 9, 2011, 1:13PMAt a press conference in Tucson this morning, FBI Director Robert Mueller announced that the government will file formal charges against Jared Loughner Sunday afternoon.

December saw Richard Michael Daley, the Mayor of Chicago, surpass the term of tenure that his old man Richard Joseph Daley also held forbeing Mayor. Richard Daley was Mayor from 1955 through to the day of his death in 1976. An astonishing reign.Richard Michael Daley has managed to pass that twenty one year stint on December 26th meaning that father and son ruled (and still rule) Chicago for 42 of the last 55 years.The Daley family have had Chicago in a political lockdown for generations. They are a small example of local oligarchies in action.The old boy was accused of being an old fashioned operator, mobilising armies of Union members to force through his point of view. A Democrat National Convention member in 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960 and 1964 Daley made sure that the party and its leaders reflected the Daley view of America..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, UpdatesMayors of Chicago, President Obama, Richard Joeseph Daley, Richard Michael Daley, The Daley Family of Chicago, The Oligarch Kings @ politicaldog101, US Secretary of State, White House and Wall Street, William DaleyRead morePima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the DayJanuary 9, 2011jamesb10113 commentsPima County SheriffClarence W.

Dupnik, who is overseeing the investigation of Saturdays mass shooting that critically wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D), became an overnight sensation with his remarks that the vitriol in todays political discourse contributed to the incident and that Arizona has become a mecca for prejudice and bigotry.Dupniks name wasa top search term on Twitter Saturday night, with many of the tweets thanking him for his candor, and overnight,a Facebook page titled Clarence Dupnik is my Hero sprung up.In a news conference Saturday evening, Dupnik condemned the atmosphere of hatred and bigotry that he said has gripped the nation and suggested that the 22-year-old suspect being held in the shooting was mentally ill and therefore more susceptible to overheated messages in the media.Theres reason to believe that this individual may have a mental issue. And I think people who are unbalanced are especially susceptible to vitriol, he said during his televised remarks. People tend to pooh-pooh this business about all the vitriol we hear inflaming the American public by people who make a living off of doing that. That may be free speech, but its not without consequences.His remarks especially resonated with liberals, who even before the name of the suspect was released suggested that the shooter may have had been incited by the tea party. There is no indication that the suspect, Jared Lee Lougner, identified with the tea party or was politically conservative. During the campaign, liberal pundits and politicians asserted that the sometimes militant language some conservative politicians used could incite violence..MoreOf course the knuckle head GOP Senator Kyl really doesnt get it..Kyl: Arizona Sheriffs Remarks InappropriateBrian Beutler | January 9, 2011, 11:50AMSen.

Sarah PalinAn aide to Sarah Palin claims the crosshairs depicted in her now-infamous target list of Democrats were not actually gun-sights, and that its obscene and appalling to blame Palin for the shooting.We never ever, ever intended it to be gun sights. It was simply cross-hairs like youd see on maps,saidRebecca Mansour on the Tammy Bruce radio show. Moreover, there was nothing irresponsible about the image, and to draw a line connecting Palin and Saturdays shooting is obscene and appalling.You can see the original image below.

Ive polled thousands of high school history teachers and spoken about the war to audiences across the country, and there is little agreement even on why the South seceded. Was it over slavery? States rights? Tariffs and taxes?As the nation begins to commemorate the anniversaries of the wars various battles  from Fort Sumter to Appomattox  lets first dispense with some of the more prevalent myths about why it all began.1. The South seceded over states rights.Confederate states did claim the right to secede, but no state claimed to be seceding for that right. In fact, Confederates opposed states rights  that is, the right of Northern states not to support slavery.On Dec. 24, 1860, delegates at South Carolinas secession convention adopted a Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union. It noted an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery and protested that Northern states had failed to fulfill their constitutional obligations by interfering with the return of fugitive slaves to bondage. Slavery, not states rights, birthed the Civil War.South Carolina was further upset that New York no longer allowed slavery transit. In the past, if Charleston gentry wanted to spend August in the Hamptons, they could bring their cook along. No longer  and South Carolinas delegates were outraged. In addition, they objected that New England states let black men vote and tolerated abolitionist societies. According to South Carolina, states should not have the right to let their citizens assemble and speak freely when what they said threatened slavery.Other seceding states echoed South Carolina. Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery  the greatest material interest of the world, proclaimed Mississippi in its own secession declaration, passed Jan. 9, 1861. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of the commerce of the earth. . . . A blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization.The Souths opposition to states rights is not surprising. Until the Civil War, Southern presidents and lawmakers had dominated the federal government. The people in power in Washington always oppose states rights. Doing so preserves their own..More from the James Loewen piece.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesDSD @PoliticalDog101, Five Myths of the Civil War, James Loewen, Lincoln, Slavery, The Civil War, To Free the Slaves, To keep the Union, Lies My Teacher Told Me"Read moreThe Conservative Constitution of the United States.DSDJanuary 8, 2011jamesb101No comments[as leaked to Prof. David Cole and published surreptitiously in The Washington Post]We, the Real Americans, in order to form a more God-Fearing Union, establish Justice as we see it, Defeat Health-Care Reform, and Preserve and Protect our Property, our Guns and our Right Not to Pay Taxes, do ordain and establish this Conservative Constitution for the United States of Real America.Article I.
