For a moment ortwo.At first, she was very quiet about it, said Leasa Moore, night  manager at Adys Convenience Store & Car Wash on Seltice Way in Post  Falls, where the winning ticket wassold.When Lahti, of Rathdrum, went to the store to check her numbers last  week, the employees took her in the back to tell her shewon.She was calm at first, but in the backroom Lahti could no longer  contain her excitement. She asked if anyone was in the store. When she  was told there wasnt, Moore said she asked, Can Iscream?And scream, shedid.She just had to let it go, Moore said. She was justecstatic.Lahti had let the computer pick the numbers for her, a ticket known as a quickpick.Moore said Lahti, who used to work at a nearby bank, is a regular at the conveniencestore.She comes in at least weekly, she said. She never played the lotto before, from what Iunderstand.Moore described Lahti as a very well-roundedindividual.Shes got a good head on her shoulders, she said. (Shes) very  well put together. I think shell do really well with this. Shell do  goodthings.Idaho Lottery Director Jeff Anderson announced Wednesday Lahti was  the winner of half the $380 million jackpot, the second largest jackpot  in history. The convenience store will receive$50,000.He called Lahti a delightful individual, but said she has asked  for privacy; the lottery isnt releasing any more information abouther.  Lahti turned her winning ticket over to the lottery office in Boise  on Tuesday at the end of the day, and the lottery confirmed that it is  the winner. It hasnt yet paid her, however, Anderson said. She has 60  days to decide whether she wants to take the 26 payments over 25 years,  or the smaller lump sum of $120 million, which would equal $81 million  after state and federal incometaxes.Shes given us an indication that shes willing to talk to the  media when shes got her affairs in order, Anderson said. As you might  expect, theres a lot of things that Ms. Lahti has to get in order.  Theres lots of curious people who want to know who the winner is. This  is a bigdeal. Her name was being provided because it is a matter of public record, hesaid.If Lahti takes the lump sum payment, the state of Idaho will receive $9.36 million in state incometaxes. Anderson said, Once people hear this, Adys is going to become the luckiest place in northernIdaho.And lottery ticket sales have increased there since people found out the winning ticket was sold in Post Falls, Mooresaid.Theyve been buying a lot, she said. I think its probably going to be pretty wild forawhile.Lahti is splitting the $380 million jackpot with an Ephrata, Wash.,  couple, Jim and Carolyn McCullar, who also picked the winning numbers  and came forward lastweek.Katie Stillinger said she worked with Lahti at Inland Northwest Bank  in Post Falls for several years and said Lahti really deserves the  money shewon.Shes a very, very sweet girl. She has a wonderful personality,  said Stillinger, who was a branch manager while Lahti was a teller in  new accounts. She said Lahti is a single mother of two young children.  Shes had a hard time raising them by herself and she will do wonderful  things with (herwinnings).Shes very bubbly and always laughing, Stillinger said of Lahti. Shes always the one that makeseveryonesmile.Staff writers Betsy Z.

Brazil has seen severe flooding in recent years, affecting thousands. Heavy rain began falling again early on Thursday as rescuers  sought to begin their search and is expected to continue throughout much  of the day.Brazil's civil defence department has not yet confirmed the  higher death toll, but officials there have said they believe there  could be hundreds more bodies yet to be recovered in Teresopolis alone,  the Globo media organisation reported.Sixteen more bodies were found in the town early on Thursday,  but the most dramatic rise was in Nova Friburgo, where 48 more people  were reported to have died.'Huge catastrophe'        With many people still missing it is feared the death toll  could rise even further and there is concern about water-borne diseases.More than 800 rescue workers are conducting searches in the  area. The Brazilian navy has offered helicopters to fly in equipment and  personnel.Witnesses said rescue teams were using heavy machinery, shovels and bare hands to dig through tonnes of mud and debris.President Dilma Rousseff is due to fly over the area on Thursday to inspect the damage.Earlier this week, torrential rains in neighbouring Sao Paulo  state left 13 people dead and brought traffic chaos to Brazil's biggest  city.In Teresopolis, a river burst its banks, submerging buildings, while the rainfall set off several mudslides."It's a huge catastrophe, a major disaster," Teresopolis Mayor Jorge Mario Sedlacek told Globo television.TV footage showed homes destroyed and cars submerged."I saw six bodies on my street," 53-year-old resident Antonio Venancio told Reuters news agency.He said his house was inundated with mud but still standing."We just don't know what to do in the face of something so horrible," he addedCivil defence officials in Teresopolis said that in 24 hours  it rained 144mm - more than the usual amount for the whole of January. Power and telephone lines are down in the three towns, and there is no drinking water, officials say.Major roads have been cut by floods and landslides, adding traffic chaos to the challenges facing state officials.One resident described the situation just outside Petropolis as a "sea of mud"."I've lived here 25 years and never seen anything like it," Manoel Candido da Rocha Sobrinho told Folha website."I live in a higher spot but when I look down I just see a  sea of mud. Most people saved themselves by scrambling up trees or  fleeing to higher ground."Just nine months into their romance, Kate Hudson and Matt Bellamy are expecting their first child together.Posted: 2011-01-12 12:07:15 UTC-08:00Just nine months into their romance, Kate Hudson and Matt Bellamy are expecting their first child together.The 31-year-old actress, who has a 7-year-old son Ryder with ex husband Chris Robinson, is said to be 14 weeks along.Her spokesperson confirmed the pregnancy news today.It was not planned, but they are excited and embracing it,' a source tells America's Us Weekly.Growing family: Kate has a son Ryder with her ex husband Chris Robinson'She is happy for Ryder to finally have a brother or sister.'Kate met the Muse rocker, 32, at California's Coachella music festival in  April and they have been virtually inseparable ever since - despite  living on opposite sides of the Atlantic.She introduced him to her mother Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell three months into their relationship.

He was 74 years old. Nelson, best known for starring on his parents' TV hit "The Adventures  of Ozzie and Harriet", passed away on Monday, January 10 at his home in  Los Angeles. He was the last surviving member of the real-life TV family, whose U.S.  sitcom ran on the small screen from 1952 to 1966. Nelson attended the  University of Southern California before convincing his parents to allow  him to act on the show, along with his teen idol brother Ricky. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and racked up a number  of TV and film credits, including roles in "Peyton Place", "The Big  Circus" and "Love and Kisses".

Yes, the owner went to far with his comic sans Ether letter. Yes, the world knows that Lebrons supporting cast, well wasnt very supportive.Currently everything is going well for Lebron there is no need for this:First off never bring God into it, because everyone has  dirt under their fingernails and if God sees all, he is seeing  everything you are doing when you log off twitter. God has giving  Lebron the gift to play basketball, God isnt his personal enforcer  like Sammy the Bull.He is as sensitive and emotional as the fans of Cleveland. They are  both acting like Vince Carter with a minor ankle injury, softer than  Charmin tissue.This is no time to be high horsing if you are Lebron James.  Show  some maturity for once in your life. Because it doesnt matter if the  Heat win 50 games in a row, all that matters is what happens in the  playoffs.Karma works both ways, just remember that King James.Oops, He Did It Again: Jimmer Fredette Goes Off For 47 Points In Win Over UtahPosted: 2011-01-12 03:03:11 UTC-08:00Jimmer Fredette and the BYU Cougars took to the road against conference  rival Utah Tuesday night, and instead of a tough battle on the court,  fans watching the game witnessed a blow-out.Fredette was absolutely on fire early on, capping a 53-42 half-time lead  with a buzzer beater to send both teams into the locker rooms. He then  went on to connect on 16-of-28 shot attempts (six from downtown), while  scoring 47 points, two shy of his career high of 49.This was vintage Fredette, scoring from all over the court, and even  finding the time to get his teammates involved with six assists.Fredette entered Tuesday night's matchup with 24.9 points per game, and  with his 47-point explosion, he's now topped at least 30 points five  times this season, with three of those performances coming in the past  five games.While NBA scouts likely continue to doubt Fredette's overall game and  ability to transition to the NBA level, the BYU product continues to  dazzle, putting on shooting displays seemingly every other game, and  still pitching in double figures in scoring on his "off" game ..."Dirty Jobs'" Mike Rowe made a bit of Thomas Tew RumPosted: 2011-01-12 02:59:05 UTC-08:00"Dirty Jobs'" Mike Rowe made a bit of Thomas Tew Rum  with Newport Distilling Company.

Creator and executive producer Mara  Brock Akil, and husband Salim Akil, who also directs and writes for the  show owe it all to the fans  "We're extremely excited... Mara always says how our other partner is  the fans," states Akil.  He also pointed out that the black community's  been criticized for not using their voice to affect change in the media  and states, "This time, they did."  When it comes to the responsibility  of BET to provide programming that viewers are asking for Akil adds,  "They have."  Creator Brock Akil shares her excitement about the  resurgence of the show and states, "It's a big moment for us, it's a big  moment for BET and for the empowerment of the fans.  They're the ones  who allowed us to stay on as long as we did on the CW."  Brock Akil  tells of how the fans "galvanized" when The Game was coming to  an end on the CW and looked to BET and asked, "What are you going to  do?"  Well BET responded and took over the production of the series and  Brock Akil hopes this will allow more quality black shows to have a home  on the network.  Akil agrees and wants to see a broad range of  programming that resonates within the black community. "I think I would like to see us have the opportunity to be as diverse  as possible.  We're not a monolithic people, and I think that's how we  strike a chord with our viewers.  We try to show all different aspects  of African American people," states Akil.  And in portraying the black  experience Brock Akil had a lot of success captivating a female audience  with Girlfriends, but The Game has now provided an  opportunity to include a male perspective that has been well received  among male fans of the show.  Brock Akil says the secret ingredient of The Game  is the "honest point of view from the women and the men."  And this  approach to creating a great show is part of the reason why Kelsey  Grammer, (of Frasier fame), who many are surprised to learn is also an executive producer of The Game, (and Girlfriends), was happy to get on board to bring quality black programming to television."Kelsey was a smart man at the right time," Brock Akil states.  She  explained that Grammer owned "one of the few production companies that  had a deal with Paramount that had development dollars," to create  shows.  Brock Akil quickly took advantage of this opportunity and  pitched Girlfriends to Grammer, who loved it and was  instrumental in getting the show on the air.  Grammer has been one of  the most silent of "silent partners" in the history of partnerships,  allowing Brock Akil to remain in the forefront of her brainchild.  And  subsequently, Girlfriends and The Game have arguably become two of the most popular and culturally relevant black shows in television history.  This season of The Game will  continue giving viewers what they want by serving up juicy plot lines  that are more emotional intense giving its actors a chance to display  even more range, while preserving its signature quick witted and  sophisticated comedy.  Akil explains that the show is "still funny, but we've always said to  people that it's a 'dramedy'." Akil also credits BET for allowing the  writers and producers the creative freedom to tell the stories in a way  network television didn't provide, bringing more of the original vision  of the show to fruition.  The fans have spoken and fortunately BET has listened.  This season of The Game,  with its cast of characters who engage in career threatening affairs,  reality show shenanigans, paternity tests and "cougar" romances will not  only entertain, but be a testament that the black community does in  fact have a voice and that voice has the power to affect change.

Ted Williams detained by LAPD at Hollywood hotelPosted: 2011-01-11 09:47:02 UTC-08:00Ted Williams, the Ohio homeless man whose golden voice made him a  YouTube sensation and brought him offers of work, was detained by the  Los Angeles Police Department Monday night at a Hollywood hotel.According to law enforcement sources, Williams and a unidentified  family member were detained after police were called to the Renaissance  Hotel on a disturbance call.[Updated at 8:32 a.m.: The sources described the incident as an altercation with his daughter, but declined to provide further details.]Williams was eventually released, and the sources said the  investigation was continuing. The sources stressed it's unclear if any  arrests would result from the probe. Sources spoke on the condition of  anonymity because the case was ongoing.Williams was in Los Angeles for several televisions appearances,  including "Entertainment Tonight." Earlier Monday, he visited the  Lakers."It was good. It was the first time," Kobe Bryant told The Times' sports blog. "I had never seen  him before, but I had heard a lot about him.

Fortunately for him, God doesn't talk back. But Tucson, Arizona residents are thanking whatever deity they believe in that angels don't just talk back, they act. Angels with giant fluffy man made wings standing  around the mourners at funerals, that is. They specialize in funerals  where Phelps and his klan clan of anti-Semitic, homophobic, anti-Catholic, anti-divorce, anti-abortion, anti-Lutheran (seriously, let's just say this guy hates everybody except Arizona shooter Jared Lee Loughner) picketers show up to be giant pains in the tuchas.Hey Mr. Phelps, just go ahead and try picketing the funeral of 9-year-old shooting victim Christina Taylor Green. The angels will be waiting for you. They're part of Angel Action,  a project started informally back in 1998 to protect mourners from  Phelps' band of crazies at the funeral of gay hate crime victim Matthew  Shepard. It's completely grassroots, completely run by the goodness of  people. Volunteers throw on fluffy wings and stand in a close knit  group, the wings providing extra protection to keep the disturbing image  of picketers out of the line of sight of those there to honor the  memory of the deceased.In light of the hatred we saw on Saturday in Tucson; we needed a  miracle of human love. This may be just what the doctor (or God, if you  wish) ordered.Further proof that angels may really exist? Along with these  do-gooders to counteract the evil-doers of Phelps' crew is the  possibility of a "funeral protection zone" being rushed  through the Arizona State Legislature today. Similar to one already in  place in Ohio, it would enable police to keep not just Westboro Baptist  Church members but anyone causing a ruckus back 300 feet  from the people with legitimate business at the funeral. Considering it  usually takes months to get a bill through your standard state  legislature, and they're trying to get this done today, it seems angels really can work miracles.Yesterday, Phelps' announcements that "God sent the shooter" made it painful to believe in HIS God. Today, faith is restored. Do you believe in angels?Ted Williams, 'Golden-Voiced' Homeless Man, Detained In LAPosted: 2011-01-11 09:31:07 UTC-08:00Ted Williams, the "Golden-Voiced Homeless Man" from Columbus, Ohio,  was detained last night by the LAPD. He was at the Renaissance Hotel in  Hollywood with one of his daughters when they both got into a shouting  match with each other. According to TMZ,  a hotel employee called the police, who detained and escorted them both  to the Hollywood LAPD station. The two were later released after both  refused to press charges against each other. Ted Williams is father to  nine children, five of which were raised alone by ex-wife Patricia Kirtley.   Williams, then homeless, was discovered near a Columbus, Ohio highway by a Columbus Dispatch videographer  who captured his "golden voice" on film. Since becoming a YouTube  sensation, Williams has been fielding job offers and appearing on news  and talk shows. LA Times reports that Williams is in Los Angeles because he filmed a visit to the Lakers training facility for Entertainment Tonight.iPhone 4 Launching On Verizon In FebruaryPosted: 2011-01-11 09:28:04 UTC-08:00At a press conference in New York City, Verizon CEO Lowell MacAdam announced that the iPhone 4 will be available on Verizon's network starting February 2011.A 16GB version of the iPhone 4 will cost  $200, with a two-year contract. Apple's smartphone will launch on  Verizon on February 10th of this year, with pre-orders for existing  Verizon customers starting on February 3rd. The Verizon iPhone will  offer a mobile hotspot to which up to five devices can be connected.  However, the iPhone will not run on Verizon's new, ultra-fast 4G LTE  network, and, as with all CDMA phones, users will not be able use data  while on a call, which means no browsing the web while you're talking on  the phone."We've been looking forward to today for a long time," said Apple COO Steve Cook, who joined MacAdam onstage, according to Engadget.MacAdam said,  "Our relationship with Apple has developed over the last two years. In  2008 we started talking about bringing the iPhone to a CDMA network. We  spent a year testing."Critics--among them Verizon rival AT&T--have expressed doubts that Verizon's network has the capacity to withstand the additional burden from millions of iPhone users.Verizon's Dan Dee emphasized the robustness of the network during  "Big Red's" press conference.  "We're ready for this launch," he said.  "Our iPhone 4 customers will get a terrific wireless experience."This is how you open WoW launcher cannot obtain patching information errorPosted: 2011-01-11 09:24:58 UTC-08:00When i open my WoW launcher, it says launcher cannot  obtain patching information.

He made the decision following the weekend shooting in Tucson  that critically injured Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords-D,  killed six and injured 13 others. Representative Giffords was shot in  the head, but is reportedly "holding her own."Chaffetz says he has a Glock 23 and has carried the gun in Utah but  has yet to do so in Washington DC. House member Heath Shuler-D, North  Carolina says he too will be carrying a weapon. Shuler said After the  elections, I let my guard down. Now I know I need to have (my gun) on  me. He received threats in 2009.When asked if members of Congress should carry guns, Chaffetz said it  should be a personal choice. He also reflected on the possibility of  fewer killed and wounded if someone in the crowd had been armed.In response, Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent  Gun Violence said, If hes afraid of the people in his district, I  certainly have no problem with him doing what he needs to protect  himself. I just think he should do more to protect the American people.  James Brady, President Ronald Reagans press secretary, was critically  injured during an assassination attempt on the late president. Chaffetz  represents Utahs third district, which includes parts of Salt Lake  City, Utah County and south central Utah.The alleged shooter, 22 year old Jared Loughner, passed an FBI  background check when he purchased the Glock 19 semi-automatic pistol  with an extended magazine last fall at a Sportsmans Warehouse. There  are questions concerning his mental stability. He will appear in court  today.Jeff Maehl: What Are His Pro Prospects After Last Night's Performance?Posted: 2011-01-11 06:40:16 UTC-08:00Jeff Maehl is a guy who wouldn't crack the starting lineup for most  programs, let alone be the featured receiver but there he was last night  as he helped keep the Oregon Ducks in the game against Auburn in the  national championship.Maehl finished with nine grabs for 133  yards and grabbed the two point conversion that tied the game in the  fourth quarter. It was a great performance by a guy who had been making  plays all year long for Oregon. He's a senior, so he'll be moving on  after the year and now it will be interesting to see what happens to  him.I'm not sure he'll get drafted, but if he does, it will be a  late round pick and he's built in the mold of the scrappy slot receiver  that has become so popular in the NFL. He'll never be the guy who  carries an offense, but in the right system, he can be a handful.Casey Matthews Scouting Report and Player ProfilePosted: 2011-01-11 06:27:22 UTC-08:00If you havent heard of the Matthews family by now, you most likely   live under a rock. Its no secret that they are one of the most dominant   football families to ever play in the NFL.  Clay Matthews Sr. and Clay  Matthews Jr. are the most well known, as  well as Bruce Matthews,  Clay's Jr.'s uncle and one of the best  offensive guards to ever play the  game. Family patriarch Clay Matthews I  was a standout in the 1950s, as  well.While his brother walked  on and under-achieved at USC, Casey wasnt  as fortunate. He was an  undersized 3-star recruit coming out of Oaks  Christian High School,  receiving scholarship offers from numerous  Pac-10 schools as well as a  few medium-range ACC schools. He chose  Oregon in the end, and played in  all 11 games in his freshman year.Casey may not be as  physically gifted as his brother Clay, but  theres no doubt that hes  just as intelligent and has a great work  ethic.Player Name: Casey MatthewsPosition: Inside LinebackerSchool: OregonHeight: 62"Weight: 237  Steve Dykes/Getty Images       StrengthsMatthews biggest  strength is his athleticism. Hes also an extremely  intelligent player  who does well reading and reacting to the offensive  play on every down.  He has a non-stop motor, playing well sideline to  sideline. Hes a  very good tackler whos very fundamentally sound. He  doesnt often get  caught out of position, and he uses his athleticism to  make up for his  lack of overall bulk.Matthews is also excellent in  making plays  in coverage. He covers his zone almost effortlessly, and  has a knack  for finding the ball. Hes an underrated pass rusher on the  inside, and  has the speed to maybe make the transition to the OLB  position in a  3-4, although that may not utilize his skill set to the  maximum.  However, his versatility is fantastic and will be coveted among  teams  in the 2011 NFL Draft.WeaknessesThe  biggest knock on Matthews is his size. Hes not the biggest or   strongest player on the football field. He plays in a very loosely-based   zone defense in Oregon, which helps his athleticism shine. He may not  be  able to transition to a 3-4 defense because of his inability to   frequently get off of blockers. Hes most likely restricted to a 4-3   role, but hes versatile enough to play all three linebacker positions   in a 4-3 scheme.  Steve Dykes/Getty Images       While hes not weak by any means, he still needs to  improve  on his strength and use his arms to get off blocks, rather than  getting  fully engaged with blockers.Draft RangeRight  now, its completely open as to where Matthews goes. His brother,   Clay, had some of the same size weaknesses coming out. But hard work  propelled Clay into the first, and Casey  could do the same if he works  out well enough at the combine. Right  now, his ceiling is as high as a  late first round pick, but hell most  likely be selected between the  middle of the second round and the middle of  the third round.Look  for teams like Indianapolis, Philadelphia, New  Orleans and Detroit to  target Matthews. If teams feel he can make the  transition to 3-4, it  could improve his stock heavily as teams like  Cleveland, Buffalo,  Arizona and Green Bay could look at grabbing him in  the 2011 NFL Draft.Oregon Lost, But Their Cheerleaders Remain UndefeatedPosted: 2011-01-11 06:23:24 UTC-08:00These early morning posts are usually pretty brief, but this one will be  kept even briefer because the remarkable Oregon cheerleaders are visual  storytellers. The Ducks lost to Auburn 22-19, but their vibrant sideline candy brought the pain in the battle of the poon.Michael Dyer Turns in Biggest, and Most Unlikely Play, in BCS ChampionshipPosted: 2011-01-11 03:03:49 UTC-08:00Auburn running back Michael Dyer was down. Oregon defenders stopped running. A couple of Tigers headed back to the huddle.Then -- just like Auburn has done all season, in eight come-from-behind  victories, through the Cecil Newton mess, through everything -- Dyer was  back up.And running.Running across the 50, down the Auburn sideline, for a 37-yard run that was part Barry Sanders and part Tasmanian devil. Five plays later, Wes Byrum  kicked a 19-yard field goal with no time remaining and Dyer was running  again -- onto the field to celebrate the Tigers' 22-19 victory in  Monday night's BCS Championship Game at University of Phoenix Stadium.Tied at 19 after Darron Thomas' two-yard touchdown pass to LaMichael James and Thomas' 2-point conversion pass to Jeff Maehl, the Tigers got the ball at their 25 with 2:27 remaining. Quarterback Cam Newton hit Emory Blake for 15 yards, giving the Tigers a first down at the 40.              So what happened next?Auburn offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn: "He heard us screaming on the  sideline. We were yelling 'go!' There wasn't a whistle. They stopped, we  stopped. And then he went!"Auburn offensive tackle Brandon Mosley: "That was amazing. That was a God thing right there. No doubt about that."Auburn wide receiver Terrell Zachery:  "After the play, I was looking to coach Malzahn to get the next play.  Next thing we know, we look up and we see him take off running. That was  a real heads up play for him being a freshman. That was real smart." Auburn linebacker Craig Stevens:  "I was looking at the Jumbotron, so I missed it. Then I heard the crowd  screaming. I was trying to see what happened. And then I say the replay  and I was like 'run.' "Here's what happened: Dyer ran around right end and was grabbed by Oregon's Eddie Pleasant,  who wrestled him to the ground. However, as they spun toward the  slippery turf, Dyer landed on Pleasant and his knees, shins or elbows  never hit the ground. Dyer than rolled off Pleasant -- in what will be  known forever as the Tigers' most famous roll west of Toomers Corner --  and darted down the sideline."At the time I wasn't really sure (if I was down)," said Dyer, who  finished with 143 yards on 22 carries. "All I knew was the whistle  wasn't blowing and my coach was saying 'go' and I just continued to get  some more yards and keep the play going and keep the ball in the  offense's hands."The last hands to touch the football belonged to senior quarterback Neil Caudle.  He caught a perfect center snap from Josh Harris, set the ball down  inside the 10 as Byrum kicked the football through the uprights that,  ironically, were the same color as Oregon's fluorescent neon yellow  socks."I wasn't nervous," Caudle said. "I was just doing my job. I've been  thinking about this for a long time -- winning a national championship  with a field goal."Meanwhile over in the east stands, Newton waved up into the stands. He  then climbed over the short wall and headed into the stands. He went  past the "Eat More Duck" sign and continued a few rows until he found  his father, Cecil. Cam -- the Heisman Trophy winner -- then celebrated  with the man who the NCAA determined had shopped his son to Mississippi State for $180,000. Auburn center Ryan Pugh, who was down on the field conducting interviews, glanced over and saw the Newton's exchanging a bear hug. "I wish I was up there with Cam and his dad," Pugh said.Newton, who suffered a back injury when he was hit by Oregon's Casey Matthews  in the fourth quarter, returned to the field and minutes later  underwent X-rays for his back. The result of those X-rays was unknown."Cam got dinged up there," Malzahn said. "He said he was all right, but I knew he wasn't. He's a tough, tough guy."Newton, who likely played his final game at Auburn, finished with 265  yards passing and two touchdowns. He also rushed for 64 yards on 22  carries.Inside Auburn's locker room, the celebration carried on. Players posed  for pictures, music pounded off the walls. Former Heisman Trophy winner  Bo Jackson sat in a chair looking on in approval."This is for the players," Jackson told FanHouse. "I'm just here to provide moral support."A few feet away, former Auburn coach Pat Dye talked about Auburn's current coach Gene Chizik."We got a coach here that's out of this world," Dye said. "He did a masterful job."The victory gave the Tigers (14-0) their first national title since 1957  and a fifth consecutive BCS title for the SEC. It was Auburn's first  perfect season since 2004 when the Tigers had to watch USC and Oklahoma  play for the national championship."There's been some great teams that kind of got left out," Dye said.  "This is a glorious day for all us ex-players and ex-coaches and fans --  they've been left hanging ,too. We've had this coming for a long time."FeedBurner delivers the world's subscriptions wherever they need to go. Publish a feed for text or podcasting? You should try FeedBurner today.
