Twenty minutes later, officers were dispatched to the sameapartment in response to a shooting.They arrived to find Smith, Kimberly Deshay Carter, 29, and Barnes Samuel Nettles, 38, dead inside the apartment.City spokeswoman Tiara Richard said it appears that Nettles killed the female officer, his ex-girlfriend, and then took his own life.She said Smith was fatally shot as she tried to shield the 11-year-old daughter of Kimberly Deshay Carter. It was not clear whether the officer was able to discharge her weapon in self-defense.Smith  who was sent to the apartment without a partner  was apparently taking the assault report when Nettles returned to the apartment and opened fire, first at Smith and then at Carter.He then went to the living room of the apartment and apparently took his own life.The 11-year-old-girl was able to escape unhurt.Two weapons were found at the apartment but it was unclear whether Carter fired at her ex-boyfriend.Police said Nettles was a registered sex offender in Arlington for an offense that occurred in Washington state. He had bonded out, and a court date was pending for that incident.After the shootings, the complex was placed on lockdown, so police could sweep all buildings.All entrances to the apartments were blocked and visitors were told to come back in three hours. It was later determined that one of the three victims was the gunman.A fellow officer snapped to a salute early Wednesday morning, as the body of Smith was removed from the upstairs apartment.Smith was born in Arlington and first became interested in law in the sixth grade. She graduated from Seguin High School in 2005, and the University of Texas at Arlington in August 2009, with a Bachelor of Arts in Criminology.Shegraduated from theArlington Police Academy in February and completed herfield trainingon December 13."Her family is very close. Her sister, Jessica, was her best friend," said Arlington police Chief Dr. Theron Bowman."She was a great young lady and an excellent police officer," he added."The only reason she wanted to be a police officer  and the only reason she was at that house last night  was to help people," said Arlington Mayor Robert Cluck. "We feel like our hearts are broken. Our hearts go out to the family."Smith is the eighth Arlington Police Officer to die in the line of duty and the second to die in the line of duty this year.Officer Craig Story was killed in January when his motorcycle struck a school bus about a mile away from Tuesday's shooting scene.Donations for the family of Arlington police Officer Jillian Smith can be made through the Arlington Police Association. Checks should be made payable to "APA Foundation - Officer Jillian Smith," and can be mailed to: Arlington Police Association P. O. Box 27 Arlington, TX 76004Donations can also be made in her name through the Arlington Federal Credit Union (AFCU) at any of the AFCU locations.

I pray for his family too because they didn't ask for it. Have you heard of WOLF in SHIEEP'S CLOTHING. He was a wolf. Men beat their wives and go to church, work, golfing, etc without anyone knowing. All the things he did to this poor lady in the padt is documented. Choking until she's unconcious, pistol-whipping, biting her in the face. I would definately say he HATED her.58292212Flag this commentspelunking said on December 30, 2010 at 10:31 PM@lucmar: I doubt seriously if anyone knowingly and willingly enters any relationship anticipating abuse. I have worked with MANY domestic violence victims and until I did so never realized the intense fear they hold. Not just for themselves but their loved ones as well. Educate yourself rather than pass judgment because with your apparent passion you probably could help save someone's life as a friend, co-worker or even stranger. Kimberly Carter died as a victim of domestic violence, period. To BBOOP13's point, society punishes, ignores or minimizes the outcries of  DV victims. I would very much like to contribute support for both families. I have a brother who is an officer in Seattle, WA. MY heart would grieve deeply as I'm certain Officer Smith's family's does to lose him in the line of duty. Yet her death is not in vain and she proved that by living and dying with honor. Do not dishonor for choosing to do what was right....to serve and protect.58119284Flag this commentbboop13 said on December 30, 2010 at 4:36 PMHow many domestic violence victims call the police over and over and get no protection or hardly noticed until an officer is killed?  Notice how the death of this tortured woman is barely mentioned, just the officer's?  Where is the public funds to help with HER family and burial?  Women can rarely get legal help to get out of these situations and when they try the courts simply tell them "well YOU choose them" as if they were supposed to be psychic and KNOW what the future holds or what is in someone else's mind.  But you never hear someone say tell a wounded officer "well you CHOSE this career"!  Unfortunately in Texas and many other states women and children are still little more than property.  In Texas justice is spelled "JUST US", where one life is far more important than another....

What I think is unfortunate is our law enforcement agencies are not given the benefit of tools in many ways to keep track of problem people wherever they go, deal with the really dangerous ones with effective containment and isolation, and protect both themselves and us in a meaningful way.  Too many politicians, not enough folks with common sense taking care of business.This was a terrible, tragic incident that snuffed the life of a young woman dedicated to serving her community specifically and all of us in general, and the life of the mother of the young girl, who witnessed the entire thing.Very sad.  Very sad indeed.58100127Flag this commentdanta said on December 30, 2010 at 1:22 PMbillytex1, beard was not being serious, he was using an absolute scenario to illustrate a point that a lot of posters are asking for the same sort of conditions as existed in NAZI Germany.

A.) you have NO idea what his offense was or what he's registered for; B.) there are MANY offenders with priors that HAVE rehabilitated, gone back into society, and are living fine, productive lives - I know and have worked with MANY, and your open condemnation is nothing more than a clear sign of your truly limited knowledge of both the true nature of the wide range and individuality of each situation; C) NOTE in the story he HAD YET TO HAVE HIS COURT DATE - he was registered based on an arrest record, which in some states can be done prior to conviction - he was not CONVICTED.I am in NO WAY condoning what occurred, and certainly how he came to be in possession of a weapon is a clear problem - there ARE too many guns out there uncontrolled, and such access needs to be addressed - but DO NOT CONDEMN A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE OF because of the actions of one severely disturbed individual.58096408Flag this commentbeard said on December 30, 2010 at 11:52 AMIf this guy had not been a convicted Sex Offender it would not be so bad. Once again this proves a point ALL SEX OFFENDERS  ARE A THREAT. I don't care if some 18 yr.old kid had sex with his 17 yr. old girlfriend. ALL the same to me he still is a sex offender. And they are all dangerous.  We have a DPS sex offender database.  So we will know where these people live and work.  And they should all be rounded up and put into concentration camps.   It worked for the NAZIS against the JEWS it can work against SEX OFFENDERS.   But as the JEWS had to wear the STAR OF DAVID.  And the SEX OFFENDERS have to register at lease we are in the right direction. PLUS we know if U have been accused of a sex crime u must have done. And the same all sex offenders are guilty no such thing as an innocent register SEX OFFENDER.58092059Flag this commenttruetexan said on December 30, 2010 at 11:43 AMmulligan, do not make excuses for this man.

I read, this woman brought this man here, with her from Washington.  He beat on her there, he beat on her here.  Once you get involved with these psychos, you can't get rid of them, and eventually they kill you.  Officer Smith should not have lost her life, because of such sorry worthless trash as these two.  And don't worry about him answering to God, where he's at, there is no God.  Officer Smith, may you always be remembered for the good person, that you were.58078584Flag this commentzivkam said on December 30, 2010 at 7:17 AM@ufo820:  Used to bashing DPD much??  Arlington PD and see my previous post about sending a "rookie" @steven75150:  You're asking for a criminal justice system like what they had in the USSR.  You really want to give up your rights??       All of you please remember that the only eye witness to this massacre was the poor 11 year old child.  The detailed explaination of what occurred came mostly from the memory of the child who had to relive the murder of her mother and Officer Smith by the hand of someone familiar to her.  Remember her in your prayers as she will be haunted by this horrible crime for the rest of her life.58077452Flag this commentzivkam said on December 30, 2010 at 7:03 AMYa'll need to ride along with your local police agency and see how it really works. On in-progress calls like disturbances, thefts, burglaries, robberies, alarms, fights dispatchers will "dispatch" at least two. For report calls where the crimes are delayed, dispatchers only send one. If there was information that a suspect is still close they will dispatch two, but the officer ultimately has the option to disregard their cover. It happens every day in almost every department. 99% of the time if the suspect of the crime left, they will not return if they know the police have been called and are on their way. Every call is different, every response is different. That's what makes it such a dangerous job. To say Officer Smith wasn't ready to be on her own is an injustice to her.  She may not have had the experience of other officers in years, but she had the same training and was deemed fit to be on her own. Of all the choices she could have made, protecting the child was a good one.58077091Flag this commentlp1111 said on December 30, 2010 at 12:22 AMrmparton. I don't know if you are replying to my post, but I never said domestic assault wasn't a violent crime.  I also never said I agreed with ArIington's policy.  I just said that apparently they didn't view the two kinds of domestic problems in the same light.  Yes, I agree that the dispatcher should take these kinds of situation seriously, but that doesn't mean they will or that they will see the danger in not handling it properly.  There are probably many people who don't understand the horrors and dangers of domestic violence.  Even some police or public officials don't seem to get it, and so it isn't automatic that they will just see the danger.  I'm not saying it shouldn't be automatic, but we are dealing people.  People don't always see the dangers in a situation.  This is even true when the people involved should see and know that situation could be dangerous.58071474Flag this commentmilitarybrat2005 said on December 30, 2010 at 12:04 AMi graduated with this officer.. she was a really nice girl.. not judgemental like everyone else.. i pray for the best for her family.. and i hope that man had a good excuse when he faced God... i wish they hadnt sent her alone.. this incident could have been prevented.. then again if noone had responded then an 11 yr old could be dead as well..and rejco... get over yourself...58071248Flag this commentsteven75150 said on December 29, 2010 at 11:57 PMsince he had an extensive violent history,  why was he even out on the streets?same old story,,  he had rights, the system it too liberal, crimes of violence should be lifetime of incarceration. death of two women could have been avoided.I guess if the judges or law makers family had been affected by this piece of trash, the garbage human would have not been let out in the first place.58071144Flag this commentrejco100 said on December 29, 2010 at 11:50 PMThis homicidal child rapist is free to roam the streets WHILE YOU PEOPLE ALLOW homeless veterans to rot in your HORRIFYING jails for the crime of BEING HOMELESS & SLEEPING OUTSIDE....ABSOLUTELY INSANE!RELEASE THE HOMELESS VETERANS & LOCK UP THESE SICK CHILD RAPISTS!58070969Flag this commentufo820 said on December 29, 2010 at 11:00 PMWhat an evil man,  And DPD come on,  Sending a rookie alone?58069741Flag this commentrmparton said on December 29, 2010 at 9:07 PMDomestic assult is not considered a violent crime?  Baloney, if this has been Arlington SOP, you can rest assured that it will change shortly.  I don't care if it's a jaywalking complaint, common sense says you don't send a rookie and you don't send ANYONE alone.  It makes no difference what the victim told them, anyone who has dealt with these situations knows that the perp is unstable and the victim tends to dwon-play their own peril to the point that, historically they speak in defense of the punk who has just assaulted them.  It is the PD's responsibility to act professionally and they smooched the pooch badly with this one.  APD heads should roll over this one.58066037Flag this commentlp1111 said on December 29, 2010 at 8:47 PMIt was a domestic assault call.  Apparently this is not viewed the same as a domestic violence call where the victim is still on the premises.  Apparently he wasn't, but returned later. I don't know what the levels are for this kind of thing, but apparently there are different levels of perceived danger.  She came to take a report, and the man apparently wasn't there.  If they had thought he was, they would probably have handled it different.  Also, you have to remember that the dispatcher might only have had the information given to him by the assault victim.  The assault victim might have implied that there was no danger of him returning or that she didn't feel like her life was in danger.58065479Flag this commentimpala07 said on December 29, 2010 at 8:30 PMmy prayer go out to the familys58064999Flag this commentvidkid said on December 29, 2010 at 8:24 PMHope this man rots in hell!58064837Flag this commentrmparton said on December 29, 2010 at 8:14 PMDid this start out as a domestic violence call?

And, muligan, if he truly was a known sex offender, he should have been removed from society long ago.  Those people NEVER rehabilitate, they just lie in wait for their next victim/victims.

My heart aches for the officer and her family. Even if the domestic altercation occured earlier and she was just taking a report someone should have been with her. She was  a rookie for crying out loud. DOMESTIC VILOLENCE is the most dangerous calls. Officers on vacation or whatever.....she shouldn't have been alone on this call. Lord please give her family and friends peace. MEN..... if someone leaves you it is NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. Men out number women by a lot. You can alwways find someone else. This type of violence is senseless. If anyone knows of a family member that is troubled because of a broken relationship.PLEASE talk to them, take them to get help. Don't just ignore it. 9 times out of 10 they are talking to someone about their problems.58039137Flag this commentbleeker said on December 29, 2010 at 11:28 AMI find it disappointing that people without all of the facts and who aren't in law enforcement are questioning the officer's actions and/or placing blame on the APD.  As another news station reported and a previous poster mentioned, this was not a domestic disturbance in progress and the suspect was not on scene when the officer was dispatched.  In such cases, it is very common for officers to respond to the scene without a backup.  Why don't we put the blame where it solely belongs in this case?  On the suspect.  My sincere condolences to Officer Smith, her family and the APD.58038983Flag this commenttexican24 said on December 29, 2010 at 11:07 AMI guess APD will take domestic violence calls more seriously NOW!!! Too late for Ms Smith....may she rest in peace. And I agree....this is on APD!!!58037644Flag this commentsonnee said on December 29, 2010 at 10:50 AM@deeda - I was thinking the same thing. Those types of calls can be so volatile, why send a rookie alone?58036554Flag this commentdeeda said on December 29, 2010 at 10:42 AMMy condolences to her family, but I'm concerned as to why she was alone as a rookie and sent on such a call.  Mayor Bob Cluck was on the radio this morning and said the domestic violence calls are among the most dangerous.58036134Flag this commenttomalciere said on December 29, 2010 at 10:41 AMThere is no such thing as a good cop. During the Revolutionary War there weren't "good" and "bad" Redcoats. Everybody knows we're living in a police state. In a police state, the police are the enemy, so by definition police officers are enemy officers. keithstone said on December 29, 2010 at 10:27 AMSo sad when we lose a good one.58036031Flag this commentfeduptxgranny said on December 29, 2010 at 10:41 AMThis is just sickening.

The story is that this was not a domestic violence situation in progress. The event had already occurred and the ex wife wanted to file a report and press charges. The ex husband had left at that time. He returned at the same time as the officer and apparently ambushed her. May she and the ex wife RIP, the ex husband can burn in hell.58025813Flag this commentkatz10101 said on December 29, 2010 at 7:41 AMMy deepest sympathy and prayers go out to the family and fellow officers for the untimely death of this brave young woman.
