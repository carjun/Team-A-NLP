Do a web-search for the "falsely imprisoned". I hope you have plenty of time to kill. If you're like our law enforcers and courts- there isn't much time. There isn't much time for getting at the truth. It's an assembly line. It's an ATM for lawyers and judges. And you fellow Americans will pay and pay. No, you may not care now. It's not your turn in front of the "Injustice System"!Do people who have been unlawfully convicted andfalsely imprisoned have the right to a civil remedy? If no, why not? If yes,who pays? Are judges and prosecutors in a court withsubject matter jurisdiction immune from civil liability under all circumstancesno matter how outrageous their conduct, without exception? Bill O'Reilly says!!! The Factor is the only news program in the country holdingAmerican judges responsible for their behavior, the only one.""That means judges often get away with outrageous sentences and courtroomshenanigans because we can't be everywhere. And when judges do misbehave, theyhide behind the, We can't talk about the case ruse. So they're not heldaccountable to anyone. This must stop.Maryland Judge Joseph Manck is aperfect example of what I'm saying. Earlier this year Manck sentenced a brutalchild molester, a man who sexually abused his eight-year-old daughter for sevenyears to just four months in jail. That is a totally irresponsible sentence." The system is full of flaws in falsely imprisoning as well. Ask these folks below.Greg Taylor Greg Taylor-17yearsGreg Taylor wasconvicted of murdering Jacquetta Thomas, a woman he had never met. He swore hisinnocence from the start, but every appeal failed. Taylor got a break, when a novelfact-finding agency called the N.C. Innocence Inquiry Commission recommendedhis case to a three-judge panel for further review. The judgesdeclared him innocent and set him free. He was the first prisoner in the nationto earn his freedom through such a process. He had spent 17 years longing for his home and family. BY MANDY LOCKE - Staff Writer mandy.locke@newsobserver.comMan Falsely Imprisoned for 24 Years Seeks Damages Thomas Lee Goldstein files claims that allege misconduct by police andprosecutors.Los AngelesApril 22, 2004|Henry Weinstein, Times Staff WriterAttorneys for Thomas Lee Goldstein, who spent 24 years in prison for amurder he did not commit, announced Wednesday that they had filed damageclaims, alleging that police officers and prosecutors had committed egregiousacts of misconduct that cost the Vietnam veteran the prime years ofhis life."For the police to fabricate evidence and use perjured testimony toachieve their conviction" was an "egregious affront" toGoldstein and the Constitution that calls for compensation, said Ronald O.Kaye, Goldstein's attorney, at a Pasadenanews conference.Rick Walker Tainted Trials, Stolen JusticeAn East Palo Alto auto mechanic will receive $2.75 million to settle alawsuit that accused Santa ClaraCounty authorities ofoverzealous prosecution in a controversial murder case that stole nearly 12years of his life.Attorneys for the county and Rick Walker, who served 12 years in prison fora murder he didn't commit, said the settlement received final approval from thecounty's insurance carrier Friday.Walker, who has worked as a mechanic since winning his freedom in 2003, saidhe won't consider the case settled until the money is deposited to his bankaccount. But he also said he hopes the settlement will be "like a pebblethrown in the water" that has a "ripple effect" in preventingfuture abuses by law enforcement authorities."There's a lot more people like me that are not as fortunate as I am,that are still in prison for things they didn't do," said Walker, 51. "So ultimately, if thispebble in the water makes the county change what they are doing, that's a goodthing."Walker's 1991 conviction in the slaying of a Cupertino woman cameafter a trial that relied in part on testimony from a onetime co-defendantwhose statements were later discredited. It was only after a friend of Walker's family developednew evidence that then-District Attorney George Kennedy decided to reopen thecase in 2003.The co-defendant and another man were eventuallyconvicted in the case. ByBrandon BaileyMercury News Evidence exonerates 328, but many still falsely imprisonedExonerations of defendants convicted of serious crimes more than tripledduring the past 15 years as DNA and other new evidence overturned theconvictions, a U-M study shows.The study, "Exonerations in the United States, 1989 through 2003," includes what isbelieved to be the most comprehensive listing of exonerations in the United Statesto date. It was conducted by law Professor Samuel Gross and four students. Thestudy reports that since 1989when the first DNA exoneration occurred328defendants have been exonerated in the United States after being convictedof serious crimes such as rape and murder.The exonerated were 316 men and 12 women; 145 of them were cleared by DNAidentification technology, and 183 by other kinds of evidence. Exonerationsincreased sharply from about 12 a year through the early 1990s to an average of43 annually after 2000, the study found. The study did not include at least 135additional innocent defendants who were framed by rogue police officers andcleared within the last five years in two mass exonerations in California and Texas."The most important findings of our study concern the cases that wedon't seemiscarriages of justice that are not detected," says Gross, anexpert on criminal procedure and capital punishment. "The exonerations wesee are just the tip of an iceberg. It is clear that there are many more falseconvictions that are never discovered."The research indicates that the justice system must continue to improve itsinvestigative methods to reduce the number of convictions of innocent people,Gross says. The study focuses on three common causes of false convictions:misidentifications, false confessions and perjury.According to Gross, police should implement different tactics to reduce thedanger of false convictions based on different types of faulty information. Forinstance, convictions based on false confessions could be reduced greatly byvideotaping police interrogations so judges and juries can see for themselvesthe circumstances that led the defendant to confess, he says.Another key finding in the research involved racial disparities in thejuvenile justice system. Ninety percent of exonerated juvenile defendants areAfrican American or Hispanic.The students participating in the research were Kristen Jacoby and DanielMatheson, Law School; Nicholas Montgomery, LSA's Department of Economics andFord School of Public Policy; and Sujata Patel, School of Public Health.May 18, 2004By Jared WadleyNews Service James WoodardJames Woodard is now 55 years old and he spent more time in prison than anyother wrongfully convicted inmate in U.S. history. It is anunforgivable record. Mr. Woodard said he intends to help the Innocence Projectof Texas, which worked to release him from prison, however he can now that heis finally out of jail."Unfortunately, you're notgetting justice today," State District Judge Mark Stoltz told Mr. Woodard."You're getting the end of injustice." DNA testing freedWoodard a full 27 years and four months after being wrongly convicted finallyexonerated him.***"After a careful review of the files in this case by our ConvictionIntegrity Unit, it is apparent that James Woodard did not have a fair trialback in 1981 and the results of his post-conviction DNA test exclude him as theperpetrator of any sexual assault that may have occurred, making him eligiblefor bond while we finalise our investigation on this case," Dallas CountyDistrict Attorney Craig Watkins said in a news release."I thank God for letting me live through the experience," said Mr.Woodard. "I never learned to give up, especially when I'm right."According to the Innocence project, Woodard now becomes the 18th person in DallasCountyto have his conviction cast aside with the assistance of DNA test results thatproved their innocence.By GeneByrdMay 1, 2008Jeffrey Dicks Jeffrey Dicks, the son of an impoverishedTennessee Mother, languished on death row for a robbery he didn't commit and amurder he didn't even see.... the tense, personal highlymoving true story of the bloody crime of which eighteen yearoldJeffrey was accused.

He got into the nitty-gritty details of cases, and when he began to believethat somebody was wrongfully convicted he wouldnt stop until he got justice, Mr. Scheck said Monday.Justice from the Fourth Estate has always been a great safety valve of ourlegal system, and Pete Shellem was that safety valve in Pennsylvania.In one case, a man who was a teenager when he was convicted of killing aneighbor was released after 28 years in prison. In another,DNA evidence that Mr. Shellemrecovered from a professors refrigerator in Leipzig, Germany,exonerated a retarded man of rape and murder.Steven Crawford was arrested in 1970, when he was 14,after a friend was bludgeoned to death with a hammer. In 2001, Mr. Shellem learnedthat an old briefcase had been found in the attic of a deceased detective whohad worked on the case. Notes in the briefcase suggested that a state policechemist had altered laboratory results to help convict Mr. Crawford. TheDauphin County District Attorneys Office supported Mr. Crawfords releaseafter 28 years in prison.In 1988, Barry Laughman, a man with an IQ of about 70, was sentenced to lifein prison for the rape and murder of a distant relative, Edna Laughman. Fifteenyears later, Mr. Shellems series in The Patriot-News pointed to flaws in thecase, including a confession that appeared to have been coerced. He alsotracked down microscope slides of semen recovered from the victims body thathad been taken to Germanyby a professor who had tried, but failed, to identify the DNA. DNA techniquesthat had improved since the trial showed that Mr. Laughman was not the killer.He was freed in 2003. In the Laughman case, Pete was beating his head against the wall for yearsand no one would listen to him, Bill Moushey, director of the Innocence Institute of Point Park University in Pittsburgh,said Monday. Some law enforcement people brought personal attacks against him,trying to debunk his work, but he stood strong and eventually that retarded kidwalked out of prison.Among the other prisoners freed by Mr. Shellems investigations is DavidGladden, who was convicted in 1995 of killing a 67-year-old woman, Geneva Long,and burning the body. Ten years later, Mr. Shellem discovered that a convictedserial killer had lived next door to Ms. Long; he had killed his known victimsin the same way. Mr. Shellem interviewed a witness who had testified that he was with Mr.Gladden at the time of the crime. The witness recanted, saying he had beencoerced into confessing a role in the crime. Mr. Gladden walked out of prisonon Feb. 16, 2007. I dont start writing until Im sure Im right, Mr. Shellem told TheAmerican Journalism Review, and if people need to be embarrassed into doingthe right thing, Im happy to oblige them.Peter Joseph Shellem was born in Philadelphiaon Oct. 6, 1960, one of five children of Harry and Josephine Shellem. Besideshis son Philip, he is survived by his wife of 24 years, the former Joyce Elser;another son, Alek; a brother, Paul; and a sister, Karen Cain.Mr. Shellem graduated from Temple University with adegree in journalism in 1983. While in college, he worked at The DelawareCounty Times. He was a reporter for The Mercury, in Pottstown, Pa.,before being hired by The Patriot-News in 1986.A bearded, barrel-chested man, Mr. Shellem could have been cast as a B-moviereporter. He knew the first names of many bartenders in Harrisburg. He would sit in a bar poring overcourt transcripts and interviewing sources.I dont want to lead anyone to believe I go to bars only to get stories,he once said, although it would be nice if my editors did.Peterson is still a prosecutor in Oklahoma. Exonerated Wrongfully Imprisoned Sued By ProsecuterKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A local man who spent 11 years in an Oklahoma prison for a murder he did notcommit is now being sued by the prosecutor who put him behind bars.Dennis Fritz was exonerated in 1999. Last year, Fritzpublished a book called "Journey Toward Justice" about hisexperience. The book pulled no punches about the prosecutor in his case, KMBC'sMartin Augustine reported.But the prosecutor said Fritz got it wrong, and is takinghim to court again for libel."It's just totally ridiculous," Fritz said.Fritz told Augustine that he believes the lawsuit is less aboutthe law and more about the heat his book is bringing down on his prosecutorBill Peterson.Augustine reported that the story details Fritz and hisfriend, Ron Williamson, co-defendants in the case, who were wrongly convictedon bad evidence for the slaying of Debra Sue Carter. DNA later proved that theydid not do it.With another man now in prison for the crime, Fritz said hefinds it strange that the prosecutor wants him to pay for his account of those11 years."He's actually going to try and sue me for punitivedamages, monetary damages from the man that he falsely convicted. It's totallyinsane," Fritz said.Best-selling author John Grisham wrote a book of his ownaccount of the case, focusing on Williamson. But Grisham spent a lot of timeinterviewing Fritz, even warned him that their books might prompt a lawsuit.Augustine reported that Peterson's lawsuit argues that hedid the best he could with the murder case based on the available evidence.Peterson is also suing Grisham, saying in court papers that the books by Fritzand Grisham have maligned him.Peterson is still a prosecutor in Oklahoma.Las Cruces Magistrate Court Crooked Cop Stupid Judge  Police Brutality Compilation - Extremely Disturbing Mark Clavarella Judges Sold Children Into SlaveryTwo Pennsylvania Judges JailedMark Clavarella and Michael Conahan, judges from Luzerne County in Northeastern Pennsylvania admitted to making more than 2.5 million dollars by selling children into prison. For at least 4 years, the judges took money from 2 privately operated children's prisons in exchange for imprisoning children in the prisons.This is an example of why private prisons are so bad and why contracting with private firms to imprison people is so very bad.These "private" prisons were so terrible after the Civil War and during "Reconstruction" that life for former slaves was worse than slavery to many.Albert SaboAlbert Sabo is a runt.  He's a runt both in body and spirit.  In January 1998 Philadelphia finally rid itself of his blight.  He was a judge for 25 terrible years.  He liked to sentence black men to die.  During his career he gave 27 black men death sentences.  To round it out a little, he also sentenced 4 whites to die."The Pennsylvania Supreme Court also dismissed the testimony of Philadelphia court stenographer, Terri Maurer Carter who overheard Mumia's original trial judge, Albert Sabo, state in his antechamber in  relation to Mumia's case, "Yeah, and I'm going to help 'em fry the nigger."Judge Michale JoyceJudge Michale Joyce has been indicted for a slew of lies and defraudingtwo insurance firms out of almost half a million dollars. Thefeds had to bring the indictment because Pennsylvania's courtsare so corrupt that they can't be trusted to weed out even themost corrupt judges.Judge Pazuhanich  I'm a Pennsylvania attorney who had the utter displeasure ofdealing with former Monroe County District Attorney Pazuhanich.He has since become a judge and been been charged with sexually molesting his 10 year-old relative. Debra Schmidt CaseDebra Schmidt Case, Alameda County, California. Aconvicted sex offender, an illegal immigrant, a man who molested his niecein front of his wife, raped his wife in front of one of his daughters,and later molested another child, Manuel Saavedra, received custody ofhis young daughters, but their mother, Debra Schmidt, was arrested andcharged with kidnapping.Ultimately, after six years (nearly half of cognizant childhood), Schmidtregained custody.Wendy TitelmanWendy Titelman Case  Cobb County, Georgia. WendyTitelman is the mother of two daughters who wrongfully were taken fromher by a Georgia judge September 15, 2000, and turned over to theirfather after the children claimed he had sexually abused them, and theirmother reported this abuse. Their mother was jailed. Months later, thecriminal jury was so outraged that after acquitting Titelman, they tookit upon themselves to write a letter of complaint to JudgeJames Bodiford and the responsible DistrictAttorney who had brought the charges. But it was to no avail: in all thetime since, Wendy Titleman has not had her children returned to her.            "Medical and mental healthexperts confirmed the abuse. Claudine DombrowskiClaudine Dombrowski Case, Shawnee County, Kansas.Claudine lost custody of her baby daughter Rikki to Hal Richardson, theman who did this, thanks to JudgeJames P. Buchele, who refused to permitadequate testimony at trial, shortening it to benefit his docket, and alsoordered Claudine to move back to Topeka to live near Richardson, for thesake of their "co-parenting." WHAT?! Richardson is a man withmultiple criminal convictions for violent behavior (Battery, AttemptedBattery, Battery of a Law Enforcement Officer, Obstruction of Legal Process, violation of Open Container law), a man whohas beaten and raped Claudine multiple times before and after her divorcefrom him, a man who has threatened to kill her and her child. This is a never ending HUB! Americans, the citizens of the United States of Apathy consider America fine. The Injustice System of the US is the best so it needs no repair.

The farmer said "There might be a problem; you see, I only haveroom for two to sleep, so one of you must sleep in the barn." "No problem," said the Rabbi, "My people wandered in the desertfor forty years, I am humble enough to sleep in the barn for an evening."With that he departed to the barn and the others bedded down for the night.Moments later a knock was heard at the door; the farmer opened the door, therestood the Rabbi from the barn. "What's wrong?" asked the farmer. He replied, "I am grateful to you , but I can't sleep in the barn. Thereis a pig in the barn and my faith believes that is an unclean animal." HisHindu friend agrees to swap places with him. But a few minutes late the samescene reoccurs. There is a knock on the door,"What's wrong, now?" the farmer asks. The Hindu holy man replies, "I too am grateful for your helping us out butthere is a cow in the barn and in my country cows are considered sacred. Ican't sleep on holy ground!" Well, that leaves only the lawyer to make the change. He grumbled andcomplained, but went out to the barn. Moments later there was another knock on the farmers door. Frustrated andtired, the farmer opens the door, and there stood the pig and the cow The biggest problem I have with these PESTS is that they will not clean up after themselves.They will not police themselves.They perpetuate a terrible, terrible system that is indeed their own ATM machine! Lawyer: "Judge, I wish to appeal myclient's case on the basis of newly discovered evidence." Judge: "And what is the nature of the new evidence?" Lawyer: "Judge, I discovered that my client still has $500 left." One federal judge got arrested for driving drunk while dressed in drag.  Others stood accused of frequenting prostitutes, a strip club and a shady escort service; sexually assaulting female court employees; sucker-punching a stranger; or slapping a spouse. Federal judges have made illegal campaign contributions, falsified court records, and illegally concealed cash gifts and gambling debts.  Many more have engaged in unethical or irresponsible acts, according to an investigation by the Houston Chronicle of more than 3,000 judicial misconduct matters nationwide and analysis of related records over 10 years. Most get away with it. Only seven judges in the last decade have faced formal disciplinary action as a result of the nation's secretive misconduct review process. In that same period, citizens filed more than 6,000 formal misconduct complaints, the Chronicle found. Lines In The SandLines In The SandTheres a line drawn in the sand.

Just trust in justice." Our justice system would be fantastic if it worked the way it is supposed to work. I have taught my kids to show respect to police officers, though they have been let down by them on a couple of occasions and have already developed a sad cynicism.[I know there are great police officers out there and I am grateful for them!] Then, they get to hear about people who get slapped on the wrist for rape, severe assault and pedophilia and gasp when they find out about people who either did nothing or did something ridicilously trivial being sentenced to the max by the courts.  Patriotic Americans need to pay attention. Thanks for the long, informational and interesting hub.Micky Dee9 months ago How so very true iskra. They are people. Very fallible-especially when they're drenched in power. People think they are free. Not while so many suffer.Micky Dee9 months ago Hi SEO IT! I, you, we, love good policemen and public servants who truly dispense justice equally. We have no reason to have a beef if it were done consistently so. Perhaps justice is dispensed more equally where there is more viability and on matters that don't matter.I say this all the time-I was in Vietnam, my uncle and Father were in the military in WWII. My great-uncle was in the military in WWI. My grand-nephew is in Afghanistan. We have defended this country for a century. We have no problems with authorities who have the general welfare of our citizens at heart. No-one can explain what the hell Vietnam was about but it's documented that the LIE of the Gulf of Tonkin got us fully militarily in Vietnam. Now evidence of corruption is drowning us. Most of America professes to be Christian. OK Christians- what are you going to do? Most of the religious of one type or another outnumber non-believers 3 to 1. OK believers- what are you going to do?Sorry SEO IT! I get lost in trying to help a world correct itself when the world is actually defeated and down for the last count.Jesus said to pray:Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven...This means we are to pray that this world is to resemble heaven.Apparently religious think that there will be wars, corruption, bad cops, bad, congressmen, bad judges....Our religious are defeated- evidently? This is THE prayer to pray. Jesus said so. He said "pray like this".But alas- I will be told that "there will always be wars and rumors of wars". So we will kill each other for eternity? Are we to be fatalists and give in to "there will always be wars and rumors of wars"?Is it "wars" or is there hope? "thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven..."We are told to pray this. It's okay to pray this if you are of another religion.

Our judicial system is a mockery and there is no fairness in it.I remember a lot of the cases you pointed out (I'm a crime buff amongst other things)and it irriates me to no end when after a wrongly imprisoned person is released with indisputed proof, the DA's never ever admits any wrong doing.Charges need filing,butts need firing and imprisonment.  How these public servants can sleep at night after contriving a conviction of an innocent person is beyond me.The real criminal is merrily going about their business committing even worse criminal acts.

That would have been a dozen years ago but I would feel safe saying it hasn't gotten much better.  We kill everyone here, even low IQ or crazy, but mostly we kill blacks.  Death penalty needs to be abolished and justice needs to become justice instead of how much money or status do you have.Excellent hub~If you check a Hub called "anyone remember this", it will give you some insight into the British justice system and stray Irishmen.Micky Dee9 months ago Thank you Iunn.

Too many folks are mesmerized by their own "holiness" than to care about the falsely accused and suffering. The injustice system has caused more suffering than 911. Allow me to add that 911 sucks and I mean it -but someone will take my words and say "well there you are, he can't love the Lord". Meanwhile they can't get out of their own holiness to give a flip about their brothers and sisters being imprisoned for nothing. Shame!Iunn9 months ago Don't worry about what moronz say about you.  Yeah, our nation is ripe with hypocrisy, the 'christin nation' indeed lol, and I've hubbed to that too.  I go off on political bents to the point that people beg for my poetry as a break which is quite a feat :p  I've deleted tons of old news, I used to have upwards of 250 Hubs.However, the politically dumbed down and morally corrupt have been safe from my scathing typing for quite some time.  I've had other stuff to do and I'm pretty close to debated out.  Nice to see others pick up the torch.Oh and if you missed it in the comment, I agree with your comment.  :)Micky Dee9 months ago You know Iunn- there are a few things that I have to be proud of. Pride goes before the fall but-First, I am proud that I went to Vietnam. Yes Vietnam was started by an out right lie with the Gulf of Tonkin mess. But I fought for this country. I did without for years of service. I went to a war zone. I stood up for what I was led to believe was right. I did what I had to do. I was as I needed to be to help my fellow Marines get the hell out of there.Second, I am proud I went to an American County Chain Gang for something I didn't do. This by God gives me credibility over a whole bunch of false prophets. Maybe not to many people but most importantly to me. I see so much doodoo cocka in our country. Do I have the right to say it? By God if I don't who does? I've seen the lies of my country America and the people of this nation are not right with God or there would have been a revolution already. And no I'm not calling for violence because that is just what Satan does best!Thirdly I love God. I love a benevolent God. If God is not benevolent then that spirit would be evil. I love good. I love God. I know that a perfect man lived. I know his friends ran off.I'm proud I love God. I love good. It's an uphill battle trying to rouse true morality into your fellow man. It seems fruitless. The people on planet Apathy have to evolve. They keep killing and looking the other way.Thanks Iunn. I appreciate you.Iunn9 months ago I appreciate you right back, particularly after that comment.  On false prophets, I did something on that called "five" about guyana and vietnam.  You might want to read it, it's blessedly short.I agree all points.  I dated Vietnam vets and I saw the damage done from that war and I was against the war but never against our soldiers.  I was FOR our soldiers.I have considerable sympathy for the falsely accused and imprisoned, in particular because of Irish politics but I have activated on it here too, especially for increased safety for all inmates in Texas prisons.  A prison sentence is just that, a time sentence.  It should not include assault, rape or AIDS as 'extras'.I love God too, and mine's benevolent.  I'm a Catholic leftist.  Pretty rare stuff in my area which is Baptist Bible Belt and right-wing.Apathy, I could make a Hub on, but I'd prefer to see you do it.  :DAnd I appreciate you, too. :)  Oh, and you have the right to say pretty close to anything you want here.  You bled for that right for all of us.  Of course that means they have that same right, but then, not all opinions are equal. ;)creativeone599 months ago Thank you Micky for a great hub, I understand now why Justic is blind, it's really sad that all of those people suffer wrongfully. thank you for sharing. Godspeed. creativeone59Ghost Whisper 779 months ago UGH! This whole hub just piz'z me off Mickydee. Yup. I know about a corrupt justice system because I have dealt with it first hand-had a woman twice my size-threaten my children-call them racial slurrs-threaten to kick their azz'z-in MY PARKING LOT in front of MY HOME and infront of terrified children! She proceeded to threaten me with bodily injury-called me C word-went to hit me in face-of course I know how to bob and weave since childhood--I defended myself and my children. (yes-I admit I gave satan a slap down) I was the one that got arrested! CORRUPT!Another woman harrassed and stalked me-threatened me-called me-did horrible things-told people she was me-used my name-YIKES-guess what..I got a knock on my door after 4 months of these things and I had a warrant for MY arrest! Inside the warrant paperwork--everything this person did to ME--but switched it to my name(you want to talk about going biserk?)....CORRUPT. Arrested again!Had my ex tear up my cars-physically hurt and abuse me-kidnap-steal my cards and money-keep me trapped-when I got away guess what? He filed with social services-said I was a crack head and abused my children-even used some of the torment he used upon me and my children. They interogated my children and me forever about a fictious man who he entered into paperwork! He got off scott free! I dealt with him stalking-ruining my vehicles-getting in my homes-tormenting me and children for years and years! CORRUPT SYSTEM!!I could get into the military lies and corruption..yup arrested after 5 woman jumped me! I got arrested-the perpetrators did not-5 of them got off scott free and they were directed to jump me by the Masters-at-arms (military police)...lovely and CORRUPT.Okay..I will stop now..because their is NO JUSTICE DOWN HERE! NONE! And now--Got a SS NAZI LANDLORD under a U.S. alias-people threatening me because I know the truth-but they are the good guys huh? CORRUPTION!!THERE IS NO JUSTICE BUT GOD'S JUSTICE!!! Whew--I have to go away--just the thought of this whole hub-and just the FEW expierences I have shared...I am going to have a head explosion! lolMicky Dee9 months ago Hi again Iunn. It is overwhelming. There is too much cruelty. I appreciate your writing about atrocities- in prison, Ireland, and wherever they occur. These may not be "huggie" hubs.I guess they won't get the hits they deserve. Maybe not enough people will write their own. But those that do and will are basic threads of humanity. We have to. Thank you Iunn. I'll be oveer your way to read more of your stuff very soon.Micky Dee9 months ago Hi Creativeone. I appreciate you as always. Thank you very much for coming by. Too many are suffering. Take care!Micky Dee9 months ago Hi Ghost. You know some of the places I've been. It's not just the "physical places". It's not "just" the imprisonment, the doing without (as in the military), it's not just the food (or lack of), it's not just being shackled, and compromised in so many ways!It's also the desperation. The hopelessness. It's the loneliness. The lack of compassion from a society that will not put the brakes on a horrible, rat infested system.The MENTAL ABUSE and SPIRITUAL ABUSE and NEGLECT are the WORST! It's all from a society that you try to promote and yes love.Thank you Ghost. I love you!(in that good way, in that God way))Rossimobis9 months ago The whole lot of list looks like fiction,one of those buster thing in the movie but they ain't no Hollywood production,now i have a work to do,i have to check Nollywood.You see Micky,you have created a project for me and i will root out this issue in my own place.Someday,i will tell you what i did.I will not just say Nigeria this time but from what i learned today,though i have always believed in the US judicial system (as the best) but it seems to come before ours,i will find out in any way.Thanks for leaving this impact in me today.I love you Micky Dee...(You are my brother).MFB III9 months ago For all the guilty ones DNA proven I say~The politeness of no mercy,echoes in the dark confinesof the coffins of his victims,bones rattle applause,falling in a clatteras he winces at the injection,sucking air and fearing death,much like they did,it's all sterile, and monitored,each need attended to,a sumptuous last meal,a man of faith to comfort,family visits to say goodbye.death politely applied,not like her lasttormented moments,begging mercyin a raw throat,her sobs ignoredas he extinguishedin a most non-civil way,all that she ever dreamed of.The politeness of no mercywill befall any who harm,a hair on the headsof my loved ones and friends.Gathering all of myMarine Corps training,I will get to thembefore the state does,and inflict mymost detailed formsof politenessin unmerciful screams.MFB III"And No jury will convict me!"Micky Dee9 months ago Hi Rossimobis. I hate to burst any bubbles but- America is the most imprisoned nations- at least among industrialized nations. A lot of people think "our" struggle is over. "Our struggle" can't be over until we all are free, especially the falsely imprisoned. Oppression is bad in Nigeria, Ireland, America or wherever it exists.

And I mean powerful in the good sense of the word.I have heard many stories like the ones above.  It is amazing how in this day and age, individuals are still being falsely accused. Not to mention, the police brutality that they also suffer.It's hard for me to even touch on this subject, because I find it so appalling.  It pulls at my heart strings and goes to my very core.Power corrupts!SageMicky Dee9 months ago Thanks you Sage. Thanks for not looking the other way. It's appalling and disheartening. There has to be an "after-life". Evil cannot be perpetuated like this and there be no punishment for the horrid actions. It is against the laws of physics. For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction! Thank you very much!Ghost Whisper 779 months ago Yes Mickydee, I do know where you have been. I know injustices that you have dealt with and that is why I love you so much and relate to you so well. God will slap down satan and change the game shortly and that is what I hold on to and know from my soul! But for down here...there is NO JUSTICE!(I am not the country club sitter-all about da money diva-live in this nasty world girl that people think. I have seen and been too many places bad for me to see all of this and think that satan doesn't exist..but on the flip side God is here and ready to give a slap down shortly!)Deborah Demander9 months ago Hey Mickeydee, there isn't much justice in the justice system. Your hub is well written, but disturbing none the less. And people wonder why we want to keep our guns!We can hope that there will be an ultimate justice.Micky Dee9 months ago We're surrounded! Well- at least we know where they are! Folks don't realize that it doesn't matter if you're doing something or not- if "they" want you for something -"they" will get you for it. Thanks Ghost- we've been there.Micky Dee9 months ago Hi Deborah Demander. You're right. Justice isn't what it's all about. It's some kind of  different extortion racket.David Koresh and the most of the Davidians would have a story of Waco than the government. The survivors sure have a different story than the government and wikipedia.Ruby Ridge. Our government isn't smart enough to plan better than they have shown us? So the government is full of idiots and mean people covering for idiots and mean people.Thanks Deborah- If they really want us- no matter where we are -we'll be "gotten". Thank you dear. It's about time I moseyed on over your way and saw what you've got over there! Thanks Deborah!Hummingbird53569 months ago This is a very good hub.  It shows the truth which many people have to live with.  The fact that because they may be poor or the wrong nationality or skin colour they do not get justice unless they are lucky.Putting someone in prison wrongfully can never be put right even if the person receives millions of dollars because you cannot buy another life.  You only have one.There is too much corruption in the world.  I don't know how we can get rid of it but if things do not improve there will be another revolution.  People can only take so much before they break.I only hope that the solution to the problem is not greater than the problem in the first place.  With the destruction of everything.Micky Dee9 months ago You are so right Hummingbird. We are people and come from the same mold.I too hope that the solution is not a greater problem. How could we know?  Thanks!parrster9 months ago Thanks Micky Dee. I can add no more to what has already been said. great hub.Micky Dee9 months ago Thank you very much Parrster. I'm mostly glad that I got this one "more" out of my head. It's been in there a long time. We could go on till the end of time with facts and figures, examples and dates. But- the LAW is "love your brother and sister". Thanks for stopping by.Dim Flaxenwick9 months ago When I started reading, I felt this is the most scary thing I've read in a long time, then it brought me to tears. Thanks for the lawyer jokes so I could laugh too. I believe in a loving God who just happens to have a timetable that I don't quite understand, but I have enough faith to know that The Almighty will serve out jusr\tice in His time.   Thanks Micky for drawing attention to something so serious. Love, Dim xMicky Dee9 months ago Thank you Dim. Shock and awe rule the day from our "rulers". What we need are more shock and awe absorbers. Thank you very much Dim. Hey- are you Xing me? You know I'll X you back!prasetio309 months ago I found something new you from this hub about Law, prisoners, crime. I hope we can living peace after read this hub. I'll read twice to know deep meaning about this hub. Good work, MickyMicky Dee9 months ago Thank you very much Prasetio. It's hard to speak out about bad government. There can be retribution from losing jobs, your freedom, etc.There is a county in North Carolina where they brag that if you were a Democrat the people would not sell land to you. people can be very "clannish" about relatives, politics, ethnicity, etc.This has been a successful country in spite of its problems.Successful in a better standard of living often but never justice. Never justice.Thanks Prasetio.theherbivorehippi9 months ago Fabulous hub!  Not fabulous for the poor people but very well written and informative.  I can't imagine how much it must hurt for the innocent to lose part of their life knowing the whole time that they are telling the truth.  So disturbing...yet then they let those go early that should be rotting away in jail for things that they actually did.  So ridiculous!Micky Dee9 months ago Very nice comment herbivorehippi. Thank you very much. Things aren't "weighed out proportionately". Thanks very much for coming by.Tammy Lochmann9 months ago How long did it take you to write this hub?  You definitely have a great big heart!  Keep up the good work.Micky Dee9 months ago It took a while. It was in my head for a very long time though. I have a lot of hubs in my head and I like to collect info on various themes but sometimes I lose focus on THE theme I should concentrate on at the moment. Thank you Tammy. I appreciate you.Coolmon20099 months ago Good article it is sad how the system took the lives from those men; I feel for them.Micky Dee9 months ago Thank you for your compassion Coolmon. I'll try to see what's new over your way tomorrow. Thanks for coming.prettydarkhorse9 months ago Hi Mick, That is why personally I dont go with death penalty as there are many who are wrongly accused, after so many years of falsely accused onme individuals sense of life is destroyed! Justive is always at some percent for the rich specially in developing countries, justice is both!Hard work again and this is just "beautiful" hub from yours again, anyway it is always like that hehe, MaitaMicky Dee9 months ago There is trouble all over. I hear there is also injustice in the Philippines. Wherever there is power there are unjust people to take it. It seems we can't lay the groundwork necessary to make the crimes over the many punished correctly. If one is in a position of power they should be punished appropriately when they abuse that power. Thanks Maita!fastfreta9 months ago What a great, but sad read.  I'm sure for every one that you've named here there are probably 50 or more for each one. What exhaustive research, I applaud you for this.  Very, very good hub.Micky Dee9 months ago Hi Fastfreta. Thank you for dropping by!I regretfully report though- if you research all the people who has been falsely accused, imprisoned, and put to death by the government and the "injustice system"-Fastfreta- your search will never end. It will never end.The World Trade Center is/was a terrible thing-The "injustice system of the US is even more terrible.It cannot even be taken into account the lives that been ruined by this system. The awful verdicts.If you want to "appeal" for the best chance of beating this "injustice system" make a lot of money. Then - you can buy a chance. It is an ATM for lawyers and judges.Our system doesn't work. It is a cash cow for attorneys.50 Caliber9 months ago Mick, hold on to your hat bicycle cowboy, it's fixing to get worse instead of better. Folks think DNA will set them free and given the chance it is a dream come true for those already convicted and evidence not conveniently lost. Eye witness accounts that convicted are slapped down time and again, giving true merit that folks just are not that aware of faces and height and the color of shirt down to the shoe, none the less they are considered top shelf. I can see them good in many cases but across a dark street at a mere fifty feet, I begin to doubt their worth and on a jury I'd hang it if that's all they had. I suppose in most cases you could never get past the "shadow of doubt" I'd hang a jury probably 75% of the time if a cops testimony made the case it'd rise to 100% of the time, I know there are good ones but few and far in between. Better 1000 guilty set free than one single innocent sent to loose the bulk of his life, or sometimes all of it to the system that hardens a heart. Imagine parole after being 20, knowing your right and the gate swinging open at 55, still knowing you were right. How hard a heart would you carry into the world, after 35 years of learning from being pent up with folks who were dirty, coming and going while your forced to stay. I'd be thinking about the record and setting it straight. If you didn't do the crime but spent the time, with all you've heard and seen as well as learned over the course of the better part of your life. Thinking about the time they held you down and took turns at your ass, if it were me I'd have an agenda to earn my degree in prison survival and how best to pay back the tuition you were wrongly billed for.Think about that for a little bit, if I were a dirty cop, judge, prosecutor, or appointed attorney who didn't even try, after all he gave what he was paid for by the system that was wanting it over as quickly as could be, these should spend their lives looking over their shoulder for guys like me, the next docket number called while in a cage men sat dressed in orange waiting their turn. For those who never saw this process I recommend go to the court house and for a few days just set in, listen and watch as the gavel falls. It will set your mind in motion to the what if's, like if he'd had a high dollar lawyer would the result be the same? Look at O.J. Simpson, an innocent man, but none the less he was barbecued for wrongful death of which he was acquitted, but tried twice for the same charge that ultimately swallowed him whole. It bogged down the airwaves of radio and TV I never believed him guilty, just a trophy of a dirty racist pig who hid behind his badge after planting evidence is what I believed. He'd be rich and famous for taking down this guy, who may not have been so spiffy clean, but I sat back and listened and when the jury went out I cast my vote of nay and the jury agreed. How is it then in this land of the free, he was charged again for the same crime and convicted, they wanted all his holdings trophy's and money, and were granted all that he owned for a crime he didn't do, said a jury and me. No telling how many felt as the jury and I, the golden rule set afire on both ends, in my mind this country will never be right, and now they have DNA to plant sealing ones fate, I trust no one a feeling I hate. At the end of the day if they want you they'll have you, that's all there is to it as we turn the page it's empty, but with pencil in hand some one will come by and fill it again with the same old shit just another day.Micky Dee9 months ago Amen Brother 50 Caliber! Amen! A thousand times- AMEN! "At the end of the day if they want you they'll have you"- you know that the the Lord Jesus God's TRUTH is it was ever spoken. People love to be apathetic. They embrace apathy and go to bed with it. They will use the phrases like, "lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas" and "well he/she must've been doing something!"The United States of America, folks, it's a mirage. It never existed as the teachers teach and the preachers preach and the politicians reach!Yes, Lord, please tell me again some of you how it's the best in the world! If this is the best we are in hell already.Here in America- we purchase everything -including an attempt to plea for fairness, for our very freedom. Buy a lawyer.Kids should be taught the Golden Rule but reality is -stay in school- make the most money you can -screw whoever is necessary - you will need it in a court on "injustice!

Our food, our water, our air, our God given RIGHT to be healthy is stolen. Our freedoms are stolen. More lives are destroyed by this stupid system of INJUSTICE! Where is the outrage? Get thy head out of the sand.OK 50- I'll back off. I'd better ride my bike for a bit. I'm wearing my keyboard out.We are living in the mostCHARMING DICTATORSHIP IN THE WORLD!Sure for all those who will say it- yeah, it's the best- that's why it's so frickin' charming.Now tell me to love it or leave it. My family has defended this country for a century and by the way- where is it that you can get away from business people who will kill anybody for a buck? Where is this land?

We need a "justice system" for everyone, not the "injustice system" that we have. Thanks you for caring for those "falsely imprisoned and murdered" by the courts! Thank you Dear!nomoretrucks8 months ago Well MD  i guess i must come clean, i was falsely imprisoned a few yrs ago for a short time for taking a vehicle which i took in a desperate situation to get somewhere. I regret it now, i guess they though i knew about the 400 tv sets which were in the back at the time!Micky Dee8 months ago And they didn't believe your story? who hasn't driven off with a loaded van occasionally? Unbelievable. It's an easy mistake!terced ojos8 months ago Wow....another great hub Micky.Injustice and corruption run rampant. It's funny. I grew up in Los Angeles and I witnessed so many criminal acts by police officers and I assumed the whole system was probably polluted in a similar manner.I'm not really surprised. I've read some stuff on the innocence project founded by Barry Scheck. The now notorious member of O.J Simpsons dream team defense.It makes me wonder historically how many black men spent their lives behind bars that we accused of raping white women; or who were accused of any crime for that matter.I imagine the phrase "any nigger will do" was quite the common phrase...I imagine it still is to some.Disturbing.Great HubMicky Dee8 months ago Thank you terced ojos! These folk drunk on power act as if there is no reckoning. But there is! Everybody has an Armageddon to attend. If OJ had one lawyer or a bad lawyer he would have swung. Claus Von Bulow the same.People should not be "required to buy a better lawyer" to achieve some kind of fairness. Thanks terced ojos!Sa`ge8 months ago wooo Mickey; I think you got a few hobs here not just one.  You steaming now for over a month.  Something got you going back there and seems you not let it loose yet, maybe a little but it still there.  I not gonna say to much cepting, GREAT work!  "and the TRUTH shall set us FREE!"

Love and Peace -- AlohaMicky Dee8 months ago Oh you Sa'ge. Thank you very much. I sprinkle a little extra sugar in occasionally so I don't scare too many off at once. Thank you Dear. Let's tell the truth and love one another! Thank you Ma'am!TINA V8 months ago There were other similar cases shown on TV shows such 48 Hours, Dr. Phil and even on news.  It is just so sad that people suffer because they were falsely accused and put in prison for something they didnt do.  There was even one case that one man was jailed in 1999 for a murder case. He appealed 3X but was denied.  He was released last year because his case was re-opened by one female lawyer.  They found out that there were evidences that were not given before to his lawyers. There were other possible suspects that were not considered.  That man is a victim of injustice. But he is a free man now.On the otherhand, there was also news about a doctor who was already accused of child molestation. It was said that he already molested more than 100 children. But his case was still pending and was not given much attention by the Medical Board. He just transferred from one state to another and he can still continue to practice his profession. This is another sad and disappointing news.I believe that Laws are formulated to guide and discipline a country. However, justice and injustices depend on the authorities whether to implement it properly, neglect it, abuse it, or even corrupt it.  I sympathize with those who experienced and suffered because of authorities negligence and abuse of power. But I hope the government will look into this matter.I will bookmark and share this to others. Great hub!Micky Dee8 months ago Hi Tina. I'm concerned that the "system" was/is flawed from its inception. We have to "pay" for an appeal for fairness. Some have more money to "appeal"! Thank you very much for coming and commenting!William F. Torpey8 months ago In my opinion, Micky Dee, there's nothing worse than being falsely accused -- and nobody worse than someone who will accuse another falsely. The system is badly flawed. Unfortunately, there's no effort to correct the wrong. Corruption should be ended ... no matter what the source. You've certainly made your point. The lawyer jokes are funny, but I'd rather see them on a separate hub because I feel they distract from the central point of this hub.Micky Dee8 months ago You're right William Sir! There's no effort. I put the lawyer jokes in because "this system" is "the part" of our government that is so flawed and has ruined so many lives that I "drone on" about it often. I see no point in delivering "our" system of government to any part of the world until we fix "this". You're probably right about the lawyer jokes but folks don't visit this much anyway as it is too serious. Thank you very much William! Happy trails Sir!blackreign20128 months ago Freakin superb Micky... Very informative and fluid. Wrongly accused people are the product of a bullshit legal system that truly does not dull out blind justice. And there is definately two sets of laws. One for the wealthy and a set for John Q public. Its utterly ridiculous that so many have been locked away some forgotten others not. Rate up on deck ~hugs~Micky Dee8 months ago Amen Sister Blackreign! The Charleston bridge is named after the "Ravenels" of SC's lowland. A few years ago one was arrested for trafficking. He of course went to rehab for a while. Then his charges were reduced. "They" go to rehab. They pass "go" and collect $200 too! Thank you Blackreign!Too many lives are ruined by a system that is horrible.It's absurd to be able to "buy" a chance for fairness in a court of law. The most money wins! The system is an ATM machine for attorneys. Thank you Dear!Petra Vlah7 months ago How right you are Micky: We are living in the most charming dictaroship in the world How right and how sad!Micky Dee7 months ago Hey Petra! I see comments about Obama on some hubs. They say he's ruining "America". These people must know they lie. America has never existed. It's on maps and in heads. If an elected leader makes any worthwhile attempt to change America for the better- that leader will not be a leader long. Americans are so content in their captivity. They can't even express a change when they vote. Thank you Petra!Darlene Sabella7 months ago Hi Ricky, when it comes to court cases, I'm in and have been following them for years.   I learned about the game and realized everything you wrote in your awesome hub was true, that was the OJ trial, I was never so shocked in my life, and that is when I realized the game.  Oh, I mean the Money game...if you are poor don't break any rules or stand next to someone who is breaking a rule.  Great hub, thumbs up and usefulMicky Dee7 months ago Hi Darlene, It really is appalling how Americans go along with this "injustice". It is without doubt a stupid system these horrible people have shoved upon us. It is insane to make someone pay for representation to appeal for some fairness when it is a racket. It is an ATM for lawyers and judges. This system, clearly, does not "work"! Thank you Darlene.mquee5 months ago Hi Mickey, this is an excellent hub that brings out the truth about justice. People having political aspirations love to show the public they are tough on crime. There is nothing wrong with being tough on crime, but how about getting the right person. It's hard to imagine that for 10, 15, or 20 years telling the world you are innocent and having no one believe you. Great research Mickey and thanks.Micky Dee5 months ago Hi mquee! Our injustice system has not worked since our country began. I cannot work. The folks who run it will not police themselves. There are no or there are very little "checks and balances" to make it work. It's run by the lazy and crooked. All involved in it must know how fallible it is. Thank you Sir.BobbiRant5 months ago Police fabricate evidence? Oh my no!  Police are such liars that it spills over into their personal lives as well, they don't have boundaries for lying.  I was asked out by a cop once my answer to him was: "Thanks, but the last thing I need is to date a guy who can manipulate the system and legally carry a gun."  :0) Great post.Micky Dee5 months ago Bobbi, you know that's right. Some seem so nice. It's just sad we can't trust anyone today.pintails78864 months ago WoW is all I can say. Great hub. as a man I dont like to admit this but it brought tears to my eyes. I have heard about much of this before, but it has been years since i put any thought into it, and being a different person now.Micky Dee4 months ago Hi pintails! The world should be real. Our law officers should be real. Judges should try to find justice and fairness. The lives ruined by our injustice system make me weep too Bud.surviveprison3 months ago It almost makes you want to stay indoors and not interact with society - out of sight out of mind - Anyhow - great hub - kudos for putting it all together.

God bless you Sir!katiem22 months ago Oh my, the sooner man realizes that he knows nothing and is useless to pass judgement the better.  A body of honest and collective integrated people should truly determine the outcome without muddy water.  Well done, you must be relieved to express this truth and reality.  Ride on dear one, Much Love and Peace :)Micky Dee2 months ago Thank you Dear Katie! Love and peace Dear!Kathy6 weeks ago I began trying to report criminal acts with the evidence that unfolded to me from 1995 to now. Nov. 2010. I spent over $  2 5 0,000's in my attempt to do nothing other than report criminal acts as they unfolded to me. I went through living hell (home burned, loaded gun planted, false police reports filed, churned out of over $25 0,000's due to corrupt attorney's covering up for other corrupt attorney's, judges, bankers and law enforcement agents. I now know that while corrupt attorney's and corrupt judges, DA's and law enforcement agents were preventing my reports and evidence (later stolen) from being reports of court record or FBI record; that fraudulently created documents were filed of court record and FBI records. I have been sit up. Why and for what reason? I learned in 2008 that my identity had been taken by associates of convicted drug money launder, Amy Ralston POfahl "before she went to prison" (Nov. 1987) and when her Drug King Pen Lord, Sandy Pofahl; attorney from Harvard and Yale was released from prison; then, a scheme knowns to law enforcement agents as a method used to launder large amounts of illegally obtained money (drug money to appear as illegal breast pills) is to target (me), an unsuspecting person (who Sandy Pofahl, Larry Morrow, Larry Sullivan brother of the Chief of POlice of Addison Texas, Amy and others knew from targetting me before they went to prison). To make said unsuspecting person (me) think that I was investing in a legal business (Ultra Sound and ad sales/health products) and then by way of corrupt insiders of State BAnk and Trust associates and corrupt attorney's involved in this scheme; the money launders stole my drivers license three times; fraudulently created several companies, bank accounts and merchant accounts (to most likely launder Sandy POfahl's estimate $350 million dollars plus) and fraudulent real estate and mortage fraud deals which SAndy POfahl and his associates have been doing since the mid 80's.; the money launders sit me up as a fall guy by simply having the clout as attorney's, judges, and inside the FBI, DA's and DEA, police, to prevent my attempts to report such things as they unfolded to me; while insiders of the FBI and courts and DA's and police were allowed to file fraudulently created documents of court record, police record and FBI records which I learned in March 2010 was done. I wrote a book due to ex FBI agent, Gil Torrez telling me to do so but, I have reason to believe that Torrez has done his fare share of preventing factual reports and evidence of mine from being of FBI record. When Bill Clinton released convicted drug money launder, Amy Ralston Pofahl; she went to live and marry the man (Derek Povah) who stole my identity before she went to prison. Amy called me from the Dublin prison to tell me that "what Doug Mulder did to Mel Jetter is what Doug Mulder was going to do to me". Doug Mulder attorney, did conceal evidence that would have proven I did not break a $  72 window. I went to jail for 10 days due corrupt Doug Mulder attorney. Mel Jettor and Randall Williams lives were destroyed due to Doug Mulder, a judge and their power to prevent evidence and prevent testimony in a court of law. All I have ever sought from 1995  to now. Nov. 2010 is "to report criminal acts with evidence and go on with my life". Since I am repeatedly prevented from reporting criminal acts; and I keep finding out about ways by which I have been sit up by attorney's, judges, organized crime, FBI, DA's, DEA, etc. for their constantly preventing my reports and evidence from being of record; and,  even false police reports were created to discredit me (according to Det. Dodson's boss, Lt. McGowen who when I asked him why Det. Dodson filed a false police report; I was told quote "so no court of law will accept your testimony".  It has taken me over 500 pages in a book to discribe 100th of what I have been put through "just trying to report criminal acts with evidence and go on with my life". When 3/4ths of my evidence was discovered stolen from my home; the police and FBI agent, Gil Torrez refused to let me report the theft of evidence. When Amy called me from the Dublin prison (one year before Bill Clinton let her out of prison) she also told me to learn about the tilted justice system and the good old boy network. She knew what was planned for me. She knew even though she was in prison while this scheme of me was in the making from 1995 to when Clinton let her out of prison in June 2000. I have now read on the Internet sits: Rodney STinch; The Jewish Drug Money Laundering Society that Owns Bill Clinton; the FBI, banks, CIA drug money laundering enterprise. There's nothing any of us can do about such criminal enteprises. The media can't expose such things because to do so could get them sued. The power of this criminal enterprise is far too high up. My life is destroyed. It has been 15  years and every year for the past 1 5 years; I learn of more evidence planted or created to sit me up and destroy my life. If anyone has any idea who will actually help me get this reported; tell me now. I have written and called and sent documents to every government agency that I can think of. Kaye Bailey Hutchison's office who told me quote "whenever you say that attorney's are involved in any criminal acts then there will be no government agency who will ever meet with you". I wrote to the U.S. Department of Justice; Marshall Jarrett who told me that this is serious allegations but the FBI has the authority to decide who they let report criminal acts and who is not allowed to report criminal acts. Wow? the laws that I read said that it's the duty of every citizen to report criminal acts and to not do so could subject anyone who knew of a crime and didn't report such to be guilty of aiding a criminal. There are alot of laws on not reporting criminal acts. So, what's the law say when the FBI, DEA, DA's, police, alot of attorney's, and other government agencies won't let me report criminal acts or when such agencies falsify documents of public and court records as they have done from 1995 to now? I've been sit up and there's no government agency anywhere who will help me.tonymac046 weeks ago Justice perverted is worse than no justice! Thanks for sharing these eye-opening stories. Gotta stand for justice, my brotherman, and you do it so well! Bless you!Love and peaceTonyMicky Dee6 weeks ago Kathy- I believe EVERY word. This injustice system is a lie. God bless you Dear.

You make the tears well up! God bless you Dear Katie!lisadpreston5 weeks ago This is a wonderful, powerful hub.  You presented the facts and cases I hadn't even heard of.  Our system is terribly flawed, there is no consistency in sentencing, and it all boils down to money.  I am having a hard time finding a rich white guy sitting on death row.  Let's face it, money talks and bullshit walks.  Prisons make big money.  Cheney knew the profit margin and was caught investing in private prisons.  I have stacks and stacks of files on corrupt judges.  I have just about given up.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sitesDear God Its MickeyDear God Its MickyMD: God, this is MD.
