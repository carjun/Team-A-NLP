Guess who else is a minority? People from overseas.He's also still hammering away at his short-China thesis. Unlike Chanos, who is presumably betting against China by shorting shares of various resource companies, Hendry is going the CDS route, buying default protection on names like Nippon Steel.He says Japanese banks are selling protection for them way too cheaply, prompting him to uncork this quintessential Hendry-ism: I see Japan as a nuclear bomb strapped onto the chest of the global economy.... Theyve got uranium -- which is, they sell credit protection: CDSs. Im the other side of that.This is probably the most interesting anti-Japan take out there, seeing as so much of the short-Japan crowd is based on the fiscal situation in Tokyo.Click here for more on Hendry's bets against China and Japan >Join the conversation about this story The Amazing Collapse Of The Working TeenPosted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 20:54:00 -0500Despite the anemic pace of job creation, December saw a sizable decrease in the headline unemployment rate thanks to a decline in the workforce.A lot of that discussion focused on folks going into early retirement or giving up the search for jobs, but there's another factor, which is the disappearance of teens in the workforce.Mike O'Rourke of BTIG has a good breakdown of what this looks like:In examining the participation data, the most notable decrease in participation has been among Teens (Chart 2). Teen participation has been in a long term decline since it peaked at 59.3% in 1978. In January 2000 it was 52.3%. In December 2007 when the recession started, it was 41.3%. Today, it is 34.3%. As noted earlier, a lower participation rate usually helps push the unemployment rate lower. During this Recession, teen unemployment hit a record of 27.1% and currently stands at 25.4%. This is remarkably high considering the way the participation rate among teens has collapsed. If the participation level of teens today was the same as it was at the start of the Recession, or 41.4%, the Unemployment Rate among teens would be approximately 45%.The next question is how do these teen participation rates fit into the overall participation and Unemployment? Despite only being 4.5% of the Labor Force at the start of the Recession, they are responsible for nearly a third of the 170 basis point drop in Total Labor Force participation. If teen participation was at December 2007 levels, the Labor Force participation rate would be 50 basis points higher at 64.8%, and the headline Unemployment Rate would be 10.1%. Teens lost approximately 1.56 Million jobs from December 2007 through December 2010, which equals 22% of the 7 million jobs the Household Survey has yet to recover since the Recession started. If teen Labor Force participation held the level of 41.4% from December 2007, there would be 2.6 million unemployed teens. Teens represent just over 3% of employed persons, a record low (the 1973 peak was 8.7%).As investors monitor the decline in the Unemployment Rate, they have to balance the decline in the Labor Force participation rate. The 50 basis points Teens represent within the 170 basis point drop is a notable influence. One must consider what influence those lost jobs and participants have on the economy. Not to minimize the travails of youth, but teens are generally in a position to fall back on their family or focus more on education. Since the overall participation rate peaked in 2000, there is potential a modest structural shift to lower participation was underway. In the end, the contraction of Labor Force participation is still a negative. Considering the origin of a large portion of the contraction, it may not be as influential on the economy as the headline number indicates.Join the conversation about this story The Week Begins, And The Euro Is Sliding AgainPosted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 20:31:18 -0500The rough start for the euro continues.With big auctions coming up in Portugal and Spain this week, the euro is diving again.Join the conversation about this story AT&T should shut up about Verizon iPhonePosted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 20:11:10 -0500I see over on Business Insider that AT&Ts PR boss is already bashing the Verizon iPhone.AT&T should shut up.I still cant use my iPhone in parts of San Francisco and at CES? AT&T was nearly unusable.AT&T has absolutely NO credibility to bash its competitors. It is, simply, a horrible company and Ill be very happy to leave it, even if top-end speeds are slightly slower.Why am I happy to leave AT&T? Because it has proven unable to support us at big events. Yes, SXSW was pretty good. But the World Series? Unusable. CES? Unusable. Web 2 expo? Unusable.They refuse to make the kinds of investments they need to make to keep our service up and running and now they are trying to bash Verizon?Hello AT&T. Every Verizon phone last week at CES worked just fine.You should shut up. Maybe after 40% of your customers leave because you mistreated us for so long your service will be faster. But it wont matter at that point because you mistreated us for so long.Sincerely, Robert Scoble, a guy who has paid you many thousands of dollars over the past three years to have your horrid service.Join the conversation about this story Here's Your NFL Playoff Schedule For Next WeekendPosted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 19:59:00 -0500Three road teams (and therefore three lower seeds) won their games on the first weekend of the NFL playoffs.

Paul Krugman followed up on our piece, and since then the debate has fallen down across predictable partisan lines, with liberals claiming that Texas shows the fallacy of low-tax, low-spending GOP nirvanas, and conservatives claiming that Texas' budget problems are way overblown.Some suspect that the budget shortfall could be as bad as $25 billion per year, while others think it will just be a few billion spread out over two years.Between that and the imminent California budget, Monday should be a huge day for muni watchers.Click here to see the 15 states with the biggest budget gaps >Join the conversation about this story YELLEN: QE2 IS WORKING (BUT I CANT PROVE IT)Posted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 18:44:58 -0500Janet Yellen gave a very good speech yesterday in Denver in which she defended the Feds policy of QE. She provides a fairly rigorous analysis of the program. The key paragraph follows:Turning now to the macroeconomic effects of the Federal Reserves  securities purchases, there are several distinct channels through which  these purchases tend to influence aggregate demand, including a reduced  cost of credit to consumers and businesses, a rise in asset prices that  boosts household wealth and spending, and a moderate change in the  foreign exchange value of the dollar that provides support to net  exports. The quantitative magnitude of these effects can be gauged using  a macroeconometric model such as FRB/USone of the models developed  and maintained by Board staff and used routinely in simulations of  alternative economic scenarios.She then concludes the speech by saying:In closing, let me reiterate that the program of asset purchases  initiated by the Federal Open Market Committee in November is intended  to support economic recovery from an exceptionally deep recession and to  restore inflation to, but not above, levels that FOMC participants  consider consistent with price stability. It will not be a panacea, but I believe it will be effective in fostering maximum employment and price stability.I have to commend Yellen for at least displaying a sound understanding of the banking system. Alan Greenspan, who was interviewed by the WSJ this weekend displayed the exact opposite understanding. Specifically, the comments by both regarding excess reserves are near opposites, but Yellen gets it dead right. Unfortunately, Yellen appears to be waving the team flag and nothing more when considering the positive effects of QE. Her comments can be easily refuted by looking at the facts.1) She says QE is positively influencing the consumers cost of credit. Thats obviously nonsense. Mortgage debt now accounts for 75% of consumer credit and the average mortgage rate has risen to 5.2% from 4.2% in September. The average mortgage payer has no perception of expected inflation rates. With more than a quarter worth of loan data now in the books since the inception of QE the facts speak for themselves. Loans are not increasing so QE2 is obviously not generating a surge in borrowing due to the reduced cost of credit:2) The wealth effect is obviously the mechanism the Fed is targeting here. The effects are highly debatable. Karl Case and Robert Shiller claim there is no impact from the equity market wealth effect. Either way, I believe this is a dangerous strategy. Nominal wealth creation via asset inflation is a very dangerous economic strategy. We should all understand this following the tech bubble and the real estate bubble. Asset markets that are intentionally diverged from their underlying fundamentals create a dangerous disequilibrium. The Fed should be targeting real underlying fundamentals as opposed to creating asset price inflation that most likely leads to irrational exuberance and eventual nominal wealth destruction. So, the positive impacts are highly controversial here, but I would argue that the final impact of the Bernanke Put will not result in a happy ending.3) Yellen claims foreign exchange impacts can impact trade, however, the change in the value of the trade weighted dollar is practically negligible since QE2 was initiated so this is obviously not driving economic growth.Overall, Yellens comments display a high level of competence when discussing the monetary system, however, her comments regarding QE are disingenuous at best. The Fed has made itself clear in the last few months  they are relying on an equity market recovery to generate a sustained economic recovery. I personally think thats a highly dangerous approach to economic growth. If past is prologue we appear to be barking up the wrong tree again when it comes to sustained US economic growth.Post Footer automatically generated by Add Post Footer Plugin for wordpress.Join the conversation about this story How Production Of The iPhone Massively Distorts The Trade Deficit With China (AAPL)Posted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 18:42:21 -0500With a market cap above $300 billion, there's no doubt that Apple is a glistening example of what's right with corporate America. If more companies were like it, the economy would be healthier.And yet, Apple is a big contributor to the US trade deficit with China.It's a point that Andy Kessler made back in 2004 with regard to the iPod. It alone accounted for a $1.5 billion trade deficit with China, and yet the iPod's existence (at the time) was seen as having added $16 billion in market cap to the company.Today the WSJ is again revisiting the same point, breaking down the math even further. While an iPhone costs about $180 wholesale, the value coming from China -- just the final assembly -- is about $6.50 per unit. And yet the entire cost of the iPhone gets counted in the trade deficit with China. As a consequence, the iPhone alone added $2 billion to the US' trade deficit with China.Again, nobody would think the trade isn't worth it, and nobody would suggest that on-net isn't good for the US economy.It's not to say that there aren't issues with currency manipulation out of Beijing, or that US manufacturing can't be more competitive. But if you think the trade deficit inherently represents some huge problem, then you need to dive further into the statistics.Click here to see 17 facts about China that will blow your mind >Join the conversation about this story AT&T Already Attacking Verizon iPhone: "Not Sure iPhone Users Are Ready For Life In The Slow Lane" (T, VZ, AAPL)Posted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 18:13:00 -0500AT&T is already attacking Verizon over the iPhone.After we wrote about Verizon's plan to offer unlimited data plans, AT&T PR boss Larry Solomon reached out with a statement: "The iPhone is built for speed, but that's not what you get with a CDMA phone.

Jan Hatzius their Chief US Economist says the says GDP growth will come in at 3.5%-4% in 2011 and that corporate profits will continue to accelerate as the economy gains momentum. This will lead to stronger jobs growth and a continuing economic recovery. In the following video Hatzius elaborated on his outlook for the labor market and the general economy:Hatzius is far from being the most bullish analyst at the firm, however. On Friday David Kostin, their Chief US Equity Strategist upgraded his outlook for the equity markets and now has a target of 1500 on the S&P (via ZeroHedge):We  are raising both our 2011 and 2012 S&P 500  earnings estimates by $2  per share to $96 and $106, reflecting annual  growth of 14% and 11%,  respectively. We boost our year-end 2011  target to 1500  representing a potential total return of 21% including  the 2% dividend  yield. Our 3- and 6-month interim targets are 1325 and  1400,  respectively. A re-accelerating US economy will drive 8% sales  growth  and explains our pro-cyclical recommendations.

Chu, EconForecast Since the start of the New Year, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil have been moving with significant bearish sentiment (See Chart) mostly on a lot of profit taking going around in the commodity space, and also on concerns over the high inventory and that supplies would exceed demand. The latest jobs report only further fanned the pessimism. However, there are two new events that could turn the market around quickly before you can say what happened? Shutdown - Canadian Upgrader First, there was a fire on Jan. 6 at an oil sands upgrader (thats where bitumen is converted to synthetic crude oil), which forced Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. to shut production at its 110,000 barrels per day (bpd) Horizon oil sands project. Canada is the top importer of crude oil and petroleum product to the United States. This 110,000 bpd capacity is almost 6% of the U.S. daily import volume from Canada.Shutdown - Alaska Pipeline Then, the Trans Alaska Pipeline, which is owned by BP, ConocoPhilips, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Koch Industries Inc., had to shut down on Saturday Jan. 8, after a leak was discovered at Prudhoe Bay. (Talk about how BP just cant get a break.) The 800-mile pipeline carries about 15% of U.S. oil production. Oil producers reportedly are in the process of cutting 95% of output, which is normally around 630,000 bpd. So far, theres no estimate as to how long the shutdown will last. Worse Than Hurrican IvanThese two outages could potentially cut the U.S. crude supply by up to 709,000 barrels per day. Thats about 8% of the U.S. crude import, and around 3.6% of U.S. consumption. To put it in perspective, this 709,000 bpd volume is morethan the disruption caused by Hurricane Ivan. When Ivan hit the U.S. Gulf in 2004, it took down about one third of the oil output in the region, which is around 1.6 million bpd. OPEC Eyeing$110 a BarrelLast but not least, several OPEC members are increasinly talking about howthe Cartel would not act unless crude crosses $110 a barrel. This new tightened supply picture, couple withOPEC talks will most likely turn crude oil to move on its own momentum. As such, there will be new money coming into the market, more upward pressure, and lots short covering. Breaking Above$93 onSupply ConcernsFrom a technical standpoint, theres a high probability that crude could easily top $91 a barrel as early asMonday, Jan 10, before busting through $93 a barrel levels by end of the week on supply concerns. And also look for WTI to outperform Brent during the week. Dian L. Chu, Jan. 9, 2011 | Mobile Reader, Website | Facebook Page | New Article Alert | Google Profile Sponsored: How To Spot Winning Futures TradesShare Join the conversation about this story What Barack Obama could learn from IkePosted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 16:17:14 -0500I am old enough to remember President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the man we all called "Ike". He came to public attention in December of 1943 when President Roosevelt named him Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. He led the Allies at D-Day and in their successful recovery of Europe during World War Two. A very popular General, he was also a very popular President defeating Adlai Stevenson, the Governor of Illinois at the time and a popular man in his own right, in a 1952 landslide victory. Four years later in 1956, he repeated his landslide victory, once again over Stevenson, but by an even larger margin.Among his many accomplishments, perhaps the greatest in terms of its socio-economic impact, was the creation of America's Interstate Highway System. He spent his later years as a well-respected man who put politics aside. Although he was always available by phone to his successor, John F. Kennedy, whenever his advice was requested, as it was from time to time, he kept that fact to himself.As President, Ike was frequently criticized by his political opponents for "playing too much golf" and not being the intellectual that Adlai Stevenson was. In a much milder way, he received criticism similar to that directed toward George W. Bush, but his stature and accomplishments were so much greater than Bush's that this had little effect. However, it would have been fair to say that he was not seen as the kind of President who willingly create controversy or criticize those who supported him when he felt they were wrong.So it was that Ike's "farewell address" to the American people as he was about to hand over the Oval office to JFK was not expected to be at all provocative, quite the contrary. Perhaps a nice "thank you" as he stepped down, but nothing to remember. Oh, how wrong they were. On January 17 of this year, it will be the 50th anniversary of that farewell address. Half a century ago, what could a retiring 70-year-old man, never known for profound statements, say that could have any meaning today? Let's take a look at a couple examples.This man who had served in the American military all his life and at its highest ranks, this man who had received the support of American industry in both his campaigns, had this to say:Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence--economic, political, even spiritual---is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.This man who knew well the great advantages provided him as a military and political leader by the science and technology communities has this to say:Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present--and is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.Wow. Those were thoughtful statements, but they were also very powerful statements and came completely as a surprise. They were powerful then and they still hold great power today.If I were speaking with President Obama, I would tell him that he is a very well-educated and intelligent man and I have no doubt that his "farewell address", whether that comes in two years or six, will be carefully listened to with far greater expectations than President Eisenhower's fifty years ago. I would tell him what he already knows in as polite a manner as possible: his first two years have failed him, his nation, and the world. I would tell him that this is indeed a period of great crisis demanding great leadership. He needs to speak as plainly and honestly as Ike once spoke, but he cannot wait until his departure from the White House. We cannot wait for that and he must not wait for that for everyone's sake. I would not suggest a "farewell address" as that is clearly not appropriate, but a similar address to the American people at the completion of half a term that has been as disappointing as this one is more than in order, it is critical.We do not need a President who is seen as distant and aloof. We do not need any more photos taken on basketball courts or walking in the surf. We need a President of the United States of America to sit before us, look us in the eye, and tell us what he has learned, where he wants to lead us, how he plans to get there, and why it is important that we support him. Barack Obama is not the first American President to be sharply criticized and he will not be the last. But one thing has seemed clear to me throughout my lifetime. Americans do respect and honor the Presidency, if not always the man (and some day, woman) who holds the office temporarily. We want to be led and we respect those who lead, whether their name is Roosevelt or Reagan, but we also require respect in return. Speaking to us plainly and honestly in a time of crisis, focusing clearly on our fears and needs, is critical to that respect. I would finish my conversation with President Obama by suggesting he read President Eisenhower's address and consider how he might provide something as insightful and useful to us today, not two years from today, not six years from today, but today.Join the conversation about this story Verizon Will Give iPhone Users Unlimited Data Plans (T, VZ, AAPL)Posted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 16:16:00 -0500Verizon plans on offering iPhone users unlimited data plans when it starts selling the phone in a few weeks, the Wall Street Journal reports.AT&T only offers capped data plans for its users, though its monthly prices are lower than Verizon.At Verizon, iPhone owners will be able to pay $30 per month for unlimited data. AT&T's most generous plan is $25 per month for 2 gig of data.While 2 gigs is plenty, Verizon could use the "unlimited" data as a marketing pitch to steal customers.Though, obviously, the number one selling point will be that iPhone owners can finally make phones calls without worrying about dropped calls.(Assuming it's been AT&T's fault all along, and not something wrong with the iPhone.)See Also: Here's Why Steve Jobs Would Let Verizon Announce The Verizon iPhoneJoin the conversation about this story See Also:IT'S ON: Apple Will Sell At Least 10 Million Verizon iPhones This YearVerizon iPhone This Month?

Here's Steve Jobs on Apples most recent earnings call:[Apple] strongly believe[s] that one or more very strategic  opportunities may come along that were in a unique position to take  advantage of because of our strong cash position. And I think weve  demonstrated a really strong track record of being very disciplined with  the use of our cash. We dont let it burn a hole in our pocket, we  dont allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions.And  so I think that wed like to continue to keep our powder dry because we  do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the  future. Thats the biggest reason. And there are other reasons as well  that we could go into. But thats the biggest one.While Steve sure sounded like Apple is looking at a huge M&A deal,I dont expect Apple to acquire any large companies (which I label as anything with a $3 billion and higher price tag).Company CultureIt is an  understatement to say that Apples corporate culture isunique. Apple  managers have roles that are not typical in other companies, with more  time spent on actual product development and brainstorming. Apple  managers rarely just manage.Former IBMexecutiveMark  Papermasterreportedlyleft Apple only a few months on the job as SVP  Devices HardwareEngineeringdue to culturalincompatibility. On top of  that, Apple had spent months trying to fill the SVP Hardware position  before settling on Papermaster.It is tough for Apple to fill its top  ranks due to itsuniqueculture. If Apple were to acquire a company with  a large workforce, it would be tricky to assimilate these new Apple  workers to the culture that has led to so much success.Conflicting  company culture is one of the biggest reasons for failed M&A and  that rings even truer in Silicon Valley.CompanyStructureAs I discussed in a previous post,  Apples structure allows decision makers to come in contact with  everything that is shipped to the consumer (Macs, iPhones, iPads, etc)  and more importantly everyone who is in charge of the product  (designers, engineers, marketers, etc.). Ideas are not bounced off of  committees. Finished products are not required to get a certain number  of approvals. I know of few, if any, large companies with a similar  structure.For Apple to acquire and assimilate a company with a  management structure reminiscent of a Egyptian pyramid, more than luck  and hard work would be needed.No Prior History for Large M&A1Apple has never acquired a large company. Apples largest acquisition  was NeXT in 1997 for $404 million ($540 million inflation  adjusted).RecentacquisitionsP.A. Semi and Quattro Wireless were $278  million and $275 million,respectively.What is the right kind of M&A for Apple?Peter Oppenheimer, Apple CFO, on Apples F1Q10 earnings conference call was pretty clear:[Apple] occasionally acquire[s] small companies from time to time for their technology and talent. That is why we do it.Tim Cook, Apple COO, shed more light on Apples M&A strategy at an investor conference in 2010.[Apple has] always been about making the best product,  not having the highest market share or the highest revenue, and so  acquiring a company so our revenue gets larger isnt something that  drives us.I think Tim Cooks quote isimportant. Apple is focused on making  the best products, not growing its earnings. Steve Jobs knows great  products drives great earnings and Apple will never follow any other  rule, or its continued success will be in jeopardy.As an example, would Apple acquire Twitter? Would Twitter help make Apples current product lineup better? I dont think so. (I am not even considering Twitters financials and possible sale price)So what will Apple do with its cash?1. Acquire talent to plug any holes in Apples current team and  resources. I suspect some software teamacquisitionsmay be in the  offering as distinguishing software will become even more important for  Apple to set itself apart from the competition. Buying smaller teams of  outside talent makes companyassimilation, from both a culture and  company structure viewpoint, easier to accomplish. A small group of  acquired software engineers can be quickly lumped within the iTunes or  iOS team without muchdisruption.2. Long-term agreements (aka strategicopportunities) for product  components. In 2009, Apple paid an up-front cost of $500 million to  enter into a long-term agreement with Toshiba for NAND flash chips.  Recent rumors include Apple partnering with Sharp and Toshiba to build  LCD factories with a price tag over $1 billion. Apple faces supply  constraints whenever a new product is released and I expect Apple to  pour billions into itsinfrastructure, forming new partnerships to  guarantee that components are available, and at a good price, when  needed. Finally, Apple needs additional investments, such as the $1  billion data center in North Carolina, to support and grow its current  product lineup.3. I dont expect Apple to buyback its stock or issue stock dividends in the near term.All of these investments and cash outlays wont end up costing  anywhere near $50 billion, but since when was having a lot of cash that  bad of a thing?1 Some will say it is for this reason that Apple is interested  in a more experienced CFO. I would respond that Apples storied history  is a result of no large M&A. For Apple to change course now,  especially considering how its team is performing, would be shocking to  me and serve as a worrying indicator that something is awry in  Cupertino. I am not ruling out large partnerships or agreements with  certain companies that are not in a position to be acquired (Facebook,  AT&T, Comcast etc.), but these are a whole other ball game compared  to an acquisition.Join the conversation about this story See Also:Apple Is Looking For A New CFO -- Approached Blackstone CFO For The JobHow Apple Keeps Its Laser-Sharp FocusHere's Why Steve Jobs Would Let Verizon Announce The Verizon iPhoneWeekender: Did China Just Ring a Bell?Posted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 15:55:30 -0500As the old saying goes, they dont ring a bell when a market tops.But sometimes it sure feels like it.Two quick examples: The first from my days as a wet-behind-the-ears commodity broker in 1998.I had come into the biz near the tail end of one of the most vicious commodity bear markets of all time. The president of the firm, a diehard grain bull, was convinced everything was about to turn around. Many of our big clients were farmers and he couldnt bring himself to go bearish, repeating the mantra to never short anything below the cost of production.A big crop report was coming out, and the whole office was bullish on soybeans. Beans in the teens! was the rallying cry, though soybeans were only pushing $6.00 per bushel at the time.The crop report came out, and the news was incredibly bullish  just as we had anticipated. Soybean prices were set to explode! Except they didnt. The futures climbed a couple cents on the open, then ran out of gas and slumped lower on the day.The boss was frustrated beyond belief. I give up!, he shouted, throwing up his hands and walking out of the room.Wheels were turning in my rookie brain. If beans are that weak in the face of a big bullish report, I thought, maybe we should be shorting them in size. Unfortunately, as the new kid, I didnt have the moxie to act on that idea  or the guts to go against the rest of the firm. And it was too bad over the next eight months or so soybean prices plummeted, hitting a mind-boggling low of $4.02 per bushel in July 1999. I have little doubt that at least a handful of traders, more seasoned and more objective, made an absolute fortune on that moveThe second bell ringing example comes from June 2007, when the Blackstone Group went public.Those were the days of private equity euphoria. In March 07 The Economist had declared PE guys the kings of capitalism. In an over the top cover splash, Fortune magazine declared Schwarzman himself the new king of Wall Street.Private equity had ridden a wave of cheap money mania to the ultimate leveraged glory, and Schwarzman was cashing out  via the IPO  at the perfect time. Fortress Investment Group (FIG) had gone first, making its founders billionaires on paper. Blackstone represented the crescendo  confirming Schwarzman a sort of diabolical genius.Given that private equitys game is to fix up assets and then hand them off at peak valuation (or as close to that as possible), you had to give Schwarzman a golf clap. The hype, the mania, the buildup, the final coup of selling at the most breathless moment  it was perfect.BX (the Blackstone ticker) debuted on the NYSE in the rough vicinity of $35 per share.It pretty much went straight to five bucks after that.So why bring up these stories? Because that old bell ringing feeling is in the air againYou know those tired jokes about how Hummer and Ferrari drivers are compensating for something? One could say the same (on a national scale) when it comes to tall buildings. The desire to show off the worlds tallest building is a sort of reliable tell for excesses of hubris and economic leverage.The von Mises institute has an article describing this phenomenon, Skyscrapers and Business Cycles. Bottom line being, the skyscraper indicator has a good record in predicting important downturns in the economy.As the above graphic shows, for some time the worlds tallest building has been the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, opened in January 2010.So getting back to the bell ringing, I give you China plans $1.3 bn seven star hotel:Beijing authorities plan to build a seven-star hotel modelled after Dubais Burj Khalifa  the worlds tallest building  in a $1.3 billion joint project with Saudi Arabia.The hotel will be erected in western Beijings Mentougou district some 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the Chinese capitals centre, the state-run Beijing Morning Post said in a Thursday report, quoting a local parliamentary meetingClassic isnt it?Noted bear Jim Chanos has said that China is Dubai times a thousand.Chinas planners seem to have taken that statement as a compliment  or even a pledge to live up to  as opposed to a dire warning.The air is rich and thick with irony and hubris-fueled stupidity. Considering that China is in the grips of a white hot real estate mania, youd think the last thing they want to do is invite comparisons to a major league fiasco that wound up like this (Time Magazine, Oct 2010):Theres a half-off sale in the worlds tallest building.Even with an address at the iconic Burj Khalifa, rents for residences  in the tower are not immune from Dubais real estate crash. Indeed,  nearly a year after it was inaugurated with a massive  water-and-fireworks display, about 825 of the towers 900 ultra-luxury  apartments remain unoccupied, according to Better Homes, a real estate  brokerage in DubaiGeniuses or Idiots? And by the way, this topic brings up a little bone I have to pick with the China bulls.As of this writing, bullish views on China are extensive and widespread. Underscoring much of this bullishness is the implied belief that Chinese planners are smart while the American government is stupid.Beijing, and China at large, is supposedly being run by savvy geniuses who will successfully manage away all problems (like rampant inflation) and not put a serious foot wrong.After all, while American politicians play checkers, China is populated by serious long-term thinkers playing the subtly complex strategic game of Go.Uh-huh. Yeah.I ask you, how incredibly out of synch with history is this conveniently bullish viewpoint? Over the centuries, the millennia even, the track record is clear: Governments are cack-handed and dumb. If they do not start out dumb, they wind up dumb. Hubris, overreach, and the great weight of managing complexity overtakes them.The old saying, shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations, could well apply to economic booms in modified form. Even the founding fathers of the United States made plenty of gargantuan economic mistakes.Whats more, the China wont falter narrative is all the more impossible given that the historical track record of major power success is one of experiencing crisis, dealing with crisis, and eventually overcoming crisis  not sidestepping it completely through slick management!And yet now we are supposed to believe the Chinese government is different? That these guys  a bunch of dusted-off communists no less  have cracked the code?Not bloody likely, as a subject of the defunct British empire might say.Just for fun, lets go with the hypothesis that maybe Chinas leaders are not geniuses but idiots run-of-the-mill knucklehead types as with other heads of state. What evidence might we have for this assertion? How about the following:China      has bet its future on an aggressively mercantilist and, in the eyes of      some, massively protectionist growth strategy that could wind up blowing      up in its face (via Western backlash) at precisely the wrong time.China      has bet the farm on its ability to avoid devastating breakouts of strife      and civil unrest, born as direct result of a mercantilist strategy that      holds back purchasing power, holds down wages, and pumps up internal inflation      pressures (in a country where food and energy costs still represent the      lions share of domestic income).In its effort to hoover up large volumes of business, China has forced major portions of its export sector to live or die on razor-thin profit margins, leaving these businesses exceptionally vulnerable to new threats of economic downturn, modest currency revaluation, or state-subsidized financing withdrawal.China      has presented itself as the savvy accumulator of huge amounts of U.S.      debt, potentially without realizing it is the fish at the poker table.      (If I sell you a mountain of worthless paper and convince you it is worth      something, who exactly is the sucker here?)In      embracing runaway stimulus and out-of-control money pumping, China has      embraced the failed policies of Alan Greenspan, even after observing      what the Greenspan mentality hath wrought.In      dragging its feet on reining in a real estate mania, China is willingly      setting itself up for a Dubai times a thousand scenario, even after      observing what such in the United States, Dubai and elsewhere hath      wrought.Nor have we mentioned the many and varied unsustainable environmental, social and logistical trends born of an overly rigid, centrally dominated economy that may well be built on an infrastructure ponzi schemeWell see how things play out of course. And one would be wise to heed the great Stan Druckenmillers advice, re, never use valuation to time a market. (Thats what price action is for.)But I humbly submit before the market court of opinion that Chinas leaders are most likely dumb, not smart  not necessarily excessively so, but in the same manner and fashion that all other governments have proven themselves dumb over time.And with their new lets be like Dubai intentions, they are working hard to confirm itJoin the conversation about this story AZ TragedyPosted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 14:58:06 -0500Down in a hole all weekend writing, I just found about about this shooting in Arizona.

It appears that a section of pipe that is buried in concrete is leaking. This is going to mean the excavation of the site to decide if there has possibility been a long term leak. This also is going to take the resetting of the pipeline with new concrete poured. It is early January, with winter temperatures impacting this kind of work, at this time of the year.This will also impact the restarting of the pipeline due to the crude cooling in place over the next few days to weeks.BP spokesman Steve Rinehart called the incident a significant event.  He said BP periodically has been forced to cut output due to large-scale  power outages or when heavy winds have interrupted tanker loadings at  the port of ValdezThe leak appeared to be from a section of piping at the station that  is encased in concrete. Alyeska shut down the Trans Alaska Pipeline at  8:50 a.m. and crews were on site to assess the situation and isolate the  source of the leak.Ms. Egan said additional resources were en route to support containment, recovery and repair efforts.Until we excavate everything around the concrete encasement we cant  say definitively that it hasnt leaked out into the soil, she said.  She said the shutdown of the pipeline gives us time to assess the  situation and do it without harm to the environment.After the pipeline was shut down, Alyeska ordered all North Slope producers to scale back production to 5% of normal levels.The excavating of steel, concrete and freezing crude oil from the frozen tundra in the middle of the January winter is going to take longer than first estimated. The US has realistically lost 9% of its supply indefinitely.Filed under: Commodities, Communications, International Tagged: Alaska Pipeline, Alyeska, Beyond Petroleum, BP, North Slope, Oil Leak, Pump Station 1, Shutdown        Join the conversation about this story MySpace Gave A Bogus Reason For Taking Down Gunman's PagePosted: Sun, 09 Jan 2011 14:38:00 -0500Alleged Arizona gunman Jared Lee Loughner left a disturbing trail on the Internet, including a MySpace page that the company removed after he was identified.MySpace lawyer marketing VP Sean Percival tweeted yesterday that it is company policy to place the page in a state of "purgatory" so it could be preserved for law enforcement. Apparently, the concern is that the page could be hacked or otherwise defaced, so it might not be usable as evidence.This doesn't make any sense. A MySpace page isn't a physical object like a gun or a book. It's a bunch of bits stored on a computer somewhere, and it can be duplicated endlessly with no loss of resolution.To preserve this page as evidence, MySpace could make a backup of the page, time stamp it, and put it on a hard drive or computer with no Internet connection. Heck, MySpace could do this every five minutes for the next week.Instead, MySpace took the page off the Internet entirely.MySpace owner News Corp has the right to remove or change pages on the site for any reason at all. Maybe MySpace wants to make sure that people don't post comments offensive to the victims. Or maybe they don't want to give this guy's friends or sympathizers any public venue at all. That's totally understandable. But using law enforcement as an excuse is bogus.Join the conversation about this story See Also:Is This Just A Fact Of Life In America?
