Except in the US, where more and more people are far from sorry at having to wave goodbye to wedlock. When divorce happens, they choose to party rather than to cry.In an age when half of all marriages in the US end in divorce, there is a whole new trend: celebrating the break-up.Where there is demand there is supply. On the market there are party planners, divorce gifts, all sorts of related merchandise, from clothes to kitchenware, and even divorce cakes. When you look at all this abundance you start to doubt whether a break-up is actually a bad thing. Back in the day, divorce was looked upon as a negative thing and nowadays divorce, because there are so many of them for many different reasons, has more of a positive twist, said Beth Price of Divorce Shower store.Although in reality divorce is hardly a positive trend, some Americans are making the most of it. Celebration agencies are now adding divorce ceremonies to their menu, almost like a wedding. There are even special divorce rings for those who need more symbolism. According to divorcee Joann Lane, such symbolism really helps people experiencing divorce come to terms with transition.Symbolism does help get over some transitions to make changes. However for some, symbols are not enough and more practical help is needed to get over a separation. You might ask what a good workout, or a delicious cupcake, or a make-up artist, have to do with divorce. There is one person who combined it all and more in her relief program for the heartbroken. http://rt.com/news/features/divorce-party-us-business/Six months ago, Lyss Stern started hosting regular Life After Divorce events to empower women after their separations. She offers the help of a host of experts: a matchmaker, a nutritionist, a yoga instructor, a psychic, a make-up artist, and a life coach to name just a few.According to Lyss, her events help women feel better. They are getting cupcakes, they are getting champagne, their make-up done, they are getting a matchmaker, they can talk to a psychic- they are really getting so much for the $40 dollars they pay to come to this event, she said. Many behind the burgeoning divorce business in the US say being positive sells. It surely does, as more and more newly-single Americans strive to reinvent themselves and bury their past.groups:News, Psychology, Law and Justice, Current Cultural Issues tags:Culture,US,Divorce |51 comments// "Divorce Shower" - Burgeoning divorce business in the US // Videohide all repliesdisplay:newest | oldest | popularupload filewebcamembed codeimage urlPaste the url of an image:processPaste an embed code:processUpload a video or image file:1GB file size limit: Supported Formats Online Display Ad:300x250 pixelsFlash Video Overlay Ad:300x50 pixelsUpload an image to represent your video:We will automatically pick out an image to represent video files.If you want to choose your own image, upload it here.Return to the Standard UploaderUpload an image to represent your video:A thumbnail image is required.Record a webcam:[x]we might already have a story about this: Choose media for your post:checking post...+ addblog/text/link/video/image/webcamadvanced upload+ addembed code/image urlchecking post...|cancelI want to upload this to Current.com, and I own the rights to this file.Help us classify your file.

Men, women and children loose and lawyers always win with pocket full of money. 5 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  MotherForTruth:Funny how there weren't even law schools when this country was founded yet there were lawyers. All one had to do was pass the Bar. It just shows you how perverted the "law" has become that it takes 8-12 years of post secondary education in order to even understand the law. That is no way to run a society. 5 days agoflag  reply0MotherForTruth  hammywill:I agree. 4 days agoflag  reply0AndrewEssQuite often we find those business operations that soak up all that alimony money or other former marital assets rather quickly are first to promote themselves.  It's all about feeling good and moving on don't you know, who cares about the wake of misery, we shall confirm it by making delicacies of symbolic emancipation, involving heinous acts committed against our vile former oppressors.  A divorce ordeal through family orchestrated courts is one heck of a ride by either litigating party. However we must take note that this is a consumer economy and 84% of paying consumer choices are dictated by females.  Let's not complain, 'just buy shares in the company'.  To make a point lets look at the figures for Homeland security for a year to date update;Terrorist Plots Discovered           0Unauthorized Traveler                 715Toothbrushes confiscated           90,008Liquids/containers(Unknown)      154,703                 Marital devices                           17,413Transvestites                              133Hernias                                       1485Hemorrhoids                               3172 Enlarged Prostates                     8249Breast Implants                           59350Natural Blonds                     3............Now that should tell us something ! 5 days agoflag  reply+2MotherForTruthI found this report interesting and disturbing at the same time. First of all, American consumerism and profits are as usual in forefront. Secondly, in my opinion, this new business is geared towards women, as women are great consumers of such services. Thirdly, I find that our "not your fault" society does not allow opportunity for personal growth thus creates more of the same failure in future relationships. 5 days agoflag  reply0Incredulous  MotherForTruth:totally agree, another really interesting post! 5 days agoflag  reply0MotherForTruth  Incredulous:Thank you :) 4 days agoflag  reply+2AndrewEss  MotherForTruth:The easiest way to overcome a nation is to breakdown or dispossess families.  It is also called denaturizing or taking hostage.  The biblical analogy for the method is called 'Baal'ism".   A detachment from nature, then detachment from all things natural.  In all regimes howsoever they are formed the first object is to separate the men from the women and children.  It is a menu item on all tactical moves as in war it is in social politics with purpose.  Here in the US following a rather unique model we create the sopophist. (not misspelled)  Like the education system, it teaches that what you think will have no opposition, (can't hurt your feelings can we !) in turn teaching critical thinking is a negative.  There is a book called 'Behold a pale horse' by ' William Cooper that provides a cursory introduction to the problem.  Also a very recent in depth one called 'Education out of bounds', regarding the ungodly tools used by artisans of communism and new world federalist thinking.  It is also generically the methods used to reinforce the umbrella Alinsky or delphi political method on the consumer.  We create the market, the demand, then the product, in the case of the state or federal government we create the problem and provide the solutions or the desired outcome.  Such wonderful saviors they are aren't they.  It is in effect and sadly the very strength of this newer form of individualism that is expressed quite openly by many females and males who are led by this strange new breed of edumedia type feed. Really they wouldn't know a hard days work if it got up and bit them, nor will they tolerate or know real pain and strife.  A rather great goal and achievement, I would wish for all of us but it is reserved for the 'intelligent idiots', (see Karl Marx or more appropriately "Antonia Gramsci for an explanation). The poor, the meek and the mild will as always pay the price first.  It also has created a likewise thinking growing army of progeny.  Never knowing or wanting to face fear or death, where their food comes from, nor even capable of fixing things without supervision or instructions, to do things by strict demarcation by state approved licensed operators.  Heck now I can't even find out whether anyone I have contact with professionally or personally has mental issues unless I work for the state or a female.   The sad thing of course for the males out here is our inability to get to the fountain or creation of these problems to overcome our natural or now growing and confusing political impotency by instinct to protect and defend.  Instead we are brow beaten, accused of heinous acts and worse vilified by all.  Even old movies and documentaries are slowly being redubbed using only female voices.  The sad thing of course for me is I love more than anything in the world a self sufficient, and able female.  But I fear the stop the female breeding program currently in play, turning females from both nurturing children (reinforcing blood familial dynasties) and males will ultimately serve them very badly.  I do not see females taking on the more physical or monotonous harder tasks usually earmarked for males in great numbers, or even allowed as in frontline combat to take on many tasks through cultural taboos.  After all if the sugar daddy state can give them and guarantee better toys than boys by turning their former partners into pay slaves for stupendous celebrations as in this case. The need for interaction with those evil males can be suppressed and turn out to be more interesting as they turn themselves over to the consumer meat market and other forms of social and personal experimentation.   I believe for many males the message for those who resist the natural urge is clear and were it not for familial ties or responsibility, they would be long gone.  Historically this is a fact as we see here and in Eastern European countries where this was well practiced, the countries became unproductive and sterile.  China followed it's post war global orders by outright imposing policies, here they are simply doing the round robin on females.   The system has learned to place children at the front, the females behind and then themselves behind the wizard of oz curtains.  A veritable obstacle for males to get past, yet here we are applauding and celebrating the very thing that is destroying America.  How ironic.  Or is it simply a celebration that the judiciary has stopped the financial blood letting and mind f....g the family.   Particularly the females by coercion and psuedo threats that the asshole she married didn't get the babies and didn't get half the loot from the liquidated family assets.  The ol miami shuffle trick, where the truth is when the big numbers are liquidated all those 0's look good but they often never look at the 0's the attorneys took for taking care and saving that poor damsel in distress.  We shall follow the rules by omission of facts, so that what is alleged and not disputed becomes evidence.   Whatever it is the nation has just had another few thousand divorces today.  Champagne time for some, I guess.   I shall now go away and contemplate my oneness with the great Borg. 4 days agoflag  reply+2Incredulousinteresting that the report came from DC....the happiest couples you see there are all on DuPont circle.Maybe instead of blaming the failure of marriage by gender, or paying someone else to do what we can do for ourselves (I mean seriously, palm reading, cupcakes and champagne?) maybe we should re-examine our definitions and expectations for marriage.  I think a lot of people get married without a clue about what they are doing, or what they are agreeing to do.  The 1950s formula for marriage doesn't work any better than the 1950s formula for poverty measures what it means to be poor in 2011.  A lot has changed about how people live and work, and marriage is one of those behemoth institutions, shrouded not only in fantasy and mirage, but seriously out of touch with what it aspires to be.I don't think it's all the man's faulty (contrary to prior sarcasm) anymore than it's all the woman's fault.  I think if we want to find fault, we should probably look more closely at how we define our expectations for what it means to be married. 5 days agoflag  reply0Christopher_CoxThis is whats wrong with people these days , this also is very male hating everything you see in the videos shows how people think. just blame the guy has to be his fault, ya right I was abused and cheated on my whole life. one day the world will change . 5 days agoflag  reply+1hammywill  Christopher_Cox:Male hating? I didn't see anything that was male hating. Not sure where you got that. 5 days agoflag  reply+1shatteredmen  hammywill:I guess you missed the  cake where she had his head in her hands.  Although I would have to point out there was a cake where the woman was on the side of the cake with what was suppose to be her blood around.   Also what about those shot glases?  I think being called a B... ( a female dog) is a lot less offensive that being called a P.... )offesensive word for penis)I see lot of misandry in this.  The women were doing more celebrating than the men were but why not, they file for 80% of the divorces and often because they have found a new honey that makes more money.  Plus the Violence Against Women Act assures they will walk way with everything, inlcuding the house, (did you see the one where he had the card that said he was homeless)  and everything esle. 5 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  shatteredmen:"often because they have found a new honey that makes more money" This statement alone shows the misogynistic way in which you think. I saw as many of the products themselves were for men. The VIOLENCE Against Act has nothing to do with divorce. Sorry, I am not buying how this is Anti-Male. 5 days agoflag  reply+1Christopher_Cox  hammywill:The DV act crap really hurts men { even men like ME } who were abused by the woman though the whole relationship then after when the woman uses the law to hurt more . in the end i think things will turn out on my side BUT the past year has been hell for me and the children. not many can say they did not do anything AT ALL but i can , i was abused - cheated on - then hung out to dry by the system all based on lies . very long story but iam sure iam not alone in it . 5 days agoflag  reply+1hammywill  Christopher_Cox:I'm sorry about your situation, I pray and hope that it all turns out well for you. 5 days agoflag  reply0Incredulous  shatteredmen:Wait a minute, how exactly does the violence against women act ensure she walks away with everything....you lost me there.  I'd say hiring a bad lawyer might ensure that, but honestly, are you saying that if the law would just let the jilted husband beat the shit out of her, then he could keep everything, even his house?  There are countries you can move to and have it that way you know...Logic=FAIL 5 days agoflag  reply+1Incredulous  Christopher_Cox:You are not alone.  I know lots of men who have had that done to them, and a few who are still having it done to them. I also know lots of men who have done horrible things to their wives.  It's not a balanced equation, and the system very often does suck.  People get married too young, too infatuated, too attracted to the wrong things in each other, and then their marriage falls apart and everyone suffers, man, woman, children...even the pets suffer. Trying to decide who should take the most blame can eat up your entire life. 5 days agoflag  reply+3MotherForTruth  Incredulous:I believe the reference to VAWA referenced here for the reasons that under VAWA a woman can (and many women do) falsely claim she is in fear of her husband as a calculated divorce strategy. In fact many divorce attorneys suggest such strategy. VAWA was created to protect real victims of domestic violence but this law has been abused more then helped. A simple "I am afraid" statement will insure the victory in child custody, marital property, financial benefits. 5 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  MotherForTruth:The question is do you think the VAWA is a bad law? 5 days agoflag  reply+1MotherForTruth  hammywill:The real question is why does the law only protects some victims of domestic violence? "Over 250 scholarly studies demonstrate that women are as physically aggressive, or more aggressive, than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners." http://saveservices.org/pdf/Seven-Facts-Every-American-Should-Know-About-DV.pdf 5 days agoflag  reply0Christopher_Cox  MotherForTruth:In the end { I am afraid was all it took } for my Ex to get a FRO on me , with that many jobs lost and my guns taken away and now i am a criminal . the tide I hope is turning as her lies are catching up with her . and i have the one thing she never will , our childrens love trust and respect . the only child stuck with her right now is the youngest only due to shes in the hands of the courts . it should be a balanced system , and ANYONE who hits another male or female should be delt with by law . in the end its only the children that suffer. 5 days agoflag  reply+2MotherForTruth  Christopher_Cox:No doubt children suffer, but so are the victims of lies. 5 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  MotherForTruth:The law does not ONLY protect some victims of DV. The VAWA was created to address a systemic ignoring of domestic violence against women. The same as the Civil Rights Act. 5 days agoflag  reply0Christopher_Cox  MotherForTruth:I know that all to well BUT i would suffer for my children and not complain IF they were happy . 5 days agoflag  reply+1Incredulous  MotherForTruth:that is fu_ked up, I know, and it is like so many other places the government sticks its nose in and tries to treat every case like it will fit into one or two laws that aren't made for the people, or even by the people. 5 days agoflag  reply0Incredulous  Christopher_Cox:Oh, I think both you and your ex-wife are suffering too.  Divorce sucks, no matter how much we try to pretend it doesn't, it does, for everyone involved. 5 days agoflag  reply+1MotherForTruth  hammywill:The intentions where good, but the reality is quite different. Women are just as aggressive if not more aggressive then men when it comes to domestic violence. Please take a look at the link and you will see the real picture of Domestic Violence and the facts. Men do suffer domestic violence and physical abuse but law does not protect them. Why? 5 days agoflag  reply0MotherForTruth  Christopher_Cox:I am sure your children know that. 5 days agoflag  reply0MotherForTruth  Incredulous:You are absolutely right. 5 days agoflag  reply+1hammywill  MotherForTruth:True most studies that address the male/female domestic violence ratio show that the rates are roughly equivalent. I think the VAWA was created to address certain historic inequities in the treatment of women under the law, the current alleged discrepancies notwithstanding. I think an interesting study would be to see how the rates of Domestic Violence against men have changed since instituting such laws. There is no denying the historic mistreatment of women as citizens in the United States, but I am not sure that justifies any sort of punitive social treatment of men. I think, sadly, we are not likely to see a balancing of the pendulum, instead it will swing wildly from one side of the spectrum to the other. Because human beings usually want revenge for wrongs, regardless of the social consequences. Therefore I see a wild swing towards matriarchy, and then a return to patriarchy and so forth and so on. There is even historical evidence to suggest many ancient cultures were matriarchal, and then became dominated by a patriarchal structure. 5 days agoflag  reply0Christopher_Cox  Incredulous:my problems are not with a EX wife , its the mother of my children . she just met the wrong guy who himself has to hide his life so its a case of a desperate woman and man . simple as that . all comes down to money , he cant work due to owing over 100k in child support and he found a sucker to support him , she don't want to loose him so she tried to get full custody of the children to get child support from me { before everything was split 50/50 and everyone was happy BUT that didn't pay the new mans bills so things changed NOW the kids got split up so no support for me or her NOW he wants her to get me put in jail to gain custody of the other child in order to get support from me to pay there bills . just taking it from day to day to see what else she pulls . the lies are catching up with them . 5 days agoflag  reply0cantucwearebrothers  shatteredmen:How EXACTLY is a woman being called a bitch less offensive than a man being called a prick? 5 days agoflag  reply+1shatteredmen  hammywill:The VAWA encourages false accusastions of DV because it assure women will get the kids and a hefty child support award.  I have talked to dozens upon dozens of men who have faced just this thing.  Funny, the courts cannot see that the accusations of abuse ONLY came in the midst of a heated divorce, often with the strong suggest of the lawyer and often feminist groups. 4 days agoflag  reply+1shatteredmen  hammywill:misogynisti?  I love how feminist love to throw that term around but they totall ignore MISANDRIST.Women do file for about 80% of the divorces.  I am sure money does come into play very often.  Perhaps wanting hubby to work overtime so she can buy.....but then complain about his not being around when he does so her attention turns to someone else.Oh remember Tiger Woods and how he got blasted by all the media and speaking heads....did you hear any of them say the women  he had the affairs with knew he was married for those who say they did not know a man was married, they knew he was not married to them so there is no excuse....and yes the man knew the woman he was sleeping with was not his wife so he was just as wrong too.  There is a very high cost for all of this:http://www.shatterdmen.com/HIDDEN%20COST.htm 4 days agoflag  reply+1shatteredmen  hammywill:IF you really are sorry about his situation get informed.  Find the real facts of domestic viokenc and that you will wnat to get the VAWA changed too!   We can give you ot of unbaised informaton on it and how the VAWA is making it MORE dangerous for everyone including women.  Billions of dollars and we have not seen on lick of results. 4 days agoflag  reply0shatteredmen  Incredulous:are you saying that if the law would just let the jilted husband beat the shit out of her, then he could keep everything, even his houseNO...but almost anywhere in the free world  WOMEN can do just that and if the man even defends himself, he is the one who will go to jail in most areas due to the mandatory arrest part of the VAWA.  Again, I have actually gotten it from state attorney generals that they will not prosecute women for domestic violence.

The bill was a collaborative effort, with key roles played by Victoria Nourse, then Senate Judiciary Committee counsel, and Sally Goldfarb, then NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund (NOW LDEF) staff attorney. A broad range of feminist groups offered input and support, and NOW LDEF's Pat Reuss lent lobbying expertise.Radical feminist wrote this act.  Would not this be like asking the klu klux klan  to write laws concerning racial relations?I ask you to substitute the word "women" in any of this with Black, Asians, or any other group.  Would it be fair?  Would it be Just?  Would it stand the test of the  Equal protection clause of the CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATESAmendment XIVSection 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. 4 days agoflag  reply+2shatteredmen  Christopher_Cox:ANYONE who hits another male or female should be dealt with by law B I N G O!!!!!!!There were already laws in every location in the nation regarding assault.  We did not need another one when the first was never enforced but the VAWA is adding to what is violence so if a man insults his wife (and it always works one way only) it can be called abuse.  Alla woman has to do in most places to get an order of protection is to say...I am afraid....Afraid of what?  That he will yell at you for racking up the credit card bills...or better yet that he will hack into your e-mail and find out  you are having an affair as one man did and he is now facing a 5 year prison term and she gets...all his things and a new honey.  One thing I would like to ask her new honey is....what makes you think she will not do this too....YOU?Chris of course you know the you in the above is not ...you! 4 days agoflag  reply+1shatteredmen  hammywill:So we can just throw out the equal protection clause?  Why not the whole US Constitution while we are at it....oh wait,,,,,they are already doing that aren't they?  Even the Feds admit that at least THIRITY EIGHT (38) percent of the abuse victims are men but they ignore that.  Oh, this 38% is in spite of many men being arrested for being abused which throws the stats off twice as fast as an abused man is listed on the stats as an abuser while an abusive woman is listed as the victim. Neat trick to build up the number of female victims isn't it? 4 days agoflag  reply0shatteredmen  cantucwearebrothers:You really do not know?

That is exactly how it's done. I hear the same painful stories every day about injustice in family court and even in criminal. Here is one particular case in Maine comes to mind about Mr.Filler . This case is simply outrageousness; the man and his children had enough of abuse by his wife and he decided to leave. But the wife with history of abusing the children and other men in her life out of revenge decided to make a claim of spousal rape to prevent Mr. Filler from removing himself and his children from her abuse. I have been following this story for a while now. My heart goes out to Mr.Filler and his children. The full story is here, fillerfund.com 4 days agoflag  reply+1justadad  MotherForTruth:with an Orwellian cypher, one may speculate that "VAWA" translates to Violence Against Families Act(ivist). 3 days agoflag  reply0justadad  shatteredmen:"Victoria Nourse" & "Sally Goldfarb" and "Pat Reuss" together with "Biden" should be defrocked.  Perhaps even formerly processed via RICO or other like "laws".  Look also to the counterpart attack associated with the replacement of "absent" with "NCP" within a formerly alleged "contract with America."  By my understanding, the trick was served around the Home Plate of American Apple Pie while an umpire for Veto was in conflict of interest postures due to a (at least then) preferred vocation of aroma therapies of/for amores.  (figuratively speaking)  Also, if I'm not further mistaken, the trick was buried within a "conforming amendment."  These members - alleged voices to we the people - are intelligent.
