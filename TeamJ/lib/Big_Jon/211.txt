I;m not going to call them out and start a discouse where its a shouting match but you  know who you are and thats pretty funny, I will share them privatly with those I know I can trust.  You can fool some of the people some of the time, then you can fool all of the people some of the time but you can never fool all of the people all of the time..  But I will say some of you try, but it doesn't work 6 days agoflag  reply+1DebEruptsAs popular provisions of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act keep rolling out, the path to repeal is going to get steeper politically for Republicans. With no real plan for anything to replace the current law, most opposition will be fruitless. Hopefully a public option will be added to the mandated insurance provision by 2014. 6 days agoflag  reply+2kennymotown  DebErupts:Very good contribution, I believe this is exactly what Kucinich is banking on! 6 days agoflag  reply+3tommicOh no trolls at work again  do you people know how used you are, of course not your morons, everyone knows your morons thats why you do what you do, you never had an original thought of your own 6 days agoflag  reply+2kennymotown  tommic:It is in fact, a clear and present danger when trolls are sent out to the blogisphere and distort the truth they are and have been either hired by the evil forces or they are just plain brainwashed! 6 days agoflag  reply+2tommic  kennymotown:The time has come to call them out everyday without exception with no mercy. They show none themselves so if its the insult game they wish to play, I can play hardball as good as them in all likelyhood even better, but when i matured I thought that type of behavior childish. But its all they know, so thats what they'll get. I'm plain fuckin tired of their shit 6 days agoflag  reply+1kennymotown  tommic:Yep, they are doing the business of our corporate overlords! 6 days agoflag  reply+7mybolognaThe biggest difference between European countries and the U.S. is that here people are afraid of the government while in Europe the government is scared of the people. The government in many European countries was created to create consensus and be accountable to the people. That is why they have a better social safety net than we do. The U.S. government was created by slave owning oligarchs whos main priority was to keep their own  wealth and power.I'm not saying that the U.S. constitution was not a great document, but to say that it is perfect, that only the forefathers knew best how to create government, and think of them as infalible demi-gods is naive and irresponsible. They even knew that it was a flawed document. That's why they put in a mecanism in it to make changes. We the people didn't mean all the people back then.If we have a better government for and by the people, it should serve the interests of society at large. Instead, our government functions more efficiently, as it was created to do, to preserve the wealth and powerstructure of the oligarchy. That is why our taxes go to wars to acquire oil for American corporations. That's why our taxes go mostly toward corporate subsidies. I do understand why Americans are suspicious of government.Unfortunately, the same people who are for wars to guard corporate interests are also against the most  legitimate use of government: to provide for the common welfare. Our citizens are so brainwashed by the corporate propaganda that they would rather have their tax money kill foreigners abroad than to heal their own family here at home.When the healthcare system is based on profit, it is more profitable to keep the clients sick. What is more profitable, to cure with one visit or to treat a disease for a long time? Keep the oligarchs happy, give them more power and money, keep the for profit healthcare system. 7 days agoflag  reply+1tommic  mybologna:Well said and well written post 7 days agoflag  reply+1kennymotown  mybologna:I second that (tommic) well said! 6 days agoflag  reply+2opit  mybologna:"Our citizens are so brainwashed by the corporate propaganda that they would rather have their tax money kill foreigners abroad than to heal their own family here at home."Actually, at least 63% of Americans oppose 'war' in the sandbox of Afghanistan. It is useful for corporate 'media' propagandists to represent themselves as accurate  reporters of polls which are useful to drive people into a staged conformity which has no basis in reality.This use of 'push polls' is one of the tools used to 'Move the Overton Window' of what is considered reasonable.http://opitslinkfest.blogspot.com/2009/07/perception-alteration.html 6 days agoflag  reply0jj2010  mybologna:Well put 5 days agoflag  reply-9Sparky2UKucinich is a mealy mouthed troll. 7 days agoflag  reply+1kennymotown  Sparky2U:Takes one to know one! 7 days agoflag  reply+4kennymotown  Sparky2U:Takes one too know one! 7 days agoflag  reply+1insaintity  Sparky2U:Please offer evidence. 7 days agoflag  reply0tommic  Sparky2U:pot calling the kettle black LOL 6 days agoflag  reply0noxidereus  Sparky2U:How ironic that you used the word "troll".

Did it ever occur to you that we do indeed have the financial wherewithall to provide healthcare for every american if we didn't waste so much money to kill, maime, and destroy countries for the military industrial complex and for corporate America like the oil companies. Your sheep being led to slaughter almost as helpless as th 6 million Jews who voluntarly boarded trains never to return. An apt analogy 7 days agoflag  reply+7kennymotown  tommic:Yep, a bunch of ignorant sheep with their eye lids taped wide open watching FOX, and listening to Lintballs! 7 days agoflag  reply+3tommic  kennymotown:I don't know why I waste my time here, the really smart people seem not to be here, their at NYTimes online or Washington post online, the daily Kos online but kenny Current has gone WAY down hill in the last two yearsKenny you want to read really intelligent postings from both side of the aisle go to NYTimes online Op ed and editorials and read comments and post yourself I do every day at about 1-3 am thats where the action is now 7 days agoflag  reply+3kennymotown  tommic:You are right about that! I noticed a severe drop in responsible comments when we got stuck with that terrible healthcare bill. Only proves we need single payer to get some of these people some real mental healthcare. 7 days agoflag  reply+3Aaron_BrutusThis country needs that healthcare bill ((sigh)). . .why cant people see that? 7 days agoflag  reply+7hammywill  Aaron_Brutus:Actually, Health Insurance IS the problem. The best thing that could ever happen would be if all Health Insurance companies were either outlawed or went out of business. 7 days agoflag  reply-1oppressed1  Aaron_Brutus:another free thing for you hu.? Didn't you say the best part about free health care was that whitey was going to have tp pay for it. 7 days agoflag  reply0Aaron_Brutus  oppressed1:Excuse me? Do you even know me? My family has health care. unlike you I am able to think of others besides myself you. . .racist prick. 4 days agoflag  reply+3tomofnorthcalRemember, anything the House Crazy Corporate Republicans does, must be ratified by the Senate, then avoid a veto by the Prez. 7 days agoflag  reply+7tommicSingle payer is coming the promise by the gOP to revoke healthcare reform will be the the point when it comes to the fore. The whole watering down of healthcare reform by republicans is the biggest reason for the incredible insurance rate increases that now threaten pension and retirement programs. State and local budgets which have been subject to increases from 30 to 70 percent. Rape the system is what the conservative amendments to the healthcare reform bill did that were added and in the end no gop anybodys voted for it. Thats bipartisian? My ass, welcome single payer 7 days agoflag  reply+2kennymotown  tommic:Well said! 7 days agoflag  reply0treewolf39  tommic:Are they really talking like this at the NY Times? I mean health care expense IS the elephant sucking the jobs from our economy. Single payer needs to happen to properly leverage our future success and health. 7 days agoflag  reply+1tommic  treewolf39:Well yes they are, the trolls here will call the lefty lib NYTimes just that, but the truth is when you read the articles pertaining to healthcare a very wide cross section is waking up to the fact that the republicans watered down both healthcare reofm legislation and financial reform legislation, and in both cases favored big biz over everything else. There quite literally is on every occasion where Healthcare is spoken the realization the we made a terrible mistake capitulating, attempting to forge a bipartisian consensus for the betterment of the country, when in reality it did more harm than good. I would say, (my opinion) that the republican attempt to repeal HCR will result in an even stronger, progressive/liberal/independent coalition that will bring single payer forward and hundreds of post written attest to this. Remember this as well, not every small business owner in America is a right wing republican conservative who believes in smaller government. These guys are being strangled as well with HUGE increases in premiums that stand to make them uncompetitive in the international arena and choke the domestic profit.Wow , that enough for this moment my fingers are tired. LOL 7 days agoflag  reply0treewolf39  tommic:Sounds hopeful. 6 days agoflag  reply0opit  tommic:The reports of the period leading up to introduction of the new legislation were that Obama's offices were closed to single-payer proponents and lobbyists had free access. drinking liberally in new milford had lots of info on this - and was extremly cynical about Ezra Klein's loyalties...though Ezra's 'Health of Nations' reports have highlighted foreign success rates of their policies for years. I do recall reports of both Obama and Clinton being highly 'indebted' to insurance scam money for their electoral funds. That should be easy enough to check. 6 days agoflag  reply+1shanklinmikeHey, in other places around the world you don't get to choose your slavedriver....At least here you get to choose from slavedriver republican or slavedriver democrat....In the end, they are all the same though, at least on the issues that matter....Politics is a joke, END IT! 7 days agoflag  reply0noxidereus  shanklinmike:The slave drivers are the corporations. The government is us. The masses need to wake up and actually act like it is us and make it work for us instead of working for the slave-driving corporations. Libertarianism is the quickest way to slavery because it seeks to yield our power even further to big business. It seeks to remove the rights of workers to a fair wage. It seeks to remove consumers rights to safe products, etc. It seeks to make the rich richer and the poor into voiceless, powerless slaves. 6 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  noxidereus:Libertarianism does not advocate any such thing. To assert that it does is HUGELY ignorant. 6 days agoflag  reply+2ThatCrazyLibertarianDon't worry Kenny.

Sorry 'bout that.  It still is the holiday. 7 days agoflag  reply0kennymotown  ThatCrazyLibertarian:Your probably right about that, but single payer is one of the main planks of the people's revolutionary army's platform! 7 days agoflag  reply0kennymotown  ThatCrazyLibertarian:That would be the PRA! 7 days agoflag  reply+1shanklinmike  ThatCrazyLibertarian:Agreed 7 days agoflag  reply+2shanklinmike  kennymotown:True, it gives the neocons something to rally against....making the warmongers stronger.... oh, that's right...the democrats are ALSO warmongers.... Holy shit are we fucked....all due to government coercion! 7 days agoflag  reply+7neocongoIncredibly naive to think single payer would replace what we now have.  Should the GOP repeal our new healthcare, it would be replaced with NOTHING.  Do you really think a GOP majority in the House is going to pass single payer?  That's just plain stupid. 7 days agoflag  reply+1kennymotown  neocongo:I think public outrage will win the day neo, it's a matter of time! 7 days agoflag  reply+3neocongo  kennymotown:Obama can an will veto any such repeal. 7 days agoflag  reply0kennymotown  neocongo:Exactly, and when this debate heats up with the extreme right wing trying everything they can too destroy it, a change to medicare "E" will be thrown into the mix. I can see a huge change coming to refine the bill. I am not going to fall into despair over the fact that we got everything that we could in Obama care, cause it needs fixing and the outrage that surrounded this peticular bill will continue for years. 7 days agoflag  reply+2BrushwithDeathToothpaste  kennymotown:We've seen the people's outrage.  That is why there is a Republican congress.  Republicans are much better at marketing.  When you are more concerned with what happens on Jersey Shore rather than your unemployed neighbor, you get misguided outrage. 7 days agoflag  reply+1BrushwithDeathToothpaste  neocongo:Yes then Fox News can really slop on the phrase "government takeover of health care."  I really doubt it will happen. 7 days agoflag  reply+1kennymotown  BrushwithDeathToothpaste:Yes indeed! 7 days agoflag  reply-2shanklinmike  kennymotown:Public outrage is what is shutting down this harmful government monopoly in the first place....too bad the public can't get the government out of insurance as well.... it has led to skyrocketing costs and protectionist efforts through oligopolization of big business!Government is ALWAYS overrun by corporatists....they want to use the government guns for their advantage like Al Capone....Government will NEVER be for you, the small person. NEVER.Only individual rights will protect you and enable more prosperity.Get the government out of our insurance as well! Don't FORCE me to buy corporatist health insurance! The whole system has been interlaced with government coercion since before we were ever alive.Fuck slavery! 7 days agoflag  reply0shanklinmike  kennymotown:and neocon republicans who called for Medicare are statists also.... fools 7 days agoflag  reply+1kennymotown  shanklinmike:Join The People's Revolutionary Army! PRA, PRA. 7 days agoflag  reply+5jubal  shanklinmike:You know Shank...you are completely wrong...it isn't because of government that costs are skyrocketing. It is because of the greedy insurance corporations. They fuck the patients and the doctors...patients with higher premiums and doctors with higher premiums. Have you seen how difficult it is anymore to bring about a lawsuit for malpractice? Nearly fucking impossible. So there is no justification to say that malpractice costs are so high that insurance premiums should be so high. Its because there is no federal regulation strong enough to hold down the costs. Free markets are not what is needed in healthcare and we have decades of evidence to prove that. What is needed is a not for profit medical system...because medical and dental care are rights that we should have as citizens. If you want to buy a cadillac...that is your choice, but everybody needs to at least have the right to public transportation....if you can appreciate my analogy.You libertarians think that everything is going to be solved with capitalist anarchy...that is complete and utter bullshit and you are disingenuous thinking that freedom and liberty are going to stop greed and discrimination. Stop living in a fantasy world.We need tough government oversight to stop the corruption of corporate greed. 7 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  kennymotown:I am not the biggest fan of Neocongo, but...he is not wrong here. Since when has public outrage ever affected a change in governmental policy? Elected officials from both parties don't give a shit about what the people think...they know that no matter what, they will keep getting elected. History has shown the American people will continue to elect Democrats and Republicans...at WORST they have a 50/50 chance of winning in EVERY single election, and a 100% chance of having enough people in Congress to have enough control over legislation that it does not matter. This is a game being played with the American people.In fact, I am surprised the Republicans are against this Health Care bill since it forces people to buy a product from a private, FOR PROFIT Corporation. While everyone fails to comprehend that Congress is asserting they have the right to regulate YOU AND ME under the Commerce Clause. 7 days agoflag  reply-1Sparky2U  neocongo:They will simply override his veto 7 days agoflag  reply-1Sparky2U  kennymotown:Still playin with the GI Joe's huh Kenny? 7 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  Sparky2U:How exactly will they do that when they do not have even a simple majority in the Senate, let alone a 2/3 majority in either house? 7 days agoflag  reply0treewolf39  hammywill:Public outrage got us out of Vietnam and civil rights. Guess your right. Not much use in the last 37 years.  ....... Wait...... Public outrage may have got us Obama.  http://republicinpieces.tripod.com/flu2.jpg 7 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  treewolf39:U.S. Involvement in the Vietnam War began in 1950 and did not end until 1975. 25 years long involvement in that war...seems as if Public Outrage did very little. You're right about Obama though. We got the same thing we have been getting for the last 120 years...way to go Public outrage! 7 days agoflag  reply+3observer2121Single payer is the only way to go. 7 days agoflag  reply+3kennymotown  observer2121:And the majority of citizens agree, last time I checked over 70%. Kind of makes you wonder doesn't it? 7 days agoflag  reply-1shanklinmike  observer2121:Actually, not monopolizing us to violence is an option.... the entire system we know today is already trapped to government insurance corporatist. I say end that as well! Don't FORCE me to buy insurance from one of the big businesses! That is not moral. In fact, don't FORCE PEACEFUL people to do anything they don't want to do. How about that?!? If you got rid of government, the corporatist state we live in today would crumble along with its government protectionism. You guys are going the wrong way on this issue.... just like the republicans calling for more government wars.... 7 days agoflag  reply+1hammywill  shanklinmike:As an Anarchist, I have to say I agree with your end game. But I will say this, people do not know how to handle freedom. When people stop acting in a way that demands they be governed, then there will be no need for government. The people today are not capable of dealing with freedom. There has to be a transition and/or a change in the social mindset before that is a feasible option. Until then, it is insane to advocate for an instantaneous revocation of all Governments. 7 days agoflag  reply+3miles_ahead  shanklinmike:Individual freedom is worth nothing without the protection of Government. Your position boils down to a shack and a shot gun. People want more than that. That is why the Founding Fathers delineated the purpose of Government in the Declaration of Independence, and the structure and function of Government in the Constitution. Government is the People's only protection against Corporate greed, corruption, and rapaciousness. If Government were ended, we would be entirely at the mercy of giant private interests, which have demonstrated that murder, both individual and wholesale, not to mention Environmental, is perfectly acceptable in the pursuit of profit.  The reason people don't trust Government today is not because it is inherently evil, but because corporatism has already infiltrated it to such a large degree. What is really needed is not elimination of Government, but elimination of corruption from Government. The Declaration of Independence states that Government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed. The Constitution outlines how this is to be achieved. The founding documents of the USA have been admired and copied around the world, yet you would consign them to the trash can. Personally, my vote stays with the Constitution. 7 days agoflag  reply-1hammywill  miles_ahead:Not sure your ideas about the Founding Father's is entirely accurate."Government is not reason; it is not eloquent; it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master." - George Washington 7 days agoflag  reply+3miles_ahead  hammywill:Washington was, of course, suspicious of government. There had not been many examples of good government in the world. Yet he was also convinced of the necessity of good government:"To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a Government for the whole is indispensable."  -George WashingtonYou can take quotes out of context to support almost any twisted argument. The beauty of the Declaration and the Constitution was that they were the clearest statement of human freedom and the right to self-government, and the greatest design for government to ensure this freedom, that had ever emerged in the history of the human race. They have not been equaled, much less surpassed, to this day.  Of course, there were a few problems. Freedom and suffrage, once only for white males, has now been extended to all, but the Founding Fathers were doing pretty well for their times. 7 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  miles_ahead:Government and Freedom are mutually exclusive concepts by their very nature. You can have a MEASURE of freedom with a government, you can even have a LOT of freedom with a government. But you can not be free and governed at the same time. I will say this though, humankind is not, at this point, capable of being free. 7 days agoflag  reply+1gerardange  miles_ahead:Very well said, and very true.    The overwhelming underlying issue before all of us is... government corruption.  Corruption deeply infesting the Executive, Political and Judicial branches of our government.      What are your thoughts in regard to removing the many corrupt individuals that have sold out all the Rights, the Health and the Wealth of all of the American citizens for personal profit?         Then, what are your ideas to correct the core underlying problems that allowed that corruption to develop ?Gerard 7 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  gerardange:A general strike and nullify every unconstitutional law that they are asked to judge. 7 days agoflag  reply0miles_ahead  hammywill:Government and Freedom are not antithetical. You can't build your own road from Los Angeles to New York. Government is the way we do together that which we can't do alone. Under your system, every road would be a toll road, and crossing the country would be a fearful undertaking, menaced by gang warfare and private armies. It could take weeks, or even months, and you might be killed, or captured and enslaved along the way. We can only work to eliminate corruption from Government, and make the path of Public Service more attractive to intelligent people. 7 days agoflag  reply0gerardange  miles_ahead:miles_ahead,  this question was directed at you not hammywill:  Again...The overwhelming underlying issue before all of us is... government corruption. Corruption deeply infesting the Executive, Political and Judicial branches of our government.What are your thoughts in regard to removing the many corrupt individuals that have sold out all the Rights, the Health and the Wealth of all of the American citizens for personal profit?Then, what are your ideas to correct the core underlying problems that allowed that corruption to develop ?Gerard 7 days agoflag  reply0hammywill  miles_ahead:Your assumption is that any road not built by a government would automatically be a toll road. This is not an inherent proposition, it is a supposed proposition. It does not take a government to get people to work together. The Amish community seems to get a long just fine with no government. 7 days agoflag  reply+1hammywill  miles_ahead:For the record, I am not advocating the abolishment of Government. At least not currently. People are not capable of that sort of freedom at this time in human development, I am idealist, which makes me an Anarchist. But I would never advocate an instant overthrow of all governments anymore than I would tell a person who just had a bypass to remove his stitches. It would be fatal. But in time, IF the human condition changes...then perhaps those stitches which hold us together COULD be removed. But that is for the future to decide. 7 days agoflag  reply+1treewolf39  hammywill:The Amish are a government unto themselves. They agree in belief and purpose. Every society has government whether it is a counsel of elders or a one person show. (Dictator) Our country can't seem to agree to treat people decently. One group wants to rule the rest and that is NOT how a democracy works. 6 days agoflag  reply+1treewolf39  hammywill:It seems to be in our nature to look for a leader. I am with you in the hope that human kind can evolve to be thoughtfully independent. 6 days agoflag  reply+1miles_ahead  gerardange:That is a big question, and a tall order. I would never pretend to have all the answers to such a question, but it suggests a growth of public consciousness, such that many more people feel motivated to get involved in public life. This would require that the media-saturated minds of the masses of people begin to become alert to their condition of corporate servitude. I stopped watching TV a long time ago, because most of it was insulting to my intelligence. I am not the only person who has done this, and it could catch on. But even if we are awake & informed, there remains the problem of the infestation of Government with corporate cockroaches, and the fact that violence is still acceptable as a means of accomplishing political goals. Hammywill suggests the example of the Amish. Yes, they do seem to live peacefully and ethically without government, but they are a small group, localized, with a deep traditional bond. How can today's mass societies achieve this? We intuit that it is possible. Perhaps the troubles of the world today are the birth pangs of a higher order of civilization. 6 days agoflag  reply+1miles_ahead  hammywill:I do agree that human beings are capable of a higher level of civilization. We know this, because we can find it within our selves. Those of us who are relatively lucky and undamaged know that primate psychology is not the end of the story for us. We are born with strong drives toward peaceful cooperation, altruism and idealism. We would love to be a part of a better world. Not everyone sees this. Not everyone has been so lucky. And this includes some of the most financially fortunate, who still take a dim view of humanity, and believe private armies are necessary to protect their plunder, while the masses can be left to starve. If you can see the future, keep talking about it. The world needs its idealists. 6 days agoflag  reply0Mikey_PogoloffKucinich is the man, although I don't see this happening.  He is now being advised by one of my favorite economists Michael Hudson, Kucinich 2012!  As far as health care, I really don't care if I have to buy it from Wal-Mart or I am forced into some Gubment "death panel," as long as it is affordable.  I am THAT desperate, haha. 7 days agoflag  reply+1kennymotown  Mikey_Pogoloff:Yep, I think before this year is over there will be millions desperate! 7 days agoflag  reply0PressCore  Mikey_Pogoloff:If you realy are, then perhaps you'll be open to a suggestion: I openeda free checking account with Key commercial bank in early 2007. I'vehad an account with them ever since. Out of the blue, I got a telephonecall in later 2010 from one of their marketing reps which provided me with a group plan through the National Union Fire Insurance Company. I know. It seemed odd to me that a fire insurance company would provide plans for private disability coverage, medical visits, and even alternate plans. And that all members of Key bank would be covered under class 1, eligible spouses under class 2, and eligible dependent children underclass 3.  Coverage amounts automaticly increase every 3 months until the coverage levels double, though premiums remain constant. Thisis a $10,000 initial disability policy with monthly payouts, and physicans office visits coverage of $100 per family per quarter. Monthly premium is$19.90.
