WHY A NEWSPAPER? WHY THE RAG? By the end of July of 1970, Gormlie and Susan were moving back to their house on Etiwanda Street  a house purchased by her family in late 68. What with that house, and his parents owning a home in Point Loma since the early fifties, Gormlie already had ties to the community of Ocean Beach. He had both body and board surfed its waves since he was 13; his uncle and namesake had owned the OB Camera for years, his mother had worked there after his father, having retired from the Army in early 1961, lost his job at Convair in the recession of the early sixties. Many of his friends from high school were from OB.1968: The Rowdy College-Surf Town Morphs Into Hippie HavenOB was already well-known for its rowdy and irreverent culture of beach, surf & beer; but by 1968, it began its transformation into something more. Bleach blond long-haired surfers lived next door to long-haired hippies, and soon you couldnt tell them apart. It became official: Ocean Beach had become the hippie mecca. Since the late sixties, Ocean Beach had morphed into the hippie hangout for the entire city. OB had become the Haight-Ashbury of San Diego, shadowing the more famous early birthplace of hippie-ism. But if you were young and a hippie in San Diego, you ended up in OB.Before it was a hippie town, Ocean Beach was a college beach town, filled with students and surfers. Typical of such summer-oriented youthful beach towns  little more than sand arenas of beer-energized crowds on those the hot days, there was an innate rebelliousness. It was like the atmosphere of a constant spring break hanging in the air.Over the springs and summers near the end of the decade, there had been a number of rowdy confrontations with police officers  usually on a hot day  usually beginning near the foot of Newport, when water balloons  careening through the crowds  got out of hand. The cops would arrive, and then they would become the targets. There had been the famous Easter Riots.On one occasion, the skirmishing between police and locals became so intense and out of control, that the police chief himself, fresh from the golf course, arrived to personally direct house-to-house searches, as his officers sought those sandy scofflaws. During those days, young Doug Porter, right out of Point Loma High School, collaborating with Norm and other locals, had been publishing OBs very first underground newspaper, The OB Liberator. Their next issue had an enlarged photograph of this head of police, clad in his golf shirt, standing in the middle of the street on the last block of Long Branch, waving his hands as he directed his officers, some of whom can be seen upstairs on the porch of a two-storied building going door-to-door. (Porter would later work on the OB Rag, and eventually end up a major writer on the San Diego Door in the mid-seventies.)OB As An Insurgent CommunityOcean Beach, then, for Gormlie, presented itself as one of those college communities where the new politics were sprouting. OB had no college itself, but its beach cottages and apartments were filled with students from State, UCSD, Cal-Western not far away. OB was a college town without a college. He likened it to those other insurgent neighborhoods like Isla Vista, Berkeley, Ann Arbor, where, with idealism perhaps stronger than realism, there were real efforts being manifested in creating alternative social-structures within those communities, alternatives to establishment values and institutions.Tom Hayden, the well-known activist, had written of such insurgent communities. He advocated radicals establishing beachheads of progressive politics within the college towns that surrounded the exploding college campuses. Gormlie read him and took him literally. OB was going to be one of these beachheads. Community organizing was where it was at, he thought. This was where he was coming from, when he convinced his close friend and fellow UCSD radical, John Lyons to move to OB and in his discussions with Bo Blakey, the third member of the first OB Rag core, over what to do politically  once they settled in at the Etiwanda house.STREET JOURNAL  San Diegos First Political Underground NewspaperGormlie had been inspired by San Diegos early underground or alternative newspapers, particularly the San Diego Street Journal. The Street Journal, originally the San Diego Free Press, had been organized by a collective of students and grad students from UCSD. Upon the assassination of Martin Luther King in April of 1968, this collective had formed, had moved off campus to be more relevant, and began publishing the Free Press out of an old beat-up, two-storied Victorian house between Hillcrest and downtown. They changed their name to the Street Journal, and took on the establishment  and made history. The Street Journals campaign against C. Arnholt Smith  Mr. San Diego of 1960  a major kingpin in local banking and power circles  was instrumental in helping to bring his corrupt empire down. But all this was yet to come. Gormlie saw the potential of a newspaper as a wonderful organizing tool.There were days when Gormlie felt that journalism was in his blood. He had led renditions of student newspapers during his grade school days, he had written an article or two for UCSDs radical student newspaper, but he had no formal journalistic training. Having found himself to be an activist at heart at college, this tug of war between his journalistic side and his activist side would plague him for decades. But in the summer of 1970, Gormlie wanted some kind of vehicle, some kind of in for his anticipated community organizing. He also understood the power of words  having been a good writer throughout his academic career, and he understood that the power to define events was potentially earthshaking. There was a tradition in this country  starting with Ben Franklin  of the little newspaper standing up and criticizing the rulers. Now, inspired by the Street Journal, Gormlie wanted to do an underground newspaper. It seemed like an excellent idea.The Rag Gets a NameWhat about a name? Gormlie had heard about and read an alternative newspaper from Austin, Texas, called The Austin Rag. It sounded very cool, as rag was often used to describe a newspaper derogatorily. Open a Websters New Collegiate Dictionary, and look up rag and in bold capital letters youll find at definition number (3), the word, NEWSPAPER.Feeling a certain pride about the community, the future editor wished to enhance its identity and reputation. There was the Austin Rag; he had a subscription to the Berkeley Barb, had read the LA Free Press many times, had seen the Village Voice. OB had to be in the name. So, it was to be the OB Rag, but Gormlie wanted something in its name to signify that the paper belonged to the community, to the people of the community  it became the OB Peoples Rag.That Fall  in September, when its still hot in San Diego, the first issues were published. Over those first months, the paper settled into publishing every other week  twice a month. It was generally able to keep this publishing schedule over the five years it lasted. It evolved from a scrappy, mimeographed and stapled hand-out to a full-fledged newspaper on newsprint, respected and supported within the community. The Rag evolved into a real community newspaper. Its staff changed several times over those years during the first half of the seventies  three times just within the first year. But the Rag survived and thrived, reaching its peak somewhere in mid or late 1974. It was printing 5000 issues, had an office on Newport, and had staff meetings comprised of a dozen people. Art Kunkin, then the publisher of The LA Free Press, the grandparent of West Coast underground newspapers, once called the OB Rag, the best community newspaper in the country.The OB Rag  the Long ViewThe Rags vibrant and brilliant young staffs, energized and wise before their age, were knowledgable and on top of the most important and significant issues facing Ocean Beach in those days. On the international and national level, the War, of course, was the big issue. Locally, the threat of gentrification and over-development (Miami Beachization), more than any other immediate and OB issue was consistently challenged by the Rag. The Precise Plan  the urban plan that would have drastically transformed the community and in the process, uprooted much of the poor and youth within the population, was met headon by the Rag. In conjunction with local environmentalists, the Rag helped lead the creation of a successful alternative to the plan. The paper led on many other issues, as well: the lack of adequate childcare, organic food, sexism within the community and within the counter-culture, community control of the police, the list goes on. Often staff members were leaders in their own right in many of the various organizations and alternative institutions that were being created and developed within the community.Over time, the Rag, in reflecting the trials and tribulations of the community, did give voice to the new sub-culture with its distinctive left-wing irreverant attitude. It blended news and activism and became an outlet for journalistic, artistic, poetic and organizing talents. Importantly, it connected Ocean Beach politically with the rest of the world and it tried, at first very raw, to bring the best politics to OB. It was local and internationalist at the same time.Not only did the OB Rag reflect the new counter-culture and its adherents within the community, not only did it provide an outlet for homegrown voices of left-wing populism and solidarity, and not only did it lead the seaside neighborhood in many issues, it was responding to a critical need of a sub-culture that was bursting through the seams of the traditional culture, and all the while, being suppressed by the mainstream culture. It needed a voice, a sympathetic voice.(continue to Summer 1970) Share|Pages: 1 2 3 { 24 comments read them below or add one }Evonne SchulzeNovember 2, 2007 at 11:14 pmImagine my surprise when i ran into Genie Phllips and she told me the Ob Rag was back and Frank was still in there plugging!!!!!I wish you great success and I am going to spread the word to some of the oldies that are still around.  This is great.  Maybe we can even get a few stories about what once was and that nothing has truly changed, etc.I will stay in touch.cheers, evonneReplyNancy 22November 25, 2007 at 3:02 amThanks for the site.This oldie wants to say.I do recall the old days.The beaches were actually clean.2000 the last time I visited with the grandchildren I told them there used to be abalone in the tide pools under the pier before their dad was born. Another war and a generation later the Ocean Beach Rag is sill alive and so is Hope.The Rag and the folks that worked on the paper ment Hope and struggle to show that there is something else an alternitave to repression. Would some one else share what the Rag ment to them? ThanksKeep on Keeping OnLittleReplyClark DeLeonDecember 10, 2007 at 12:07 pmCongratulations on the OB CyberRag.  I worked on an underground/alternative weekly in Philadelphia called The Drummer in the early 1970s and also the daily student newspaper at Temple University.  This prepared me for the day when I would become a columnist at The Philadelphia Inquirer, which I was for more than 20 years. I currently write a column for the Philadelphia Metro.  I give this as background just to show you that Ive been there, done that.  Which is why I appreciated the story of the origin of the OB People Rag.  My sister and brother-in-law, Denise and Stuart Seymour, have lived in OB for almost two decades.  My family gets to visit for a week almost every summer, and I love the OB vibe.  Weve got a section of Philadelphia called South Street, which is like Newport Avenue  with the Delaware River at the end instead of the Pacific Ocean. South street was the result of the same kind of political and community awakening that took place in OB during the late 60s and early 70s.  I can report that your east coast hippie cousins are still rocking the establishment, establishing justice, working with rather than against the environment, living large and taking responsibility for their communities.   The activists of old have become the parents and grandparents of today.  And they havent sold out (not all of them, anyway).  It was a great time to come of age and I still see its spirit alive and well in the biker bars and coffee houses, in the Chop Shop art gallery and on the sideways of Ocean Beach.Clark DeLeonReplyzarielDecember 28, 2009 at 6:38 pmOnly in OB could a mix like this have happened. Does anyone remember the original OB peoples food store located in the small [bike?] shop before it moved up the street into a rebuilt pool hall? The OB free school? Hallelujah michael? Eru, Skyhorse Largo or any number of rare and unforgettable characters that lent this funky beach town its quite original vibe that gave this Philly boy a mental makeover thats lasted a lifetime. Good to see you still groovinReplyFrank GormlieDecember 28, 2009 at 6:42 pmZariel  check out our series on OB Peoples Food Co-op  which includes a photo of the old store front.ReplyMarjorie Ann DrakeMarch 19, 2008 at 3:52 pmWowie, I guess were getting old, hmmmm?  Anyone remember the Red House and the DC Blues Band?Oh yea, and Spacemanwhat a trip.  Thanks you guys, outasight.ReplyFrank GormlieMay 6, 2008 at 9:59 pmMarjorie  sure we remember the Red House. It will be referenced, I understand, in up-coming additions to the OB Rag history, as yet unwritten. The Red House was an activist home during most of the seventies, painted red, and was a center for the radical antiwar movement in OB . The structure still stands today, but the lot has been divided.I also remember the DC Blues Band. And Spaceman. I met him when I was a teenager and still have my Space Number, which will save me when the aliens land. Hey, when are they landing? We need something in this country.ReplyWinstonJuly 16, 2008 at 5:30 pmI lived in OB in the early to mid 60s. In  1965 I was 5 years old. Spaceman would come by our house from time to time. We lived on Coronado Ave. until the house we rented was sold and the land used to build apartments. One time Spaceman tried to get me to take money from my mothers purse to give to him. I remember people talking about his drinking. At that time he was pretty old. I think he made the news from time to time. I now reside in Tennessee.ReplyRay GavinDecember 7, 2009 at 6:00 pmWe moved into OB in 1954. we lived on seaside st and went to sacred heart academy. We were a big family 9 boys and 2 girls and of course we were catholic. early on i remember knowing the location of every fruit tree in the neighborhood. we played in the canyon at the north end of seaside. the trek to  beach was a daily summer routine. Down the street lived the Lockwoods and Ray Baumbaugh. Ob was a very quiet place to grow up in. The old house is still there at 2319. Phil meeker, dennis brooks, ronnie green, the lucido family and the bettencourts. Hangin out at the Rec center. I sold papers on Newport st in 57 and 58. The frichtels and Shermans. Always did a little shoplifting at Cornets. I loved the fries at the jack in the box on the coner of froud and sunset cliffs. Paul, one of my brothersthe Wolf.on his velsey-jacobs board. I remeber going to see Endless summer in 58 at the loma theaterwow ..what a time..ReplyFrank GormlieDecember 7, 2009 at 6:31 pmRay, wow, what a treasure trove of memories! I also lived on Seaside but much later. I went to high school with some of the Lockwoods and Marty Bettencourt. The only thing I differ with you about is when the original Endless Summer was shown. It was more like 1963 to 1964.  I saw it at the PB elementary school auditorium and the producer  I forget his name  gave a live narrative.ReplyLorne HillierDecember 28, 2009 at 6:24 pmGreetings OB! Ray, I am sure you remember one or the other Hillier at Sacred Heart, since there 12 of us! Your sister was in my classyep I did the tour from Kindergarten to 8th grade there, then on to Uni after that! Lots of religion in those days! Theresa was in my class with the Caseys,Beckmans, Lucidos and many more ( well NOT that manyI think we had 12 boys and about 18-20 girls in our class) We lived on the 4400 block of Santa Monicastraight up from the Tower..we checked the surf every day from the middle of the streetcounting the sets. The one thing I miss the most is the chicken from Ma and Pa ZekesI wonder if that recipe ever was passed along? It sure beat KFC all to hell!Replysteve ottingerJanuary 11, 2010 at 4:52 pmWow Frank! you lived on seaside too? and you remember the lockwoods? our house was strait across the street from the lockwoods! it was the big ugly pink house with the pillers. hell, Jimmy lockwood dam neer lived at our house. you also remember the Motts? these were some of our  good friends! Do you or any one els here remember the Ottinger family? we were well known as well.  I sure do miss the OB days, we left OB in 1974 and moved to coos bay oregon. It was one of the biggist mistakes my folks ever made. in fact to be totaly honest with you. In my life! I dont remember ever being as happy as I was as a young kid in ocean beach. When we left! I left my heart in  ocean beach, and took OB with me insted, to a place where Calis were not welcomed. It seemed the bikers here were the only ones who ever really did exsept me for who and what I was. But at the time a lot of them were from Cali as well, and no one here wanted to fuck around with  these boys. Now 44yrs old with unproudly! two murder trials under my belt. I fined my self once again facing yet another tial! one that ive ran from for 9yrs! wich is coming to an end this spring when I turn my self in, and if it goes well! then Im done with the law! once and for all!! Its time for some peace, love , and happyness to come my way again.  wish me luck my brother! and thanks again.. truly The OB- Kid!ReplyWayne RocheMay 24, 2010 at 3:21 pmWhat a blast from the past! I moved to California when I was 23 and went straight from the east coast, to Ocean Beach. I lived at a few places in O.B between March 78, and November, 79, but I started out in a very modest apartment above the shoe store on the corner of Newport and Bacon. Being from the NY suburbs, (New Rochelle, just north of NYC),  O.B. was sort of a culture shockone I embraced with open arms, and an open mind!  Like most kids my age at that time, I had this preconceived notion that I was going to be hangin out with alot of blonde, blue eyed Californians, listening to the Beach Boys while cruisin around in a T-Bird or a 49 Ford Woody with my long board bungeed to the topKawabunga!!!.wrong.Instead, it was a melting pot of souls from all over the countrythe world! In fact I do actually remember meeting one girl from San Diegoonly one. And NOBODY listened to the Beach Boys! Ok. Some of my fondest memories are:  Sunshine Co. Saloon, Clint Carey(The Spaceman), The Arizona at 6 in the morning!, The Black (my favorite head shop), Square Pan Pizza, Over the Top, Foggys Notion, learning to surf, and the partiesoh lord, the parties! But mostly, the people. Although my time in O.B. was only for two years, I met some of the finest people in my 54 years on this planet. I love and miss all of themPatti-Jo, Phil, Gypsy, Richard, Terra, and the list is just too long to type! I guess this is just me sharing some nostalgia with you. Sort of a walk down memory lane for me. You know, its funnyIve been asked over the years, if I ever get homesick, and the always say yesfor Ocean Beach. I felt instantly connected from the very first moments that I stood on Newport Ave., in front of the shoe store, looking west toward the beachand the bikinisand my home. So Ill close this by saying that with all that life hands us, good and bad, we all have at least one memory that makes us smile every time. For me, thats the time that I experienced O.B. As your Governor once saidIll be back.ReplyFrank GormlieMay 24, 2010 at 7:53 pmWayne, thanks so  much for visiting us, and please come back soon and often. Know most of the references that you mentioned. Some like Spaceman and Square pan Pizza are gone, some have been altered like the Arizona, and some are just still there, like the Black and the Sunshine Co.ReplyChuck MarlowMay 26, 2010 at 5:25 pmI grew up in OB.  My folks owned the Newport Pastry Shoppe across the street from the Strand.  Previously, they had the bakery at the corner of Newport and Bacon.  I remember the beach before the pier was built.  Destroyed a great left ride.  Do miss the beach as now I live in Sioux Falls, SD.ReplyFrank GormlieMay 26, 2010 at 7:45 pmChuck, welcome back, in a way. I definitely remember that great left before the pier was built. But I dont remember your folks bakery across from the Strand. I do remember one up a block east. At any rate, come back for a visit soon and often. Check out our scanned old original OB Rags and some of the history that surrounded its publication.peace.ReplyChuck MarlowMay 26, 2010 at 8:07 pmFrank:     If I remember right, the folks closed down the bakery in 1965.  Stiff competition from the bakery/coffee shop up the street and Safeway.  Remember Ma and Pa Zekes?  The folks sold the older bakery to them.  Must have been in the early 50s.  Its good to read about OB.  Hey, I even still have an OB sticker on my pickup driving around Sioux FallsSaw an OB sticker on a vehicle in the Black Hills last summerStill keep in touch with Doug Tillinghast.ChuckReplyFrank GormlieMay 26, 2010 at 8:34 pmSure, Chuck, Zekes is definitely in my teenage memory bank. A weird place but they sold great chicken out that side window on Bacon. The two young kids working for them turned out to be full-fledged KKK members complete with sheet, and they pranced around Newport a couple of times in full regalia. I dont remember your folks bakery but I can see why they had heavy competition from up the street, as that is the bakery I remember  wonderful fruit pastry squares! (No, Im not hungry, just on a dessert fast for 8 weeks.)The OB sticker does get around. A friend by the name of Michael Steinberg once lived in OB, had moved back east to the Carolinas, and was traveling back to Cali by Grayhound, and as the bus was pulling into the Bay Area in the early morning hours, the first car he sees on the bridge was a VW with an OB sticker.ReplyTEKAugust 29, 2010 at 1:43 pmChuck,Didnt you take drama at Mesa from Art and Woody?Art Noll passed away last year, and a bunch of people turned up,John Peters, Scott Beverly, Milt Woodruff, of course, lots ofthe old cast.Tom Kopache is one of the few actors to be a Star Trekregularbought an old Plymouth from him for $25,such a deal.  Last I heard, Barry Messer was a leader inthe Masons.I spent every spare evening in 1968-70 at the InBetween. Got to know Ann Dosher and some of the OB leading lights.  It wasalways fun when someone would stagger in and collapse, andwed load them into the 55 Chevy and cart them to the ERto get jumper cabled.  The Black moved to the InBetweensoriginal site.  I still cant imagine being an undergrad withouta place like thathow can people grow souls?  (Or barnacles,anyway?)The administration of the grants which kept the InBetween runningwould fill a book in itselfall the qualified social scientists were absent,doing research in some other country, and they hired some characterwith no qualifications at all.  Then there was a coup detat where someoutside characters tried to take over the board.  Dennis Ewald got acopy of the bylaws and stopped them cold.  (Id have like to see DEunder Roberts Rules(!)I remember The Lost Coin where the Campus Crusade for Christset up across the street and toward the ocean from the InBetween.Bunch of satanists showed up (IN CAPES!) and a weird time washad by all.There was always access to coffee in OB.  Truly, a civilized place.And Zekes Chicken Liver and Mayo sandwiches.Sigh.ReplyBoweenie BlossomAugust 24, 2010 at 7:13 pmOnly those of us who were lucky enough to be born and raised in OB know the true spirit of our community. Im the oldest daughter of Terry Boweenie Bowman. The Lockwoods are family to us and on my maternal side Im proud to be the cousin of David Velasquez (red house) anyone remember him? I miss the smell of Zekes, he lived across the street from me on Coronado, (his house smelled just like his resturant) and there was not a single thing you needed that Cornets did not have.  I love my town and have seen it go through so many changes, we must not give up on our town and what the hell is that line at hodads all about, and what is more hypocritical than all those new cars in OB peoples food store parking lot. Get with the OB spirit and put those homeless bums to work there for their food..REMEMBER the real OBPeoples if you wanted to buy you had to contribute.  Another thing  I find so absurd its hilairous is the OB Community Service facade where the Inbetween used to be.ReplydomaseriskAugust 29, 2010 at 11:34 pmwho was shaking his head back and forth knowingly Grissom shifted his eyes over at Brass,ReplyKathryn RogersOctober 19, 2010 at 12:02 pmI lived in Pt. Loma/OB from 1958 til 1970 something.  It sure is fun hearing of all the stories peeps have of the old home place.Like to clear up a few things and add a bit of history to the archives.My parents owned Homers Variety store prior to Cornets.  It was a true 5 & dime and its sign reflected that.  Cornets about put us out of business and was one of the first chain stores in Ob.The Methodist church had a really great lay youth teacher who came up with the idea of The Inbetween.  If you were looking towards the beach, it was on the right hand side of Newport and was called The Inbetween because it was in between 2 bars.  I helped open the place and was in on the painting of the map right inside the door.Across the street was The Paisley Pelican,  the 1st head shop prior to The Black.  I remember collecting banana peels, ala Mellow Yellow, there and used to sew clothing for sale in the shop.I still have pictures of the OB drum company and of Mike Stewart of the OB School House.  I used to live in the school house with Mad Madeline, Mikes mother and Mike who had the attic all to himself.We had a huge candy section in Homers  and we would fill up a sack and check out movies at The Strand.  We were a rowdy bunch and would take cap guns to the Westerns being shown and follow right along with the movie.  I remember being at the Strand one night and there was a war protest with peeps setting trash cans on fire in the middle of the street and then marching down one isle and up the other with war posters and chanting No more war!.There was an OB 9 (or 11, cant remember all that much! that went to jail for printing a How to Make a Moltov Cocktail in a local rag  was that you?  and getting a  lot of publicity and trouble from it.I used to hang with the local bikers, The Family, and went by Gypsy aka Kay.  It would be fun to see if anyone remembers me.Lots of fun in OB and I was right there in the heyday.  Wouldnt have traded those times for the world!ReplyKathryn RogersOctober 19, 2010 at 12:09 pmTo add to my very long post aboveI really have had a good laugh at some of the things that are being complained about now and fer sher were complained about back in the late 60s and early 70s.  The Wall at the bottom of Newport was torn down because of complaints that the hippies used to congregate there.  They tore it down then and now there are complaints because of the very same issues now?  Ahem.  some people never learn.Also, there were a lot of complaints in the 60s about panhandlers (and I of course had been guilty of that myself).  2010 redux!  LMAOSame as it ever was.ReplyFrank GormlieOctober 19, 2010 at 12:12 pmKathryn  welcome back! Youve added some great history. Go check out our recent posts on the Strand Theater.
