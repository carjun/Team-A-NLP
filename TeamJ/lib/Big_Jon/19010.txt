I danced the night away and sobered up by the end of the party. There were Deputies in the parking lot of the club we went to that were taking peoples keys and putting them in Cabs if they appeared loaded. Now that is what I call public service. Beats a ride to jail any day!Happy New Year ! 8 days agoflag  reply+1Vierotchka  Sparky2U:In Switzerland, we have long had an organization called Nez Rouges (red noses) which one can call during Christmas and the New year if you have had too much to drink. They send two sober people to you - one to drive you home in your car, the other following you to take the driver back to headquarters after you've been safely delivered to your home and your car parked nearby. It is an entirely free service, all the people working in it are volunteers. The concept works so well that other countries are now looking into creating the same kind of organizations. 8 days agoflag  reply+7Mikey_PogoloffWooohooooo!  just a little longer till the end of the world in 2012!  or the biggest letdown since Y2K at least in terms of entertainment value...Drunken "i love you man"s here I come! 9 days agoflag  reply+8nanacI wish everyone (friends/foes), on Current a very happy, prosperous, healthy,peaceful, and loving New Year! 9 days agoflag  reply+7CarlosIsDownMy New Years resolution is to spend less time in front of a screen; computer, phone or otherwise...Not counting if I get a data entry job or something in front of a screen... 9 days agoflag  reply+3EthicalVegan  CarlosIsDown:Hah! 9 days agoflag  reply+7CarlosIsDownI'm going to the most exclusive party mathematically possible! 9 days agoflag  reply+4vixxxen618  CarlosIsDown:Is it a party of 1? 9 days agoflag  reply+4Itsbatman_Durr  vixxxen618:happy new year to you!! great thread!! 9 days agoflag  reply+2vixxxen618  Itsbatman_Durr:And to you my new friend! 9 days agoflag  reply+3CarlosIsDown  vixxxen618:Aw yeah! 9 days agoflag  reply+10StoneyroadHappy New Year everyone.My new year's resolution is to spend less time on current.And like most resolutions, it will only last a few days.See you all very soon. 9 days agoflag  reply+8CarlosIsDown  Stoneyroad:Oh, hey, that's a good resolution. 9 days agoflag  reply+9KSirysThank you for the link Vixxxen! hope you, your family and friends have a great Happy New Year! and to everyone on current,Hope you, your family and friends have a great Happy New Year!

I was born in New Jersey, so think of Midnight THERE as "my" real new year's eve time.We're going to have freezing weather here tonight, which is really odd, considering this is Los Angeles.  But i guess it's good for all the flowers on the Rose Bowl Parade floats, because they're all in line, now, outside, ready for tomorrow's festivities in Pasadena.There's snow on the tops of the nearby mountains, which is a lovely bonus.Even when I don't privately write to you, you're very often in my thoughts and in my heart.

A friend's a professor at one of the universities there -- back then, Danny was a bass player for Buzzy Linhart (friends with Todd), then Blood, Sweat & Tears.  Danny ALSO was at Woodstock!Back to the Merry Pranksters... an old acquaintance of mine died a few months back, and he traveled with them.  He's mentioned in the books.  Paul Sawyer.  When he was helping to physically build the Onion (a non-religious Unitarian sanctuary), he and they used to trip there.  Paul became one of the most crazy, insane, funny, and remarkable ministers ever to "serve" at that fellowship.Figured you as such... what did you play?  Still shedding?Hey!
