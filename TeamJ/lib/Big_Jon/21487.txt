Both depend on electrons, the tiny charged particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom.Static Electricity has been known about since earliest times, though it was not properly understood until the discovery of subatomic particles a little over a hundred years ago.Static Electricity on a large scale causes lightning and on a much smaller scale can give you an annoying shock when you step out of a car. You can generate it simply by combing your hair with a nylon comb. The electrical charge transferred to the comb will cause it to attract the hair, or, if you like, to pick up little scraps of paper to entertain the kids.Though interesting, static electricity is of limited practical use. For the remainder of this hub, we'll concentrate on current electricity which is a flow of electrons through a conductor (usually a copper cable). Michael Faraday Faraday, the Father of ElectricityThe Modern Alternator  Faraday's electrical machines were laboratory experiments. Technology has developed his ideas dramatically. The modern alternator does not use permanent magnets but an energised coil instead, to produce the magnetic field. Also, his invention has been turned inside out, with the field coils mounted on the armature (now called the rotor) and the electrical current induced on the stationary coils (the stator). There are normally three stationary windings in the stator, spaced 120 apart, to produce 3-phase alternating current, the modern standard for distribution. A Little ScienceBut first, we need to talk a bit about Energy. In Physics, Energy is defined as the ability to do Work. (Everyday examples of Work are: climbing stairs, loading a truck. anything that involves moving mass). Some of the common types of energy are: heat, light, kinetic energy (movement), chemical energy, gravitational energy and of course. electrical energy.In Physics, the Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transformed from one type to another. This means that to generate electricity, we have to use another kind of energy to fuel the process - in this World you don't get something for nothing!Michael FaradayIn the 19th Century, Michael Faraday carried out the pioneering work that linked Electricity and Magnetism. In particular, he showed that an electrical current is generated in a conductor moving in a magnetic field.The effect is greatly magnified if the conductor is replaced with a coil or coils of copper wire. If these coils are mounted on a rotating shaft or armature, continuous rotation will produce a continuous alternating electrical current. This is how nearly all electricity is generated today.Now that we have a device (the generator, or alternator) that converts mechanical energy (rotation) into electrical energy, the next problem is how to obtain the mechanical energy to keep the alternator spinning. Here is a brief summary of some of the viable ways of generating electricity on a commercial scale. The Commercial OptionsFossil FuelsIn a coal or oil fired power station, the fuel is burned (converting its chemical energy into heat) and the heat used to convert water into steam at very high temperature and pressure. This then drives a steam turbine, a device which harnesses the energy in the steam (heat and pressure) to produce rotational movement (mechanical energy). The rotating shaft of the steam turbine is coupled to the armature of the alternator, so the final result is electricity.Wind PowerWindmills have been around for centuries and all have harnessed the energy of moving air (wind!) through rotating sails or fan blades. Traditionally, the mechanical energy was used directly, to turn a mill wheel. A modern wind turbine simply couples the rotating shaft to an alternator armature. The last link in the chain is always the same - electricity from mechanical rotation.Hydro Electric PowerHere, the source energy (there always has to be one!) is gravitational potential energy. A mountain stream is dammed in a high place, to create an artificial lake or reservoir. Farther down the mountain, the power station is equipped with water turbines. These are simply highly efficient versions of the old fashioned water-wheel; effectively they harness the kinetic energy of a carefully channelled waterfall to produce mechanical rotation. The rest you know.Tidal Power and Wave PowerThese new technologies extract energy from the long-term bulk movement of water in a tidal estuary and from the short-term wave motion of the surface. The principle remains the same, to harness the 'free' natural energy in moving water to drive a mechanical turbine.Solar Power - localIn a sense. all energy on Earth is solar energy, as even fossil fuels are chemical 'memories' of ancient sunshine. But we're talking here about generating electricity from solar energy, and strangely enough, it's not very easy. The problem is that you can't easily convert sunshine into mechanical rotation to drive alternators on a commercial scale. Solar panels have no moving parts, and so the electricity they produce is 'DC' or direct current. This is like the electricity from a battery. It's great for local use, e.g. running a small irrigation pump, but the big problem with DC is that it is hard to distribute. (No time to explain that now - maybe another hub!)Solar Power - commercialPhotovoltaic units, as described above, are best suited to localised applications like space or water heating. However, commercial-scale solar power plants, though still expensive to build, are becoming viable, the more so as the price of fossil fuels increases.No single design for commercial solar power has yet won through, but all are based on the same idea - a large array of reflectors to collect the sun's rays and focus them onto a receiver which is effectively pipe-work containing a heat-absorbing fluid. Technologies are already well developed to store the collected energy as heat and to convert it to electricity using steam or gas turbines at a steady rate, night and day. The biggest problem is that the sun moves (OK, the Earth rotates!) and so ingenious tracking mechanisms are needed to make the reflectors follow the sun through the daylight hours.Ironically, the part of the world best suited for deploying this technology is the part that least needs it - the oil rich deserts of the Middle East.Geothermal EnergyThis is another underdeveloped source. If you drill down into the Earth's crust, at first the temperature drops, because the sun's warmth can't penetrate. But deeper, the temperature rises. Volcanoes are evidence of this - molten lava is pretty hot! That well of energy is there to be tapped. As always, the final conversion process is the familiar steam turbine. And, like solar energy, it is environmentally friendly, provided you don't accidentally trigger a local volcano! But it is not as simple as it seems. The process of taking heat from a hot rock cools the rock locally. There's plenty more heat surrounding it, but can it flow quickly enough to your collectors? Again, it's another technology whose time will come, but not a panacaea.Nuclear EnergyThis is the controversial one. Nuclear fission is a process in which unstable (radioactive) atomic nuclei break down, releasing energy in the form of radiation (escaping particles). By concentrating these nuclei together, a controlled chain recation is produced releasing huge amounts of energy which is used to convert water into steam. The process of generating electricity in a nuclear power plant is simply by steam turbine, exactly the same as in a fossil fuel plant. The public fear of nuclear power is twofold: the risk of meltdown - an uncontrolled nuclear reactor is not very different from an 'atomic' bomb; also the by-product, radioactive nuclear waste, is none too pleasant.As an aside - Nuclear energy does not obey the classical Physics law of conservation of Energy. It does however obey the Modern Physics law of conservation of Mass-Energy which allows for interconversion of matter and energy according to Einstein's famous equation E=mc  This fundamental difference means that Nuclear Energy is potentially the most fruitful source of all. It is important that proper scientific research & development into nuclear energy, and Nuclear Fusion in particular, should be allowed to continue.

It was a fun one to write too.vic3 years ago Thank you for a very informative hub.Paraglider3 years ago My pleasure - thanks for commenting!OneShot3 years ago Very informative -- Many thanks.  I believe, however, that a solar plant in a predominantly sunny area could serve the same function as a nuclear plant as long as adequate energy storage for non-daylight hours was available.  I am talking about a heat collecting system rather than a primary electrical conversion.you also might want to check out this url (one of many on the subject).http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/01If this invention pans out  solar technology has just taken a huge leap forward.Paraglider3 years ago OneShot - yes. Heat collection systems e.g. those based on an array of large ground-based reflectors focusing solar rays onto a large conversion plant high on a tower block, are very interesting, and far more practical than local photovoltaic panels. They are weather dependent though, and not viable everywhere. Thanks for the link.Rmnathan3 years ago Very good hub, Paraglider. You have given much information within this short space. People are talking about solar energy for a long time now, but still it is not used to it full potential. I wonder even in countries like UAE where I live now, and sun light is available eccessively, it is not used properly. At least now the newly introduced parking meters are powered by solar cells.Paraglider3 years ago Thanks Rmnathan, and welcome back - haven't 'seen' you for a few weeks. Large scale solar conversion is still expensive, but it's got to come. And you're right - there's no shortage of sunshine in Sharjah!dc643 years ago What a great hub. I like learning things and I'm glad I found your hubpage. I wish I could find more like this. Well, back to the search!Paraglider3 years ago Thanks for telling me, dc64. It's always nice to be appreciated! Good hunting :)dedsetdad3 years ago do you have any thoughts on tesla?Paraglider3 years ago Tesla was brilliant of course and a great inventor. He moved things forward in so many areas. But he was a good hundred years later than Faraday. Tesla helped to kick-start the modern age (i.e. 20th Century). I suppose Faraday was more of a scientist and Tesla more of a technologist.SJK VDO2 years ago Thanks for this Excellent article. I recently started selling the Forever Flashlight which uses The Faraday Principle of Electromagnetic Energy and I was wondering who Faraday was and how the Forever Flashlight worked. I came upon your Hub yesterday and found this article explaining it. I have made a link to this Hub from my webpage: http://volumediscountsonline.biz/HomeCarBoat.php Please review this and approve of my link. Thanks again, SteveParaglider2 years ago Thanks Steve - an earlier version of the flashlight used a tungsten bulb and a sort of hand crank to spin a miniature alternator to keep it lit. But because tungsten lighting is so inefficient, you had to keep pumping to keep the light shining. So not very practical (but good exercise!) The LED version makes sense.Steve2 years ago I sell solar products also. I am interested in the Solar 12v battery charger. I would like to hook it up to my Water Pump and pump water out of the creek instead of usng County water (save on my water bill plus we have an extreme water drought here; we could run out of water). Could I use the solar panel to charge a car battery and at the same time hook the battery up to the electrical plug on my water pump and run it that way?Paraglider2 years ago In principle, yes, but only if the water pump is a 12 volt model. Also, the charger is likely to deliver less charging current than the water pump consumes under load. So you could not use the pump continuously. Just as an example - if the charger delivers 0.5 Amps and the pump draws 2 Amps (both at 12 Volts), then you would need four hours of charging for every one hour of pumping.Having just looked at your page - the bigger of the two chargers is only 5 Watts (which is just over 0.4 Amps at 12 Volts). Check the rating of your water pump. If it's 25 Watts your looking at 5 hours charging for 1 hour pumping.compu-smart2 years ago Great energetic informative hub;)Paraglider2 years ago Thanks C-S :)Mike Mathiesen2 years ago Energy is defined as the ability to do work.  So, the Creator of the Universe, in making all of this energy that we see since the Big Bang was really about doing work.  Since everything in the universe is energy, then the entire meaning of the universe is the limitless ability to do work.  We humans have such a poor power of understanding.  It's fun to revisit these simpler days in the scientific thought process.  Albert Einstein said.  "Religion without Science is short-sighted.  But, Science without Religion is blind."Paraglider2 years ago Mike - thanks for commenting. You'll forgive me if I don't comment on your views on Creation. I don't feel qualified to make a definitive statement!Newton's Rival2 years ago I absolutely love you hub. I am an electricity,magnetism freak.

That's an oversimplification, but OK for starters. Electric Current is a flow of electrons, usually in copper wire, but many other conductors exist.ur dad2 years ago this web help me alot for my electronics researchCecilleChase052 years ago Very informative hub! I've always been facinated with electrical tools and equipment, my dad being an electrical engineer. My mom wants me to be a nurse though so here I am taking up nursing. You might find this site about getting an electrician course interesting: http://www.electricianweb.com/electrician-course.h As an electrician, you get to work closely with electricity. I would have pursued this course or that of my dad's if things had gone differently. Cheers!johnr542 years ago They had an interview on Science Friday on NPR a few weeks ago about commerical scale solar power plants that were being built in the desert that, as you point out above, convert the solar to hear and power something like normal turbines.  I found it quite encouraging since it seems like a way to harness solar that is not totally out of the mainstream, and could be cost competitive in the not too distant future.Paraglider2 years ago Cecile - good luck with the nursing!John - Yes, these large scale conversion plants are springing up especially in desert areas. It's a good technology. melody2 years ago need more info on solar cells, its for my project...assignment thingy!!lauren2 years ago whats a hub??i have nooo idea what it means?can any one here tell me?123phata2 years ago '. echo "HI" .'Paraglider2 years ago melody - you have to do your own research, or ask a specific question.

However, I must take issue regarding nuclear energy.  Barring a discovery verging on the miraculous nuclear energy will never be worth the risks in both production and waste disposal.  The astronomical costs are also prohibitive.  Beyond that its simply not necessary.  Solar, wind and maybe a little geothermal are all that we need.  Here is a new development that you should find of particular interest.http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/oxygen-0731.htmParaglider2 years ago CWB - thanks. Nuclear technology should have been more advanced by now than it is, but it has had a (deservedly) bad press which has militated against research. Solar collection in the most suitable places coupled with the new technologies for long distance DC distribution is also looking very strong.vietnamese translator2 years ago Interesting read!esocial2 years ago Very timely topic, as Ohio is without electricity for a week, thanks to the idiots at AEP Ohio.

I'd love to see a more determined effort to use solar and wind powered energy in the UK, but I do understand that the density of our population, and our frequently indifferent weather probably makes this just an idealists fantasy.Paraglider2 years ago Hi Amanda - yes, in UK it's the densely populated SE that uses most of the energy. Scotland has a better balance with hydroelectric power contributing. But nowadays it's not so easy to get agreement to dam a river to create artificial lakes. Lots of environmental issues raise their heads.  SweetiePie2 years ago Very interesting Paraglider and well done.  More specifically, have you ever wrote a hub about solar power generation in the Middle East as I think that would be very interesting.Paraglider2 years ago Hi SweetiePie - thanks for the idea.

Any inputs?Paraglider2 years ago paragliders are polymaths ;)quicksand2 years ago Shocking indeed! I mean high voltages are. :)Hi Paraglider, an excellent hub indeed!  It was like a refresher course for me. I was a great admirer of Faraday, Ampere, and the rest. It was nice to see a picture of Michael Faraday after many years. I believe it was Volta who made the first wet cell battery, by sandwitching strips of blotting paper dipped in salt water, between copper and zinc coins.Previously I was not aware of how radioactive substances produced electricity. I was under the impression that when radioactivity was focussed on to a junction where two unlike metals were brought close together, a current was induced.Thanks for enlightening us. :) Paraglider2 years ago Hi Quicksand - you're right. The 'voltaic pile' was a wet cell pile of dissimilar coins. Thanks for the read & comments.thishumility2 years ago I am proposing that "LOVE is an energy" and it is producing life...which is making as alive... another kind of energy which we must recognize and acknowledge.Harinath2 years ago Paraglider..

I know you think we are a bunch of stupid kids but this site really helped. Can you help me? Okay, here is my question. How does electricity generate sound and magnetic forces? PLEASE HELP PARAGLIDER!!!! I need as much as I can!Paraglider23 months ago OK, here's the deal: When you talk or sing into a microphone your sound waves cause the microphone's diaphragm to vibrate. The diaphragm is connected to a coil of wire, so that vibrates too. The coil of wire is very close to a magnet. The magnetic field generates an electric current in the moving coil. The current is the same frequency as your original soundwave.  Now, a loudspeaker is just like a microphone in reverse - you squirt the current into the coil which produces a magnetic field. This field reacts with the permenant magnet, causing the coil to move. The coil is attached to a cardboard or plastic 'cone' so that moves too, causing the air to move, giving you a soundwave you can hear.You can't connect a microphone straight to a loudspeaker because the electrical signal from the mic is very small. That's what amplifiers are for, to take the very small microphone signal and multiply it a few hundred times until it is big enough to drive a loudspeaker.Suggest you google the following terms for some pictures and details: "moving coil microphone", "moving coil loudspeaker", "audio amplifier".  Good luck!Aya Katz23 months ago Paraglider, I am currently looking into options for generating my own electricity. I'm considering both windmills and solar panels.I have a generator that runs on propane, as well as being connected to the local electric coop. I have my own well, with an electrical pump. An older friend (she is 85) suggested that I could start out very simply by allowing the mechanical energy from a single windmill to pump my well water. However, I'm not sure how effective that would be since I want the water pumped as needed, not all the time (or only when there's wind.)Any practical suggestions?swimgirl989923 months ago Thank you soooooo much paraglider. I will tell my friends not to bother you with stupidness anymore. This really helped. Bye! Swimgirl9899Paraglider23 months ago Hi Aya - I don't think a mechanical wind-powered water pump is very practical. I think it would almost certainly have to be customised for your well and besides, maybe you don't want a windmill located at the well. Wind generators are usually best on higher ground away from buildings and they can be noisy. The good thing about solar panels is you can use existing roof surfaces (if the elevation is suitable) There's a hubber called solarshingles with a product of the same name. I've no experience of it but it sounds interesting.  http://hubpages.com/profile/solarshinglesAya Katz23 months ago Paraglider, thanks. I'll take a look at solar shingles.Han Thi23 months ago It  is very nice knowledgs.eneree723 months ago How wouild a steam driven generator be made?? Biomass heating has tremendous potential, but has suddenly dissapeared from all the alternative energy conversations.  Corn ethonal was a very bad idea, I realize.  However, corn burning for heating homes, in my opinion is excellent.  About 14 Homes in Michigan, like mine, could be heated for the entire winter with the same amount of corn to fuel and SUV for one (1) year.  The corn used is NOT corn that is food grade corn.  In fact, if 10% of a person's diet were to be of #2 yellow field corn, they would not be hungry, but would still have a great deal of pain, CONSTIPATION!!  Just a totally different type of corn than the type human's consume!I am interested in generating electricity with the steam from the biomass burner, to be totally energy independent, if possible, and sell back to the Elect.

I want to get into the energy generating business in the near future for large commercial use e.g a Whole state in a country. I would like to know if you have any idea about how much it may cost to start up a large commercial project. It seems that most of the things needed are naturally produced e.g water, sun. All that is needed is to build a dam, and install turbines to send to a grid. Any suggestion helps. Thank youParaglider21 months ago Crown Prince - you'll need a team of civil & electrical engineers to build a dam and install turbines.

I like the idea of a dam at the top of it then channeled into a turbine, but where would i ever get one? any info would be very appreciated. thanks, waterVante Johnson20 months ago Really informative and I like the lesson taugh on electricityaman20 months ago thats good but it's costly .Don't you have some cheaper ideas for generating energy?Moses phan20 months ago my dad is moses and he was pushed down the river nile in a basket aand found later. jesus was betraid by barabusParaglider20 months ago Not Barabbas, my young friend - Judas Iscariot.ga20 months ago bitTokuchi20 months ago Hey,Do you think that Solar energy should be used in places like ethiopia where they have a lot of draught?If not, what type of energy do you think is best suited to help out ethiopia?Paraglider20 months ago Tokuchi - yes. They have a lot of sunshine. Smaller scale solar plants can power local irrigation schemes. Larger plants could provide National distribution. Unfortunately, nothing can generate water! Solar powered desalination plants can help, but not if a country is land-locked. EcoAsh20 months ago That was great! Tons of info, makes it clearer to understand how electricity is porduced.Tokuchi20 months ago Thank you very much!your answer was a great help!irrigation was a great idea =D,Do you have or know any very detailed/extended explanations (e.g. hubs or sites) on solar power or tidal/wave power and how they function?Thanks very much.Tokuchi19 months ago Also, do you know any  mathematical calculations or equations involving solar energy?E.g. variables like Area of the panel, and things like that? in order to calculate the potential energy produced.Paraglider19 months ago Tokuchi - apart from the pretty obvious formula that the energy collected is proportional to Area.cos(angle of incidence), no, but any manufacturer should be able to provide data sheets.kewl_grl3319 months ago Thank you really much for the information. Could you please please tell me what is 'Generate Electricity'??Paraglider19 months ago 'Generate' means 'make', OK?hoppy19 months ago u guys are nerd!!!WornArtifact19 months ago good hub but you forgot to mention hydroelectricityWornArtifact19 months ago my bad you did mention hydroelectricityKim Garcia17 months ago Paraglider!! Great Hub, I enjoyed your post very much as it's very informative.Just curious to your thoughts on the study of the Pyramids and their effects on objects, plants, and even people. Werner Von Siemons, founder of the giant electrical company....conducted a study in the 1920's claiming that the pyramids held great electrical powers. Just curious to your take on this.Thanks for posting, and look forward to reading more!Peace ~ Kmannymoo17 months ago good stuffbarryboo17 months ago thank yu mannymooParaglider17 months ago Kim - I've never come across Siemen's study of the pyramids. My own training (as a physicist) suggests there should be no special 'powers' in pyramids. (Mountains are much bigger, after all, and some, like Fuji or Mt Hood, are very regular). But if there's any real evidence I'd be interested to read it.jonty17 months ago wow .... this is awesome hub .... very nicely explained ... very informative ..... well written ..... keep up the good work ..... god bless u ......Abubakar15 months ago thanks to you for your efforts, I become more educated any time I read your work. by profession I am an Engineer, I am particularly interested on how to generate electricity on a commercial scale. do you think we can partner with you?Paraglider15 months ago Jonty - thanks, and sorry for missing your comment till now.Abubakar - Are you in the Gulf region by any chance? I'm a TV Broadcast Engineer by profession, so I am not really in the generation/distribution field.bakrsmgee15 months ago Am currently in Africa, Nigeria in particular through this hub I believe we can work out something. the trend is: propose a plan on how to generate electricity to the local people on a commercial plan ( cost inclusive) and the government will consider approval.my main concern is there are many ways out there but people here does not have the potential to propose.see if we can connect with a reputable electricity generating company and  we take it up from there.s.francis15 months ago if i connect a volt meter between a copper plate and an alluminium plate i get .5volts, could i get an led that low that it would be lit?.....sfrancis15 months ago sorry got that wrong earlier, try again...if i connect a volt meter between a copper plate and an alluminium plate(and push them both into the earty-dirt) i get .5volts, could i get an led that low that it would be lit?....Paraglider15 months ago bakrsmgee - as I said, Electricity Generation isn't my business. I'm fully occupied in my own line. But good luck in finding a commercial partner if you are trying to fill a need in Africa.s.francis - yes, but the voltage will drop when the LED draws current. You'd need quite big plate areas to keep it lit.bakrsmgee15 months ago thanks .yow15 months ago boang mobladran15 months ago blud,this stuff isvex, i meen im sitting here sucking on somelemon inmy yard init cus it bladranTYRA15 months ago omg this is the coolest site ever !!!! you guys are so cool please all give me your email adress i look forward to your reply !!loovvve tyragladice15 months ago jeeze louise, this bladran dude is chilling my grill mani mean you see the way you write bladranit just so eye openingi love you dude lets totally get hitched ;)blobloo15 months ago hahahha i am here to relieve stress from all the unwanted parts in your body :) inhail deeply ..... and out ....and in ......and out !!!! i am here to answer all your worries !gladice15 months ago blobloo dude i totally get your vibeyou'veso released my stress man thanks babebladran15 months ago damn this stuff is vex blud, i mean yh gladice im totallt getting your vibe babe yh we should get hitched babe this stuff is wack.

Nice post.Paraglider15 months ago Thanks Peterander - these renewable sources are coming into their own more and moredusanotes15 months ago Can we eventually produce enough solar energy for a population of scientists with "refuel" of their moon vehicles and lights and heat for their buildings for 500 people? Or is that solar estimate way low? I'm talking about power from solar power cells on the moon? If the answer is yes and more, how much more? And is there a way to transmit that power from the Moon to the earth in large batteries or something even more creative? Don WhiteParaglider15 months ago Dusanotes - Solar generation on the moon's surface is realistic. With no atmosphere and no weather, it would also be highly predictable. But relaying energy from the moon to the Earth is not so easy, especially as the moon is not in a geostationary orbit. Huge technical problems.thaninja15 months ago The relationship between electricity and magnetism is fascinating to me.  I am one of those people who dream of perpetual motion machines!  I can't help it.Paraglider15 months ago thaninja - never stop dreaming !!Dinesh14 months ago what a wonderful idea article ....keep up the good work ......Paraglider14 months ago Thanks Dinesh :)School girl14 months ago This is silly (:snowman14 months ago Thanks for the hub, very insightfulnaruto14 months ago rock on little doods keep fighting and dont give up just like ma naruto uzumaki see ya and i want to kiss u issabella snowSalvia14 months ago hey dudesGusTheRedneck14 months ago Dave - Not only was this hub a great hub, but it even attracted a bunch of teeny-bopper spammers. That combination is certainly hard to beat. :-)))Paraglider14 months ago Hi Gus, and welcome. A few of these kids were genuinely here for school project research, so a bit of playing on the side was fine by me. I remember these days...prettydarkhorse14 months ago hi , you have many students fans out there, hmmmmm. it is nice to learn about these things, I also read your comment about microphones, now I understand how it works...you make concepts more understandable, I remember when I was 10 years old and my teacher asked me, if you pushed a table and it is too heavy and it didnt move, is there force used? but of course I understand it more now, and apply it to like for example conservation of energy...thanks Dave, have a good day, MaitaParaglider14 months ago Hi Maita - so now you know how it works, don't thump it to check if it's working, ok? That's what kills lots of microphones :)jessie14 months ago wlw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkVizey14 months ago very nformative hub.. got to know manythings about electricity.. keep up the good work..soso13 months ago thank udave12 months ago dis is goodRanjit 12 months ago I would like to know how wind turbine electricity is produced and stored in to battery? What are the equipments (including smallest parts) are needed.e.g. 1) Fan with low speed shaft with gear box. 2) Battery (but how to connect fan with battery, that i would like to know ?)Paraglider12 months ago Ranjit - There is too much technical detail for a comment to cover. You need to start with the load calculation. What is the drain on the battery? That tells you the required output from your turbine. The output will be AC, which has to be rectified and regulated, and so on. The theory is easy enough but the installation needs proper engineering design. Not a five minute job!Barlow Kid12 months ago Hey thanksbarlow kid 212 months ago safeBarlow Kid12 months ago Hey what you doing barlow kid 2OpinionDuck12 months ago Interestingmay12 months ago do you have any suggestions on how to generate power using urine??Paraglider12 months ago May - no, sorry. Not practical. Urine contains very littleavailable energy. Dried dung is a more realistic prospect. it burns quite well.David11 months ago I think that thorium nuclear energy should be mentioned in this article; it produces safer nuclear waste than traditional atomic fuel. If you are asking "If thorium is so safe, why have we not been using it in all of our power plants?" the government needs depleted uranium and other nuclear biproducts in order to keep the nuclear weapons programs operational. Neat science!Paraglider11 months ago Hi David - I agree with that. Thanks for the suggestion. Sadly, nuclear energy is plagued by almost as much non-science as climate change, so that it's all but impossible to have a sensible discussion on it.mohammad 11 months ago really good information Im making a project and this is my answers !islam 10 months ago thx thats gd information im to making a projectsamuel10 months ago good article. makes a good read for a beginner.karthik10 months ago thnx for the good informationtim9 months ago this is very fasinatingsrinivasan.A9 months ago not bad ,u gave valuble info but try to to give more than this its a request......any way ...super job.Paraglider9 months ago Hey, srinivasan - It was free, OK?

The experimentation is healthy of course, but more standardisation would start to bring the price down.Aidden A5 months ago i liked it, but i think u should have done it in, like, modern english.Paraglider5 months ago I'll bear it in, like, mind.maranda5 months ago i don t knowtony5 months ago hi and thanks for all the information u must be very smart but as i said before thanks.Teddy bear 5 months ago Information is here but if your heart is not you will not learn anythingali4 months ago great informationGoo4 months ago This is great information.Could someone have a metal plate connected to a generator, and apply a heat source like build a fire on it or under it and use that heat to produce electricity on a small scale.Paraglider4 months ago Goo - No, that won't work. A generator is turned by a force, e.g. steam pressure. A hot metal plate is just a hot metal plate!Goo4 months ago OK how do you convert that heat into work or(force) to turn the generator while still using a simple heat source?Paraglider4 months ago Boil water in a closed vessel. Create steam pressure to drive a steam turbine.tom3 months ago you could use a stirling enginekbabe3 months ago from Namibia I'd like to know how to produce electrical energy,but by using natural products not brought from shopsanchalpakar3 months ago Interesting, u must have got an A+ on ur projectAsk Bill2 months ago I've always been intrigued by electricity.

Both depend on electrons, the tiny charged particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom.Static Electricity has been known about since earliest times, though it was not properly understood until the discovery of subatomic particles. i pls the world President Obama to help me out because i want to work with energy this is my Email n_norrington@yahoo.comUche6 weeks ago Pls how can get a small steam turbine which does not consume much steam. my email is uchenna_23877198@yahoo.comwriter836 weeks ago Never think of learning about generating electricity and now i just did. Well, sounds cool information paraglider.Paraglider6 weeks ago Most welcome, writer83, and previous commentators too.Paraglider6 weeks ago Tom. several comment ago, suggested using a Stirling engine instead of a steam turbine, and providing the heat with captured sunlight. This is a good idea. A Stirling Engine is a type of heat engine where the heat source is external and the (non-combustible) fluid is never used up as it is completely sealed inside the compression cylinder system. So it requires less attention and maintenance, and no source of fuel or steam. Only captured sun energy.There's a good Wiki description of the principle.mody5 weeks ago not nice hqahahahahaha badboy.m99@hotmail.comjessy5 weeks ago great and interesting info thanks ;)Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites95ParagliderFrom Kyle, Scotland962 Followers121 HubsJoined 3 years agoRead more hubs by ParagliderContact ParagliderFollow ParagliderSubscribe to Paraglider's RSS feedAnswers The QuestionHow to generate electricityasked by hubpages 3 years ago1 answerAnswer this question Ask a QuestionAsk Paraglider a question based on this Hub.Related Questionsadvantages of steam turbine over the electric motorasked by mynor 3 months ago0 answersAnswer this questionI start my own Poultry farm but now i 'm facing Electricity problem so any one suggest me alternativasked by sushant143 10 months ago0 answersAnswer this questionRelated HubsPositives & Negatives Of Solar Energyby tonks21Alternative Energy : Refuelling  The Worldby Sagarika RathSolar Energy Showdown - which solar energy is best for you?by naturebedsSaving Money With Alternative Energy Sources Like Wind...by Has_aWayWithWordsEasy Energy Science Fair Projects That Are Really Goodby ScienceFairLadySave Energy - Use Solar Cookerby Ash5 Technology ForumTopicRepliesFree WP themes hidden code,,,posted by Bill Manning2How to create a pdf file?posted by oxymoron24Cloud Computingposted by bmharwani0Post a new topic1170 more topics Tagstechnology education energy science solar energy electricity Recommendations  HubPagesabout uslearning centerblogaffiliatesadvertise link to this pagecopyrightCopyright  2011 Hubpages Inc. and respective owners.
