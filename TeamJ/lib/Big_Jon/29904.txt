"We know that we gather here without distinction of party; the needs of this institution have always risen above partisanship."Ms Palin, seen as a likely Republican candidate for president in 2012, had been under pressure to respond publicly to the criticisms piled on her since the Tucson shooting, notably linked to a map posted by her political action committee last year that used cross-hair symbols to identify districts with vulnerable Democrat incumbents before last year's midterm elections. One was Ms Gifford's.Her statement may have had a greater impact than she expected because of her citing "blood libel", a phrase associated with the centuries-old slander of Jews that they used the blood of Christian children in their rituals and one used as a pretext for anti-Semitic persecution. Some Jewish leaders objected to her using the phrase. Ms Giffords, still in intensive care, is Jewish.In her video, shot before a stone fireplace and an American flag, Ms Palin rejected the case for drawing a link between the attempted assassination of Representative Giffords and the heated rhetoric of political debate in last year's campaigns. She had listened to commentary on the killings, she said, "at first puzzled, then with concern and now with sadness to the irresponsible statements from people attempting to apportion blame for this terrible event... Within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence that they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible."There are those who claim political rhetoric is to blame for the despicable act of this deranged, apparently apolitical criminal," Ms Palin went on. "And they claim political debate has somehow gotten more heated just recently. But when was it less heated? Back in those 'calm days' when political figures literally settled their differences with duelling pistols?"Violent acts, she went on, should be blamed on the perpetrators only. "They begin and end with the criminals who commit them, not collectively with all the citizens of the state, not with those who listen to talk radio, not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle, not with law-abiding citizens who respectably exercise their First Amendment rights at campaign rallies."While the fairness of pointing a finger at Ms Palin will be fiercely debated, her standing may already have suffered serious damage, possibly not helped by a statement that seemed more focused on her than on the derad and 14 wounded victims of the assault. "Instead of dialling down the rhetoric at this difficult moment, Sarah Palin chose to accuse others trying to sort out the meaning of this tragedy of somehow engaging in a 'blood libel' against her and others," David Harris, president of the National Jewish Democratic Association said of the governor's video. "This is, of course, a particularly heinous term for American Jews."Mr Obama was expected last night to say nothing in his speech that could be interpreted as partisan. His challenge was to make a speech that will be remembered as uplifting and inspiring at a time of tragedy. The address is inevitably going to be compared to the widely praised words of Bill Clinton in 1995 after the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma that claimed 168 lives, including 19 children under six, and injured more than 680 people.Mr Obama's predecessor, George W Bush, faced a similar challenge in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks, when he stood in the rubble of Neqw York's World Trade Center, speaking through a bullhorn.105                                    kiwismartoneThis woman is deranged...and she wants to a president....can you imagine her instability wth the Nuclear arsenal at her disposal...one wrong world and she'd lose it big time...BBBBBBoOoooommmmm!She is actually 'getting off' on this terrible carnage...can you believe it!!...she and hundreds of USA political appointees are lapping this atrocity up...power to the gun..oh yeahhh!

The simple fact is that people in Africa are beginning to learn Chinese however "one" might better spend "one's" time. http://www.google.de/search?q=teaching+chinese+in+Africa&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-ahttp://english.cri.cn/4406/2009/11/19/1701s530407.htmWildWildEastHer husband may be "Todd" but certainly not Rundgren.

It was hung round their necks in mediaeval Europe with the assertion that Jews killed Christian children to get the blood they were said to require for Passover matzos.I've never heard that libel applied to Buddhists or Catholics.So it really doesn't matter what you accept.  Those are the facts.  And I seriously doubt that any other religious group would want to hijack the term.                                    zandemanWell if he's right, Americans must be stunningly ill-informed.  Most educated British people would understand the meaning of "blood libel".                                    0memiserumAre you mad?                                     0memiserumI certainly watched it before I commented on it.  7:43 minutes of self aggrandisement and vitriol.

(point no. 2)                                    haynemanYour understanding nature does you credit FrankPoster, but you ignore one significant point. Palin is the figurehead of a serious right-wing machine, surrounded by advisors and strategists. Don't be fooled by the 'she's a loose cannon, shooting from the hip' b*llocks - everything she says and does is monitored and analysed by those of her Republican supporters who seek power after the next election. And her well-paid connection with Fox News only emphasises this.But they've seriously misjudged matters this time and will live to regret it, I hope.                                    zandemanPossibly, but she'd hardly make it public if she understood what she was saying, which I have no doubt she didn't.NedSarah was reading off prepared remarks, when she doesn't, what emits is what one Alaskan blogger adeptly described as "word salad".I remember people like Sarah from when I was growing up, I think it's fair to say that there's an element of anti-semitism to her religious belief system. Ned"Just when did "political figures literally settle their differences with duelling pistols?" "Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr and Andrew Jackson did in the early 19th century. Abraham Lincoln was challenged to one, but insisted that it be done with large broadswords, which was a little impractical for the challenger, who was a foot shorter. Of course that was 200 years ago."Also, apparently in her video she was stood in front of a fireplace and an American flag. Does she ever do anything where she isn't in front of an American flag?What did Samuel Johnson say, "patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel"? Meaning that scoundrels pretend to be patriots, not that all patriots are scoundrels.                                    kiwismartoneshe's next for a bullet...voting starts now!                                    badlydrawnbearWhenever I see her videos I am reminded of  a grand Sinclair Lewis quote - "When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.?...                                    FrankPosterI don't think she is being anti-semitic intentionally, she is just plain and simply an insensitive and unintelligent person and does not realise that most of what she does has an impact elsewhere, such a loonies thinking their actions are at least partly legitimised, or offending blacks as she rants on about Obama in a hateful manner, or her choice of words and offending Jews. God help the US and the rest of us if she becomes President, but may be someone will play the crosshairs game with her in return (I am not inciting just speculating that the US has enough loonies to turn this into a another civil war, perhaps)                                    FrankPosterBonk?                                    Ste_HDead right. The Tea Party claims to represent the bulk of American thinking, and yet there are very few countries in recent past that have liberalised as quickly as America has. In the last forty years, America has legalised abortion, has declared all sexuality discrimination unconstitutional, and has rigorously and repeatedly enforced the separation of church and state. Its population has recently voted in vast numbers for a man who is well to the left of American politics. Either the bulk of America is not as right wing as the Tea Party suggests, or they are all blind sheep.The Tea Party is a reaction against all of this. It is the loud and hysterical voice of people who fear that their time is up.The Republicans realise this more than most. They understand that the centre ground of American politics, those people who are absolutely necessary in order to win a presidential election, those people who in the last two years voted overwhelmingly for Obama, have absolutely no chance of voting for Palin. The danger for them is that in a group of already right-wing-ish people (the Republican primary electors) that the Tea Party can have an effect. Then the GOP will be unelectable, no matter what the other side does.john mlOL that one never gets old.                                    badlydrawnbearIn my part of Canada we can receive Fox broadcasts and from time to time I listen in.  After listening to the rantings against the Government it occurred to me that the Tea Party is actually a Neo Fascist organization and is actually starting to implement the Ten Steps towards a Racist State described by Naomi Wolf.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/apr/24/usa.comment1.

Suspend the rule of lawWhen She first identified these ten steps, she was actually talking about the Bush administrations reaction to Sept 11th, but rereading the article, you can see how Fox News and its Tea Party puppets are in the process of ticking off the ten steps.  They certainly have ticked off numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9...                                    yukkejangThis woman is a simpleton living in an increasingly fascist country..                                     01566She meant to say what she said.  The tea party base lapped it up.  Remember the white trailer trash hate Jews as well as blacks.  Also remember ranting about 2nd amendment remedies got Sharon the nomination in Nevada.

(My experience of Africans is that they are very good at learning languages so that should not be a great problem for them. You'll find plenty of information about this online.) But the facts speak for themselves.NimethNimoraActually it's a celebration that Guy Fawkes failed to do so.Also, what does Bonfire Night and election week in the US have to do with this topic?                                    lordlentIt is a pity that America, a great country, is actually allowing a prejudiced clown to address its citizens. Palin talks with words in the same manner that some fanatic preachers in the middle east spew their hatred and venom against others, veiled. I have yet to hear her give a speech where i can actually applaud part of it or find it half reasonable.                                     lordlentHow else will she fool the masses into listening to her ? It is all elemental populism.                                     Flash_harryGood point! The USA Fox media hate jockeys have a lot to answer for. They created the perfect climate for nutters like S P. Obama once again showed his true colourrs in rising above gutter politics of right-wing extremism                                    douglondonShe really is a moron.  Just when did "political figures literally settle their differences with duelling pistols?"  It's pretty clear that American political dialogue is becoming increasingly heated and extreme.Also, apparently in her video she was stood in front of a fireplace and an American flag.  Does she ever do anything where she isn't in front of an American flag?                                    Flash_harryYes, but the really scary thing, even under a card-carrying fruit and nutcase like Sarah, they wil still have the bomb- joining  the 'axis of insanity' with North Korea, Iran, Pakistan etc. The fact they will be heading to economic meltdown is small consolation                                    AsatruIn the US the first week in November is when we come together to elect our leaders. Isn't England the country where they celebrate the attempt to blow up the Parliament at that time?ebbiits always nice to see a clown making stupid speeches . palin should be paid for her entertainment rather than political efforts.                                     2blueA tragedy like this could be used to examine the society we live in and look at how we treat each other. When a 9 year old is shot to death a little introspection may not be a bad thing. Would I want my last words to somebody to be filled with hate and venom. Would I want to take the risk that I had contributed to their death. Perhaps as a "leader" in society I have a duty to moderate my tone, if not my message, so as to lead to a more harmonious discourse and fruitful debate - rather than the confrontational point-scoring that is of politics and playgrounds.MondaysmanchildThe timing is the really sad part. It appears that Palin was trying to take the spotlight away from the President, but the tactic backfired because of a wrong choice of words.                                    koosdelareyObama is president, he had to be measured in his speech. As for Palin, she's right; there isn't one thing, ideologically or otherwise, that connects the murderer to Palin, yet many on the left and some in the so-called mainstream media have all but accused her of being an accomplice. If someone ever takes a pot shot at Palin, once suspects that the left are going to have the war they seem to want so much against the American traditionalists and conservatives. And they'll be wiped out as a result, because i'd put my money on the 180 million or so traditionalists and conservatives over the upper west side elites any day.                                    wikikettleSee what happens when you eat all that meat fed with steroids. I think its bad, ifthis means Palin wont get the Republicannomination. the Right have never acceptedObama as their President and very angry.He keeps reaching out to them and they keep their country in gridd lock. The biggestthreat to America is their inability to passlegislation that will resolve their own problems.                                    John1943The Republicans better have their act together. The majority of Americans want them to get rid of most of what Obama has done. We don't want any more footsy with him. We want a well reasoned opposition. the killer is an atheist idependent. He should fitright in here with the readers here.                                    badlydrawnbearI wonder if this Neo facist tea party shill would be claiming that these killings were non political if it had been Limbaugh or Beck with a bullet in the head...?  Not, of course, that I would ever encourage or endorse such an action as (unlike Beck, Palin and Limbaugh) I do not endorse the taking up of arms against my political opponents...                                    thomasgoodeyWell, let's expunge that Jewish association as quickly as we can by using the phrase repeatedly in other contexts!Actually you are quite mistaken about the American linguistic situation, which is of course the only one that matters to Our Sarah. As many other posters have commented, in recent years the term "blood libel" has been used repeatedly in other connections by all sorts of politicans and demagogues, such as Negro rights leaders and so on. This is a typical case of the flexible English language extending the application of an expression to situations far removed from the one in which it originated. This shows that English is a living and evolving language.In fact Palin is only responding on her own behalf and that of the Tea Party movement against the gross slurs of the liberal American media. This animal is vicious - it defends itself!                                    Trippy2"Violent acts, she went on, should be blamed on the perpetrators only." If that was the case, then why lock up Charles Manson? Did Hitler personally account for the deaths of each Holocaust victim? Or did they each just instruct others to carry out these violent acts? The view that rhetoric has no influence or accountability for the impact it has on other people could only be held by somebody with no sense of responsibilty whatsoever.                                     MikeBoyes"Violent acts, she went on, should be blamed on the perpetrators only. "They begin and end with the criminals who commit them, not collectively with all the citizens of the state, not with those who listen to talk radio..."Can we have copies of this quote laminated and distributed next time social conservatives start griping about violence in films, games, metal music or (insert moral panic of the day here)? Palin and her ilk need to decide either way whether or not they believe exposure to violent/aggressive imagery in everyday life contributes to violence in society, rather than trying to have their cake and eat it like this.                                    Gen777Regardless of the origin of the phrase, it has a Jewish association. At its best, her use of it shows an extreme lack of political senstivity and in that, by itself, Palin has proven to the American people that she is unworthy of office.

Flash_harryIsn't  it reasuring that USA has at last a calm, erudite, rational human being as president. You must be really proud that the obscene Bush legacy is slowly being eroded by someone with with brains to match his charm and compassion. Seeing his considered, well thought out delivery with healing words at a time of great anguish and grief, conrasting with the screeching, vituperative rant of the tea potty from Alaska was a balm to most people. Hopefully this will give him the incentive to tackle America's insane gun laws that allowed an unbalanced kid to buy semi-automatic weapons and slaughter innocents in a shopping mall.                                    milliemicronShe wanted him hunted down 'like Osama bin Laden' - which should make him safe for another decade or so.                                    milliemicronerror deleted!

For a person who already speaks a native language such as Xhosa or the like, and an Indo-European language like English, to learn another Indo-European language as a third language is a task, but not an absolutely Herculean task. But to learn Chinese as a third language, with its challenging tonal structure and writing system, would be a challenge of an altogether different order. [As I am sure you know, attending lessons in Chinese and speaking and writing it fluently are two different animals!] Moreover, if he did, there would be no point unless he became really fluent and accurate, which is not likely: anything short of perfection would just hinder communication and increase the risk of error. Remember that the Chinese who go out to Africa to market their goods are almost certainly pretty good at English already! that's why they get those jobs.Of course it makes sense for an ambitious person to eliminate the Afrikaans and the French, which are essentially useless in the world market; but the time saved is much better spent on perfecting one's English, because that is now de facto the planetary language, and the better one is, the better are one's life opportunities.                                    MoghediaI know this is a little off topic, but I just looked up the definition of Blood Libel and wondered if it could also be applied to the accusations against the 'witches' and 'pagans' of old?    What do others think on this?                                    ericskeltonAs for 'anyone without a brain blaming her'...Well, I might not have.....But she doeth protest too much.                                    Ste_HAn atheist! Well that's good news then. It means that his actions were the result of his personal lack of morality and not derived from the teachings of a religion. I mean, if ever a religious person were to kill someone, that would imply that the religious structure around them was immoral, or at least no better than atheism at making people good. Thank god that has never happened.                                    thomasgoodeyNonsense. English (and indeed other languages) have a well-established system of extending the meanings and applications of phrases far beyond their original scope. It's called "writing". Perhaps "blood libel" was originally used in reference to certain historical allegations about Jewish people in Europe, but now the term is generally used (certainly in America, as pointed out by numerous of your other correspondents) to refer to any gross libel or slander imputing that the libelee or slanderee has blood on his hands in relation to some killing. So Sarah, the great Sarah, used the phrase absolutely appositely. My wider point is that the Jews don't have the right to tell us not to use the phrase in any other context than the obsolete historical one - which is a way of trying further to hammer into us the mantra that "the awfulness of the persecution of the Jewish people is unprecedented throughout history and must never be forgotten". They have tried to hijack the word "holocaust" to exactly the same end. Sorry; I don't accept this crude method of inducing goodthink in my brain.                                    rob_rougeIt's all  a question of economic clout and investment. China is moving into the African economy in a very big way and Africans are beginning to attend lessons in Chinese. I know a number of (black) Africans who can speak fluently three or four languages: at least one local language, English, Afrikaans and German or French. So I see absolutely no reason why, in future, the Chinese should not try to eliminate the third language (be it English or French) in order to facilitate communication and lower the risk of error. (I am saying this as a professional translator.)                                    ericskeltonI'm thinking of posting a list of people who have insulted Islam with snipers rifle cross-hairs superposed upon them. Before I do this I wish to check with all posters that everyone regards this as an entirely innocent act that only someone deranged could possibly misinterperate.NimethNimoraTypical Palin. Less than a week after the shooting and she's already making it about her. News flash Sarah, this isn't about you! It's about the tragedy that 6 people needlessly lost their lives and others are fighting for theirs because some nutcase decided to open fire. Palin should have offered her condolences and left it at that.It would also be nice, if she insists on opening her mouth, if she looked through a dictionary before doing so. The term 'blood libel' (aside from clearly not understanding what it means) is particularly inappropriate given that Giffords is Jewish. I seriously doubt that anyone with half a brain is blaming her for the shooting and she needs to quit making herself out to be the victim.                                    skponggolAfter blaming and smearing Sarah Palin for the Arizona killing, the American lamestream media have succeeded in their long-cherished obssession of mobilising a hit squad to assasinate the Palin family:http://www.facebook.com/pages/I-hate-it-when-I-wake-up-and-Sarah-Palin-is-still-alive/129929197021040?v=wallhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxgJKNpjSNI&feature=player_embedded#!Sarah Palin has spoken so long in the speech, yet the American lamestream media can only pick out the words "blood libel" and then distort it to smear her. There is no better example of "blood libel" than this.As one Chinese proverbs go:????, ????!If you one to frame someone, there is always an excuse to destroy him. By playing with words and images to destroy Sarah Palin and her family, it brings back memory of the Chinese Cultural Revoulution where politcians used words and images to destroy their opponents and their family.                                    haynemanPalin and her poisonous friends can protest as much as they like about being connected to the killings. Even using a term with such a deliberately anti-semitic tone like 'blood libel' to attack the 'liberal Jewish elite' the Right Wing hate so much won't help.From now on and until the next Presidential election, her many shooting and gun-toting references (not to mention the now notorious 'cross-hairs' graphic) will be played over and over again to remind everyone what a dangerous woman she is.Try as hard as she might, she cannot put the extremist, rabble-rousing genie back in the bottle                                    Ste_HShe said that only the killer is ever responsible for the killing, not the rhetoric or the culture surrounding them. Presumably she therefore rejects the arguments that violence in video games causes real violence, that music can influence gang culture, and that Islamic extremist websites encourage people to become terrorists. I assume also that she is happy with Julian Assange, as the information he has leaked cannot possibly have any influence on American security. It's either that or assuming that she is too thick to work through her own arguments to their conclusion.                                    Diomedes1962OK, it was a slur used by the Nazis: (http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/dersturmer.html) although they couldn't claim to have invented it. My point was that the use of this term by this right-wing politician to describe an imagined injustice against herself is inappropriate.Brandt HardinWay to go Sarah by stoking the fire even more with an anti-semitic remark.  Instead of smiling and nodding while talking about murders and national tragedies, try having some humility.  I was compelled to create a visual commentary of her political rhetoric and its effects on my artist's blog at http://dregstudiosart.blogspot.com/2011/01/sarah-palin-made-me-do-it.html.  Drop by and let me know what you think.                                    KalliasI seem to remember being told that an armed society was a polite society. I'm sure on occasion that could be true. What happens if and when that politeness fades?                                     westbritWe shouldn't be offended by this mad person's use of the term 'blood libel'.  Of course, the term is wrong in the context in which Palin uses it, but then again, her grasp of English is, erm, tenuous at best. I do believe though that she might benefit from a good therapist, preferably Jewish.                                     rob_rougeThank you very much for that link. It is very funny, very intelligent and inspiring.                                    thomasgoodeyI don't believe that for a moment. No doubt some of the African people who interact with Chinese businessmen pick up some words and phrases of Chinese, presumably mispronounced because pronouncing Chinese is so hard. But I greatly doubt that they can string together a properly pronounced, meaningful and grammatical sentence in Chinese any more than I can. Let alone write it down. I am sure that real business and technical negotiations between Chinese people and African people are conducted in English, just as such negotiations between Chinese and the locals are conducted in other parts of the world (unless the counterparty is an expatriate Chinese, of course).                                    westbritNo, it's not a Nazi slur. It goes back thousands of years, leading to thousands of years of persecution.NedSycophant.                                     rob_rougeI'm not so sure about the lingua franca. That has been the case for decades now, but Chinese is also being spoken now in parts of Africa for the same reason that English was able to assert itself so easily in the past: business. Who knows, maybe Chinese will be the lingua franca of the next century.                                    OldSocialistI hope the mods leave it alone, huncamunca, as it typifies the warlike (yet curiously childish) rhetoric that's spouted by Palin and the Tea Party and which has seeped into the consciousnesses of some of the  more gullible sectors right wing America. It reminds me of the way the Hitler gang manipulated similarly restricted Germans.Personally I feel sorry for koos de la ray. It must be very uncomfortable to live with so much bile flooding your brain.                                    rob_rougeI accidentally pressed the "liked" button, which certainly does not represent my feelings towards your "Well put, Sarah!" I am always amazed at this phrase "the Jews", as if they really were a race and as if this "collectivity" supposedly thought the same, felt the same, acted the same in response to all issues. I know people of Jewish origin who do not support the Israeli state or otherwise share any particularly "Jewish" values or worship a Jewish god. But then I imagine that it makes life easy to think this way... I feel much the same when I read the "Yes they do" following my little contribution.manisYee haw, good ole Palin, Palin for president, to bring in completel anarchy, to turn America into third world, every citizen has a right to gun but not a right to shoot, lets all support her in her campaign to wipe out the dollar and the banks, and everything American,, She is the chosen oneThose dumb yanks deserve her, Piers Morgan,Simon cowell etc and every other waster we can find and send to that country                                    g0annaheadOn the defensive. Guilt ridden conscience?Sorry, no. This womans made of plastic.                                    huncamuncaTheir are lots of perfectly good combinations of words to use without causing distress to other people.It is not ''hijacking'' its good manners and consideration for others.Shame Sarah Palin doesn't get that aspect either.                                    thomasgoodeyHow does that work exactly? Who voted for that?I suppose you'll tell me that the Jews also have a monopoly over the word "holocaust"? and the homosexuals over the word "gay"?Sorry, I don't accept any of that hijacking. The English language is the common cultural heritage of all right-thinking people, and now is rapidly also becoming  the lingua franca of the entire planet. Its usages are too important for everybody, for them to be diverted for particular issues of partisan propaganda or attitude adjustment.                                    Diomedes1962Isn't the Blood Libel a Nazi slur? Palin barely understands the English language (pundents/proport!?) let alone the wider world around her.                                     huncamuncaSarah PalinNot a politician, clearly. Actually, more a media creation, a reality TV/Internet ''personality''.The best thing we can all do is deny this woman the oxygen of publicity.Either that or insist she dyes herself orange, gets rid of her husband Todd Rundgren and marries Peter Andre at once.                                    zandemanI echo the other criticisms of this stunningly stupid woman, but I don't agree with "anti-Semitic".  I'd say her use of the term "blood libel" is a further reflection of her lifelong lack of intellectual curiosity.  It was clear from her video that she was using a lot of big words that she simply didn't understand.  Like a horse counting, or a chimpanzee painting a picture, Palin was demonstrating the results of training rather than education.                                    conan_drumPalin frequently uses inflamatory language and she is employed by Fox News which is also well known for extreme rhetoric and slurs.  It is impossible to claim total innocence on her part and I am sure she knows it. It was not a Republican he tried to kill it was Democrat, at a rally attended by Democratic  supporters, it is ridiculous to claim there was no political aspect the terrible events.Once again it is all about her.Once afain it is all about her                                    rob_rougeIt evidently upset a large section of the US Jewish community too, according to the article.                                    stonebnWhat a self serving jackass perfect for us politics                                     huncamuncakoos de la rey.Your appalling post is an excellent example of the heinous bile ''American Traditionalists'' do not want spouted in their name.How dare you claim to speak for ''180 million or so''.Nutter.Moderator, please check this out.                                    conan_drumYes they do                                     ABritAbroadPresident Obama was far more measured in his speech at the memorial service; it's a pity that Mrs Palin could not have used the tragedy for more calming words than she did. No-one is blaming her personally for the actions of the gunman, but the rhetoric she - and others - have used does not help to diffuse the bitter feelings on either side of the political divide. She missed a great opportunity to demonstrate any hint of statesmanship she might have. Misled by her advisors and misguided in her speech; voters do not forget.                                    millsmess88"That is reprehensible."No Sarah, you are reprehensible and your actions despicable.                                    pigswillPalin is only saying not to blame her for the shooting. Why does that upset the liberals who pride themselves in being receptive to all sorts of opinions and views.TodayDid anyone actually watch the video hmm of course not. you go after me and accuse me of the murder of someone else and it is a complete lie hell yea I will come back swinging hard                                     refudiatorSigh. Forgive me, but sometimes only the phrase "stupid c*w" will do.                                    thomasgoodeyWell put, Sarah! She certainly has a way with words (or rather, her speechwriters do). And no, the Jews do not have a monopoly over this phrase of the English language.                                    FrogeyeAw, c'mon, Palin is a creation of the LIBERAL media in America, and even atheist Liberal Yanks pray each night that she wins the Republican nomination!  That would be the only way Obama could win in 2012.  Meanwhile, even among Republicans, her poll numbers are dropping like a rock!                                    jeh81I want to hear and see more of Sarah Palin, every day, through every medium of international and national mass communication. She will then torpedo any chance she might have of gaining a position of power. Come on down Sarah...                                     klactoveedsedsteneWhat a despicable woman. The world will be an even worse place if she ever gets to be president.                                    chaoseject"He would admit to seeing the sky as orange and the grass as blue. Normal people don't talk about that stuff."Er, normal people don't need to be told that they don't talk about that stuff. Normal people engage with people they know who say random stuff and pay attention to what's going on. Maybe try to help or understand.Palin is a fool with despicable politics. She needs to tone down her rhetoric if she wants to give the semblance of appearing civilised, no matter how dumb her arguments be.                                    emuchaserme,me,me,me,me,me.michael metcalfeNeqw York ? the derad ?                                    0memiserumIt is not just what Palin said that troubled me.  I was equally concerned about the manner in which she spoke.  She was very combative.  One would have thought that a senior politician making a speech about this incident, in the days immediately following the killings would have wanted to emphasise sorrow for the victims and the bereaved.  She began by doing this but managed about one sentence in this vein before setting off on what is, stripped down to its bare essentials a defence of what one might call a robust debating style.  Heaven alone knows where the reference to a blood libel came from.  I understand why this has given rise to comment but I do not imagine for one moment that Palin has any idea of its previous use or its connotations.  All that this speech does is display to the world that this is a woman without any self knowledge or ability to reflect upon whether she has behaved inappropriately.  She is similarly unable to discern that she was not the sole object of criticism.  She seems to think that anyone suggesting that violent political rhetoric might have played a part in the mindset of the gunman is attacking her personally and not only that but attacking her alone.  I would sum up this speech as 'Me, me, me and a bit more me'.  If this is meant to comfort the relatives of the deceased or foster a less vicious atmosphere in which to conduct politics then I'm a Dutchman.                                      FrogeyeLet's take a fair look at the term "blood libel"?  As a liberal Jewish American political commentator surprisingly pointed out, 'In America, only a Jew--and few, at that--would know the meaning of "blood libel"!  Hmmm.  Perhaps someone better look at her speechwriters, for Palin certainly does not have the smarts to know the phrase!It is also worth remembering that stupid and anger-arousing speech comes from BOTH the right and the left.  Care to guess who said, 'If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun."  Yep, Barack Obama!                                    chaosejectWatch from 2'40"WWW DOT mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-the-rhetoric-of-the-right-is-wouldnt-it-be-fun-to-kill-the-people-we-disagree-with/NedI think that's what you are starting to see, and there's been an increasing amount of Republican pushback.I think Mrs. Palin's insertion of what's going to be seen as anti-semetic rhetoric into this is going to make her a pariah in her own camp, especially as Ms. Giffords is Jewish - and besides, it's totally OTT with the victim/martyr metaphor, how many rich Alaskans have been the victims of pogroms? Nate FitzgeraldIt really is time for this woman to go away. Even the Republican Party must see they need someone with leadership skills, not simply a narcissistic reactionary. NedExcuse me, but 6 people died, and all Sarah Palin can concern herself with is whether she's being blamed for it?                                    chaosejectI heard she wanted Assange "hunted down".
