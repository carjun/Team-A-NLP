I swallow hard.  My ears feel like they havent popped yet, as if Ive just arrived by plane and the descent was much too quick.  The edges of my ears tingle with the prickling of needles.  An army of them march to the top of my skull, where they dissolve beneath my thinning hair.  Wave after wave of needles sweep over my brain, the prickling so intense, it becomes an electrocution.Then the tectonic plates inside my head begin to slide under each other and I wince as a brief jolt is accompanied by a dull thud.  I am having an earthquake in my brain.   Id say its about a 7.2.  This is what happens to me when I see someone bristling at the words socialism, progressivism, or anything that might sound like it is for the greater good of the people.  They bristle with fear and ignorance because they have been manipulated by words and phrases that have no substance.  Words and phrases made up by an elite corps of wealthy people with vested interests.  They and their ad agencies make up slogans.  Show the birth certificate.  Obama is a Fascist.  Take our country back!  What the hell does that really mean?  How far back?  Pre-toilet paper?   Or just pre-Civil Rights?I look carefully for the theories and philosophies the Tea Partiers put forth which are worthy of debate.  And I do mean debate in its purest form, namely, logical debate, in which the arguments derive from an axiom, are free from rhetoric and strategy, and based solely on substantiated facts.   I ask Tea Partiers to describe in detail how their political theory and philosophy would be implemented.  I am only answered with inanities and name-calling.  But the more I drill down on my own to discover the details, the more frightening the Tea Party Platform becomes in its insidiousness.  Its well-honed use of double-speak is downright scary.  Add to the mix the awful reality of, Say it often enough and its true, (at least to many brain dead couch potatoes,) and the rhetoric really begins to smell.I have had little luck finding someone who identifies as a Tea Partier who is willing to talk at length with me and comes with facts in hand.  I wanted to find someone who was knowledgeable and could answer my questions in detail and with civility.  The few I could find would never provide detailed answers and only ranted the party pabulum.  Though I wanted to learn in a very personal manner, I was forced to visit Tea Party and other conservative websites.  This really sent me into a spin.  I have found four different Tea Party platforms, but they are essentially the same.  I researched the demographics of Tea partiers.  They are a homogenous group:  older, white, male, Republican, more affluent than most, and identify as Christian, many born again.  The written documents on these sites were interesting and worthy of study.  But it was the posts and comments on these same sights that were most revealing.  The written documents were created by the elite of the Tea Party.  The posts and comments were submitted by, what I can only presume from their language, to be a mob of undereducated, unthinking, nasty, manipulated followers who take all slogans as truth and all mainstream news as gospel.  And it was what these gospel-thumping Tea Party followers wrote that was most disturbing.According to my tally, the most common verb used was crush, followed by shoot and kill.  The most common nouns used were Socialism and guns.  Nice, huh?Crush the left.  Crush Socialism.  Crush Obamas Fascism!  Shoot (insert liberals name here), Kill (insert democrats name here.)  I didnt realize Tea Partiers used such violent words.  Why?  Dont they know the power of words in this day and age of non-critical thought?   We live in a time when one buzz word, one buzz phrase, can incite those who dont understand the political and economic realities of today to do terrible things.  The elite of the party are only playing a Mad Mens game.  The conservative right has mastered the internet.  Beware!  There are sites that will teach you how to make a sign and what to put on it.  It doesnt matter that you dont understand what the words mean, even though they are hateful, misleading, and threatening.  Do the elite of the Tea Party not understand that such inflammatory talk may actually lead to violent acts perpetrated by their more ignorant followers?  A pumped-up, angry, easily-goaded sap, might actually kill someone?  Nah!  The elite, with the help of their ad agencies, distort the truth, and let their unsuspecting underlings do the dirty work.  I have seen language like this with my own eyes on social networking sites.  I cant get my brain around the hate and violence.  I cant comprehend such language, such thought, coming from a group of people who identify as Christian.  Now get this!  Despite Tea Party platform planks to the contrary, a recent Bloomberg Poll showed 70% of Tea Partiers love the Veterans Administration (socialism), Social Security (socialism), Medicare (socialism), the Interstate Highway System (socialism), and Yellowstone National Park (socialism.)  All of this they like, but they hate Socialism!  I am beginning to fall into a spin again.They have no comeback when I ask them, given their published platforms, how they could NOT be irate over the Supreme Court decision to give corporations the same rights as the individual.  You would think this is one area where we can find common ground!  They merely yell back, Capitalism, good!  Socialism, bad!  And Tea Partiers are supposedly well-educated?  My head spins faster.I came upon 17 different versions of the Bible!  That alone is enough to make the Bible suspect as an authority for anything.  But for the sake of intelligent discourse, I felt obliged to get smart.  I ask those that claim to take the Bible literally to read this passage:Image from the Tea Party Jesus BlogActs4: 32  37 32 Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common. 33 And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. 34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sold 35 and laid it at the apostles feet; and distribution was made to each as any had need. 36 Thus Joseph who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, 37 sold a field which belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet.Isnt it clear what Jesus intention was?  Socialism!  Some might even say Communism!  This is the beautifully simple Economics of Jesus.  This is the basic economic theory Jesus would have his disciples live by.   It is an economic theory which seeks to prevent the ill effects that are produced by capitalism  greed, power, and pride, among them.  If one wished to live an even more perfect life, he or she would be wise to hear these other words from the master. If thou wilt be perfect, go sell that which thou hast, and give to the poor.It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich         man to enter the kingdom of heaven.What does it profit them if they gain the whole world, but lose their souls?For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.The least among all you of is the greatest.Jesus was the essence of humility, the essence of compassion and fairness. But when I point these things out, the response is to go to another Book in the Bible, usually the Old Testament, which says something that supports the idea of economic Darwinism and definitely embraces capitalism.  The passages that they manage to find, but which I can never seem to find, essentially say, Its just youre tough luck if you dont have the skills and resources to make it to the top.  Its the survival of the fittest and thats what Capitalism is all about!  Thats what the Bible preaches.   So its OK for people who dont believe in evolution to use Darwins theories when talking about economics?  How ironic is that?In other words, though weve known it all along, one can find almost anything in the Bible to support a preconceived notion, because the Bible is full of it.  However, every version of the Bible I have read, quotes Jesus.  And if he did say these things, they were really profound.  And no Christian Tea Partier will deny these saying of their Lord Jesus.  So what is the problem?  What is it they do not understand?  I, personally, regard Jesus as a very mystical and enlightened being, along with other avatars throughout the ages.  But for those fundamentalist Tea Partiers who do a lot of Bible-thumping, how are you able to violate the tenets of your Lord?  Uh-oh, my whole head is getting hot! If you dont believe in Socialism, dont.  All I ask is for consistency.  All I ask is that there be no hypocrisy.  Do not call yourself a Christian and support the Tea Party platform at the same time.  Deal?  Its the duplicity which gets me, the total disconnect between being a true Christian, of which there are many good ones, and the Tea Party Platform of  I, Me, Mine and No!  None for you!  The only rationale I can come up to explain why any educated person, in this case usually a white male, would support the Tea Party Platform is: Ive already got mine and thats all I care about, or Ive got mine, and I want some more!  It is the rationale of one who does not care about future generations, but only his very short lifetime.  It is the rationale of one who does not see the connectedness of all beings.  It is the rationale of the greedy.  It is the rationale of those who hunger for power, and think they can attain it by playing on the fears of others.    But guess what?  I can handle it!  If thats what you want, if thats what you need, fine!  Just dont go around with the Bible in one hand, and your portfolio of stocks in the other.  I just cant handle the perfidy any longer.  I would have thought if you believed in heaven or the rapture or any of the ways the afterlife is portrayed, you would be free of all fears, and want to leave the earth having done the most good for the most people.  Isnt that what Jesus would have wanted?  But your actions belie your belief in the teachings of Jesus.  You have become so preposterous I am getting dizzier.A Tea Party blogger edits the video of a speech by Shirley Sherrod and makes her out to be a racist, when in fact she had been the model of compassion and advocacy for a white family and helped save their farm.  Yet this edited video and subsequent blogging of Sherrod as a racist led to the piece being picked up by Fox News.  Soon after, it was picked up by other stations and went viral.  Before anyone even tried to scratch the surface to find the real truth, the Obama Administration fired Sherrod.If it makes the news it must be true?  Even if the mainstream media makes up the news it must be true?  Fortunately, someone bothered to view the whole video, and Ms. Sherrod was more than vindicated.  Her refusal to slip quietly away into the shadows became a beacon to all, a beacon that reveals the slimy tactics of the Tea Party.  The whirlpool calls.  I hear its sucking sounds and see it below me, trying to drag me down into its bowels.I get an email which has been sent by a very left-wing, liberal friend of mine to 50 or so like-minded people.  It is a column of photos depicting the exterior and interior of an incredibly beautiful, modern, building.  Men are playing fussball, or eating on the balcony off their room.  The fitness center is wonderful, the grounds are beautiful.  It is a showcase building with all the amenities one could ask for.  The words that precede the photos ask you to see how many pics it will take before you can guess what the building is.  As you get to the 6th or 7th photo, you realize it is a jail.  Then in a huge colorful font, the punch lines that follow the last photo: Interesting, eh?  Except the email was a hoax!  It was a picture of a facility in Loeben, Austria! http://www.snopes.com/photos/architecture/prison.asp  This is pure sophistry at its finest!  How slick we have all become!  Are we proud of ourselves?I am happy to find a few good sites on the internet that debunk emails and other rumors or distortions which go viral and taken as fact by many without further investigation.  But then I thought how do I know these sites that debunk are not bunk as well?  The moral: Handle with extreme care everything that passes for news.  Drill deep.  Question authority!  Question everything!  Question even this article I am writing!Oh, the whirlpool swirls faster.  Just keep looking ahead, and dont look down.  Just keep moving forward.  The vertigo is severe.  I can only look straight ahead and type and ignore the typos cause if I look down at the keyboard I get dizzy.  I fall into a spin.  I will fall into the black abyss and struggling to swim out, I sink deeper.  If I look up, I fall into the white abyss and its no different, just the yin and the yang.  So I stare straight ahead and say damn to the typos, full speed ahead, its only love that is the truth, only peace that begets peace.  Over and over I say them and I ask you to say them, to think them, to act them with me.  Love is the only truth.  Peace begets peace.  But dont say them so many times that they become perfunctory.  Say them intentionally!  If you can do that, well then, you can never say them enough!  Authors Note: Last week, World Wide Hippies published an excerpt from Hunga Dunga, but I neglected to give credit to my good friend Michael Joyner for being the inspiration for choosing that excerpt.  I would like to thank him now for always being an inspiration to me, as well as a great teacher of life, a catalyst to become a better person, and a great poet.  I dedicate this article to him.  Thanks Michael.

LOVE this article.  And yes, my head has been spinning for too long now  Since President Obama was elected!            kathy permalink             August 4, 2010          youve expressed my frustration most succinctly, thanks!  Ill pass this on            Steven Rodriguez permalink             August 4, 2010          Now hold on just a sec: All I ask is for consistency. All I ask is that there be no hypocrisy. Do not call yourself a Christian and support the Tea Party platform at the same time.Jesus did not force his followers to spread their wealth, instead he embraced a little something called free will. But we do have a centralized government that believes its OK to take away from what everyday normal people (yes that includes tea partiers) had to work hard for. So where is the hypocrisy? Liberals should actually love this since its further proof that we are not an established Christian nation. Heres the bottom line: the money you make and the way you choose to spend it is nobodys business but your own! Jesus understood that, and he also understood that you had a choice whether or not to follow his word. We are currently faced with a situation where we arent given that choice. This is where the tea party comes in, and that is why I support them.Also Phil, please see this video on the issue of Shirley Sherrod that completely displays my views on that incident. Pardon the fact that it is satirical and humorous in nature  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msMyihS9uyYPhil Polizatto permalink             August 5, 2010          Well, Steven, there are too many subjects in your response, each of which could be made into an axiom, a syllogism and argued very logically.  Yes free will does mean that you can choose NOT to  live by the words of Jesus.  And I applaud the reinforcement that we are not a Christian nation.  Lets always keep government and the church entirely separate.We could argue for weeks about one economic/social system v another.  All I am saying is that for THOSE TEA PARTIERS who claim to take the Bible literally and the words of Jesus to heart, there is a disconnect, between what they say they believe in and their behavior.  Very simple, my friend.Now I would stop worrying about anyone except yourself.   Get in touch with your SELF.  Does it recognize the connectedness of all beings?  Do you personally call yourself a Christian?  Do you believe in the words of Jesus?  If you do, and follow them precisely, then we are on the same page.  If you do not, for Christs sake, do not call yourself a Christian.  And if you choose to use your free will to ignore Jesuss pleas regarding peace and love and how holding all things in common supports peace and love, then ignore them.  Thats what free will is all about.  Just make sure your behaviors match your beliefs and values.  In fact you should read a previous article of mine here, called Situational Awareness. This is in no way meant as a chastisement.  Each individual must work on his/herself.  That is where the work is to be done.  On yourself.  If you are a follower of Jesus, then you will want to emulate him.  I choose by an act of free will, to surrender my ego, and thereby experience the connectedness of all beings, from which my politics, economics, and philosophy are natural derivatives.  Until one has surrendered the ego, one does not have a clear grasp of the nature of the universe.  As Jesus said, If thine eye be single, thine whole body shall be filled with light.  It was not a poetic notion.  He meant it literally.  When you have truly opened your third eye you will be filled with light.  All will be clear.I simply ask each person, as an individual, to do a reality check.  If you claim to be a follower of Jesus, then whats with all the anti-Socialism, hate and fear-mongering?BTW to anyone else reading this:  this guy Steven is a really nice guy and brand new friend of mine.  I find myself using him to defend my article, since he found fault with it.  But we approach each other with respect, love and humor and its about time I met someone  with whom I can disagree, without having my head explodelol.   Thanks Steven!Lee Balan permalink             August 5, 2010          Excellent article.  Id love to see this broadcast on network TV because it is so truthful and takes to task the hypocrisy of the Tea Party Movement (as well as any self righteous movement, party, politician, or political pundit).   Today there is so much garbage in the media that you have to wear knee high boots just to slug through the evening news.  Politicians and Corporations  seem to have their own versions of reality based on self interest and personal gain.   Fortunately there are people on this site who will not ingest the media poison.  Thanks to Phil for pointing out what should be obvious to everyone: that we are being fed crap by the Tea Party movement and their holier than thou supporters.            Steven Rodriguez permalink             August 5, 2010          Yes I am a Christian and yes my support for the tea party correlates with my Christian values. And who are you to base judgments on their behavior exclusively through their Tea Party membership? Being a member of the Tea Party really doesnt reveal much about you other than a few simple beliefs:limited power of governmentfiscal responsibilityfree marketsClearly, we can fit a huge selection of personalities into that kind of mold, so if you Phil are trying to make the case that these people cant see the connectedness of all beings, that would truly be a stretch.We want our government to protect us rather than provide for us, did we ever say we were against individuals providing for each other? Of course not, and many of us, including myself, do just that. Do you see how the platform AS IT STANDS proves nothing regarding a tea party members personal contribution his or her collectiveness? So really, you are just assuming hypocrisy.Phil Polizatto permalink             August 6, 2010          This will be my last post re my article and the comments above.  Sometimes, in a discussion, if both parties cede nothing, or leave no opening for compromise, then one should walk away.  I will leave it to others to continue this discussion if they wish.  I have no control over what others may write.  I appreciate all feedback, both in support or disagreement with me.I do try to be open to all opinions and views.   I said nothing about the Tea Party which I did not research in detail.  And I do not dismiss everything Tea Party supporters  say.  For example, I can agree with most of the Congressional reforms as written in Article I, section j, of the Tea Party Platform.  (I have done my homework.  Everyone should.)  But (as one example from many) I do have a problem with Article V, section l, of the Tea Party Platform.  It says,  Healthcare is not a right.  It is a service.  As a compassionate society we will aid those in need.  Only market based solutions will solve the problems.There is a disconnect within the very sentence.  How can a compassionate society NOT see that healthcare is a RIGHT, not a service!  (How cold, how NOT compassionate!)  If you allow someone to be born,  (in fact the Tea Party platform insists on it!) then just the fact that they are a human being ENTITLES them to health care.  If you are going to bring someone into this world, dont you think you are responsible for their health throughout their lives?  (to say nothing about education, etc.)  Or do you think only the wealthy are entitled to it?  And if you think, yes, only the wealthy are entitled to it, fine.  Just dont affiliate yourself with Jesus.Explain how this compassionate society will actualize giving aid to those in need?  I am listening.  Give me the details.  I, for one, do not trust a market economy to solve social problems, of which health is one.  Medicare for all will solve the problem.  And that is a responsibility of the government.  A market economy is consumer capitalism, which means, by definition,  a profit must be made, and profit will motivate the quality of service that will be provided; the service will be determined by whatever maximizes the bottom line.  Friend, whether an internet site is left or right, usually the visitors to the site are already on board, and the articles speak only to the choir.  You have chosen to be one of the brave ones, to join this site, comment, and make yourself vulnerable.  I applaud you for that.  I like being able to  strongly disagree with someone, knowing we will still walk away with love and peace in our hearts for each other, or at least I hope so.  I only feel compelled, one last time, to address your most recent comment.You said, My support for the tea party correlates with my Christian values. And who are you to base judgments on their behavior exclusively through their Tea Party membership?  I say, I am judging them, not on their Tea Party membership, but on how true they are to their self-proclaimed belief in the teachings of Jesus.  This article was directed towards those members of the Tea Party who proclaim to be disciples of Jesus.  Thats all.During these comments which followed, my intent was to forget the Tea Party and focus on the individual.  If anyone has read my article on Situational Awareness, they would understand the connection between Beliefs and Behaviors.I reiterate: Each individual must work on his/herself. That is where the work is to be done. On yourself. If you are a follower of Jesus, then you will want to emulate him.Steven has intimated he does.  Good for Steven.  He will know if he is truly following the dictate of Jesus to hold all things in common.  All will be able to see it though his actions.  I hope he is a shining model for people of all faiths and no faiths.  He seems to me to be more of an independent thinker and may be wise not to affiliate himself with any one group.I doubt that any member or sympathizer of the Tea Party truly understands the connectedness of all beings, because it is an experience, not a slogan!  And if these people had that experience, there would be no Tea Party.    Hypocrisy only exists where there is a disconnect between what a person says he believes and how he behaves.  By their actions you shall know them.   Read Situational Awareness!Peace            Larry Brinkin permalink             August 7, 2010          Great article, Phil my friend.  You are brilliant and compassionate and sensitive all at the same time, as always.  The thing that is so annoying about the Tea Party and its followers, besides the constant hate and vitriol against the President and others, is that their wrath is misplaced.  Government is good (potentially), and should be bigger.  Government is SocialSecurity, Medicare, highways and freeways, storm drains, sidewalks, national parks and state parks and city parks, health and scientific research, military defense, police and fire services, veterans care, child protection services, and so much more.  Im happy to pay taxes for all these things  what a bargain and a convenience.  Instead of railing at government and the hard work provided by government employees for our benefit, how about railing at Big Business and a corrupt system of corporate funding of politicians.  Right now, in the midst of a horrible recession, big corporations are raking in huge profits while vast unemployment continues.  The corporations keep the dough to themselves in the form of huge payouts to CEOs and boards of directors and stockholders while failing to hire employees.  Instead they force a smaller workforce to work extra hard to the point of getting sick, and/or send their jobs to other countries where they can pay people extremely low wages, where workers have no rights, and thus rake in even more profit.  What could be more disgusting than that?  And how unAmerican! And yet the Tea Partiers think that Obama wanting to extend health care is bad, or that compassionate socialism is bad.  How twisted!!  We can only depend on small businesses to get us out of this recession.  Thats where jobs really are.  And so the Democrats in Congress recently sponsored a bill to provide millions in aid for small businesses.  And it was killed by Republicans!  Who of course are bought and paid for by Big Business (as, alas, are most Democrats, though so many more Democrats also have compassion and really want to serve the people).  Although religious debates hold little interest for me, I do agree with you Phil that true followers of Jesus would insist on compassion rather than profit and greed.Phil Polizatto permalink             August 7, 2010          Thank you so much Larry, for your eloquent comments.  You hit the nail on the head. Something I was struggling with, that truly bothers me about the Tea Party, is the MISPLACED wrath you speak of!  As mentioned in the article, when polled, most members of the Tea Party like many of the things Government provides through taxes, etc.:  All the many useful items and services they take for granted, all the things you mentioned and many more.   The Tea Party IS manipulated by buzz words and slogans that have no substance.  They should be railing against big business, as you say.  I notice the stock markets doing pretty well, but none of their gains are being translated into jobs.  If this is not strong evidence to the Tea Partiers that trickle-down economics does not, and never will work, I dont know what is.The best we all can hope for is that people will stop allowing themselves to be manipulated by mainstream news, that they will try to delve deeper into facts instead of blatant lies which pass as truth because they are repeated often enough, and that people will start thinking for themselves, truly thinking not parroting slogans that help them vent an anger which is totally misdirected.Peace to you, brother Larry!
