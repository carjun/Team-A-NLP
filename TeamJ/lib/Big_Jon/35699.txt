Job Anbalagan        2 0     Views: 184      A suspect was in custody after Representative Gabrielle Giffords was wounded and John M. Roll, a federal judge, was killed, near Tuscon. On Saturday morning, Jared Lee Loughner, a 22-year-old man, went on a shooting rampage in Arizona that killed six people and critically injured a US Congresswoman. He used YouTube, MySpace, to articulate his political views. The shooting occurred about 10 a.m. in a small area between an American flag and an Arizona flag. Jared went into the store for coffee, and as he came out the gunman started firing. He had posted on his Myspace page at some point a photograph of a United States history textbook, on top of which he had placed a handgun. He prepared a series of Internet videos filled with rambling statements on topics like mind control and SWAT teams. In one video, titled "America: Your last memory in a terrorist country!," a figure in dark clothing and a smiley-face mask burns an American flag in the desert. Jared Lee Loughner left a series of postings and homemade videos that laid out a fervent, though largely incoherent, set of political views. He was suspended from college and appears to have left a trail of bizarre and anti-government messages on the Internet. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, and at least 17 others were shot when Jared Lee opened fire outside a supermarket where Ms. Giffords was meeting with constituents. Ms. Giffords, alias as Gabby, had been speaking to constituents in a store alcove under a large white banner bearing her name when a man surged forward and began firing. He tried to escape but was tackled by a bystander and taken into custody by the police. The event, called Congress on Your Corner, was outside a Safeway supermarket northwest of Tucson and was the first opportunity for constituents to meet with Ms. Giffords since she was sworn in for a third term on Wednesday. Six of the victims died, among them John M. Roll, the chief judge for the United States District Court for Arizona, and a 9-year-old girl Gabriel Zimmerman, 30, was among those killed. Another girl who died was identified as Christina Green, a third grader. The others killed were Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwin Stoddard, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. Ms. Giffords, 40, who was the target of the attack, was in critical condition Sunday morning at the University Medical Center in Tucson, after she was operated on by a team of neurosurgeons on Saturday. Dr. Peter Rhee, medical director of the hospitals trauma and critical care unit, said Saturday that she had been shot once in the head, through and through, with the bullet going through her brain. President Obama said that a suspect was in custody and that the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was on his way to Arizona to oversee the investigation. The shootings raised questions about potential political motives, and SheriffSheriff Dupnik blamed the toxic political environment in Arizona. There were immediate national reverberations as Democrats denounced the fierce partisan atmosphere in Ms. Giffords district and top Republicans quickly condemned the violence. Mark Kimble, an aide to Ms. Giffords, said the shooting occurred about 10 a.m. in a small area between an American flag and an Arizona flag. He said that he went into the store for coffee, and that as he came out the gunman started firing. Ms. Giffords was part of the Democratic class of 2006 that swept Democrats into the majority in the House. She narrowly won re-election in November, while many fellow Democrats were toppled and the House turned to Republican control.
