I am an atheist - I don't go around shooting people.  Let's try not to stereotype, shall we?  And just because he said he won't trust in god does not automatically make him an atheist.  Trust and believe are two separate definitions.

It is not unusual for young people to be curious and he appears to be showing he reads a diversity of literary material. This does not mean he is mentally sound but to categorize a person by what they say they read isn't the way to go about it.

Unfortunate as this event may be, it is a reflection of a larger systemic issue. When issues are not resolved pertaining to our government, individuals in the society become alienated an act accordingly. Jarred is not sick mentally and everything he did was done rationally (rational implying calculated, not agreeable). If anyone bothered reading "his favorite" books they would notice the themes are about not being brain-washed as he mentioned. There is nothing inherently evil about those books. While I do not condone his actions, I am not shocked by them. And if people do not wake up, they will find themselves shocked furthermore in an unstable world.

That is truly besides the point... Look at what happened, and this is what you have to say. Wow. For being a former teacher you are pretty clueless to what is important and should know when and where criticism is needed, This is not one of those times. This isn't just such Pop culture story from US Weekly, this is a serious incident where lives where lost, and something affected this man and must have pushed him into a severe psychotic mentality. As you can see, he did have an agenda. But you must realize, his killing agenda is no different than a governments killing agenda of people who stand no chance in poor foreign countries. Killing is wrong. But there is a reason behind every bodies actions, and this is what needs to be analyzed. Not his grammar, or tense just because he mentioned that, he doesn't mean it like an English teacher would...Sure, this guys actions are horribly unacceptable. Very unacceptable. If only people would gather in a peaceful manner and actually stand up to these governmental bullies, we could actually save this country from the downward spiral it is in right now.. Anti depressants, and Anti-Anxiety medication prescription rates are off the charts, because we live in such a f$&ked society. Its just a matter of time before they crack under pressure, and do something stupid like this. Whether this is the case or not regarding this Jared guy, it is a serious problem. Your happy if your unaware of the lies and corruption and just pretend like it inst happening and let it happen behind closed doors. Or your depressed to the max' as soon as you wake up and start researching all the recent corruption and lies we have been told our whole lives. We base our who life off of what we've learned and been told, and its really hard when you find out it was all a lie.  I am in no way saying what this guy did was right, it was in fact very wrong, but this is happening more and more, because people are finally starting to come up and say "I am not going to take this s4!t any more! I live in the land of the free! not 1960 Vietnam!" It is really sad, and I feel so horrible for the families and the people who have been affected by this massacre, but eventually people need to take action IN A PEACEFUL MANNER! and take back what is ours.

In fact, I would say there aren't people falling through the cracks of the mental healthcare system, there are people falling through the huge caverns of the system.  And the majority of those affected my mental illness DO NOT RECEIVE SERVICES.  I feel deeply sorrowed by the tragedy of Congressman Gifford.  I also feel that here we have a wonderful woman, a politician loved by her community, has been seriously injured and become a victim, . . . maybe, just maybe this country and the lawmakers, and those that design where the tax dollars will be spent, will open there closed eyes and come together and finally prioritize differently; put mental healthcare as a top priority in order to provide the desperately needed services the mentally disturbed deserve, 10's of 1,000's of Americans that go untreated that live in a very painful world.

Because in one sense you are agreeing w/this guy, and in the next, you are standing on your soap box telling off someone for using their "freedom of speech" right. In one sense you are high and mighty against the government, and in the next, you are lecturing people on how and what they need to be doing. It seems to me, that that does not create the "peace" you are preaching about. You cant play both sides of the fence, and your post comes across somewhat confusing. You cant look down at people and angrily tell them what they should be doing...if you seek peace, then "talk the talk". The whole tone of your post comes across angry. What anyone, if they cherish human life, should be feeling yes, is anger for the loss of human life, and the survivors for having to experience such a horrific event. And even though this young man did a terrible thing, we must feel bad that he is representative of too many young people today that carry around distorted views, and are obviously in need of people to give them the guidance, support and love that we all need in life. This young man is seriously ill; something that triggered it today, but more important is that this type of behavior just doesn't escalate to this extremeness in one day. He has most likely been leaving clues in his behavior for some time, and no one picked up on it, or, they just didn't know what to do, or turned a blind eye. Someone, somewhere, saw or noticed something off in his behavior long ago. It's too bad for him, and it's too bad for everyone involved. My heart goes out to the little girl's family. How awful to have to live through the death of your nine year old child. And remember, Jared has parents too. They are most likely going to come under attack, and certainly attention, for their son's actions. That is still their son, and though mortified, they still love him, I would hope. My prayers go out to everyone involved.

How is it the guy is captured so quickly and all of sudden they have all this past information. This is clearly too simple. This assassination was clearly orchestrated by someone who wanted to take either the judge of the representative or both. And let me just point out once again that this shooter or hired assassin is not of color which never ceases to surprise me. In a state which is clearly full of hate and discrimination that is fanned by people like Fox News casters that this again not the perfect place to pull this off.

In a short post that was removed-why, I wonder-  I said that the tragedy for now seems to have no immediate political implications. This guy Loughner is an example of a very troubled soul falling through the cracks of the mental health system , but having no problem getting a deadly weapon. As to WHY so many young men crack up , I found the answer a long time ago in a book written by the socialist- psychiatrist Erich Fromm, " The Sane Society ". A lot of  very literate but privileged individuals do not want to accept the truth about a SICK capitalist social order. The truth inspires intelligent and passionate  ACTION -but is also an antidote against impotent rage-the kind fictionalized in the Stephen KIng story.... " Rage " . Always very young men these assassin types !

Trust and belief are quite similar.  Most people who have faith in god also trust in god.  The ones that don't are known as deists.  They believe in God but also hate him or at least think God is not serving the good of mankind.  If you look at the body of what this kid read and said, you would not be off base to consider him an atheist.  And of course not all atheists are evil.  But the point I believe people are trying to make is the refutation that violence is the proclivitiy of the right, religious, converaitive, etc.  And I think this instance adds to that point well.

His inference is those Latino's indeed aren't literate.The reason most people can't understand him is because their views of liberal and conservative are too narrow; it's as if a socialist white supremacist has never walked the earth...(I'm speaking of Hitler, the original socialist white supremacist, author of "Mein Kampf").

Just as an autistic child who had a vaccination does not prove that vaccinations cause autism. A shooting by a white male in a district with a 'measurable Latino population' does not mean the shooting had a basis in that fact.

It was an analysis, bringing out a clue from the evidence we have at hand. But then again, you've stated yourself it is a "fact", and since all we've got are clues like this, what else would you base a reasonable explanation on? If these videos are a clue to whats going on in his mind, and his main point IN that video is about grammar, and he made a point to not so subtly infer most in his district are illiterate (do you really think he's talking about the white majority? It'd be naive at  best if you did...), then what exactly do you think caused him to do this?

He is also a hypocrite for criticizing grammar mistakes when he makes his own. But, criticizing speakers of other languages is popular these days.This is a sad story, sadder still because it was preventable.

That's a common trick. The Liberal Democrats Party that was recently defeated in Japan by the Democrats was the conservative group. When the Republican Party was formed back in the 1850s it was for stronger central government; they wanted to hold the Union together.Names are meaningless; Hitler put communists and socialists into concentration camps along with gays, Gypsies, those with mental disabilities as well as Jews. Hitler was not a socialist. He was a fascist and the corporations were glad to use him.

The days are long gone when anyone can pull that crap anymore. You are either a liar or a towering blob of stupidity and ignorance. You are too stupid to realize that all you are doing is regurgitating left wing propaganda. Stalinists sent trotskyites, devout Orthodox Christians and Jews to soviet concentration camps, too. It was Stalin who labeled the fascists as 'right-wing'. That's like saying that Protestants aren't Christians, because the Catholic church once stated that they weren't.By the way up until Kennedy the Democratic party was conservative and supported states rights', free trade, etc.                    Reply302Flag as Offensive                                            ThomasD                                                        on                         Jan  8,  4:37 PM                     said:Update 2: From his YouTube sight is the reading list of someone who is nuts:Are you serious?

I am glad that you have spoken.  I pray that someone will be brought into your life quickly to show you the truth.  Maybe this was your wake up call- to be on this site and others to see who you are or what you do not have.  I will keep this attitude with me tonight and tomorrow. I can show you that Jesus is here with me and you and you and you.  Wake up.  The next breath could be your last.  Thank God for all he has done for you and accept him.

Or they need meds? Unfortunately you are two that are lost souls. Al Volpe, although somewhat radical, does merit some truth...the truth of God. The world is so lost, so vile, so violent, so immoral, what is next? Do you even care? Or do you just walk through life not aware that there is more to life than just the flesh? There is more to life than just Facebook, and Mtv, and Myspace and yadda yadda. People should be caring about the world and the state that it's in. Everyone WILL have to own up to every vile thing they have ever done...NOONE escapes...not even you Leon and Sarah. We either believe, or we dont. That's it, no inbetween. Start CARING about people. Start LOVING people. Start GIVING, and be KIND. GIVE of yourself. Set a good example for someone else. HELP someone through a difficult time. MAKE A DIFFERENCE in this one life you have! DO GOOD, and seek peace. I hope you believe someday.

The corporatist, nationalistic and authoritarian thread is GOP through and through.   If you are limiting yourself to a single dimension, If communists are the left, the Fascists are the right.  The problem is the single dimension which is why the Looneytarians have their 2 axis measurement system.

At every turn Obama is appeasing the most radical anti-american elements of society from  CAIR to the Homosexual Lobby to the Arms Control lobby, etc. Keep in mind that the left is only supporting these forces to destabilize the US. Both National Socialism and International Socialism have their common origins in Marxian critical theory and early revolutionary theory. International Socialists (Communists) maintain the thesis that the victory of Communism is inevitable, whereas National Socialists (Fascists) maintain the thesis that ultimately socialism on an international level is not attainable, and that national socialism is inevitable.The GOP has kept the borders wide open for years and has had no qualms with the considerable amount of technological transfers to potential threats such as China. The GOP also has been the prime catalyst behind globalization. Corporatist?, yes, but so are the Democrats. Nationalist?, NO.

Obviously, the guy is anti-Semetic.  That is, he poses an extreme form of xenophic bigotry towards Jews.  Most Jews are progressives, meaning members of the Democratic party, which has more to do with what happened in this country, especially during the period from 1920 through the 1950s.  First, one must remember what the American industrialists and bankers (e.g., the Dulles clique) did to the Jews by having Hitler appointed chancellor of Germany, then these Americans literally financed, fueled, and facilitated the systematic killing of over 6 million European Jews -- and let's not forget the Brown Shirt demonstrations these Americans sponsored in New York, the city with the heaviest population of Jewish immigrants and their children, many of whom enlisted into the U.S. military to fight against the Third Reich.  The infamous Henry Ford of the Ford Motors was award the Iron Cross.  This is history repeated itself in a most virulent form of hatred.  Most Jews are for health care reform on moral grounds.  In fact, most Jews were disppointed that the outcome was not single payer health care coverage with the option to possess private health care insurance as a secondary coverage -- much like other countries possess in Europe and Israel.

I've never shot anyone nor do I ever intend to unless in self-defense or in the defense of my family and home. I do not condone what this guy did at all, but to say that anyone who has read any of that material is nuts is a little beyond the pale, and says a lot about the person who said it. Furthermore, the number of misspellings I have found in the articles published by the staff of Business Insider makes me wonder. For example, look at Update #3 at the beginning of this article. The word "volunterring" is misspelled. It should be "volunteering". In this day an age of computers where the leading word processors and email programs all have built-in spellers, finding so many misspelled words doesn't say much for this website. It is very seldom that I find misspelled words in news articles on Yahoo Financial, CNBC, MSNBC, CNN Money, Bloomberg, Mike Shedlock's blog, The Telegraph (UK), the BBC, etc... You guys need to win an award for the most misspelled words ever found on a financial news website. Peeved. You can say that I am. Implying that someone's nuts for shooting someone for no good reason is one thing, and one that I can definitely agree with, but saying someone is nuts based on the stuff they have read is ludicrous at best.

Unfortunately, this nutbag is a right wing idiot (we the living, animal farm) who has decided to take things into his own hands.    Our "elected leaders" who lately have enjoyed calling the President a Socialist, who have joked about revolution, who make veiled references to overthrowing the Obama "regime",,, who enjoy the birthing accusations and "he's really a Muslim in disguise" statements - now have blood on their hands.

Practically all of the books are classics of some form or other. Most of them can be classified as adolescent literature. His views, however, are weird: He says the government uses brainwashing techniques. That's true. But what's this about the 'control of grammar'? Next, he doesn't want to pay the debts. Good for him. But then he raves about the gold standard...Let's wait a bit and learn more about this kid.
