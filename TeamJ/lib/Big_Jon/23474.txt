He also says  he is such a devout Christian that he can not bear the idea of gay people having equal rights. So it seems you need to show us where in his Scriptures Christians are given the freedom to use hyperbolic language, spin, to enhance their own image using language that is not entirely true. The fact is that Christians are commanded to use only the most painfully honest and precise language, seeking only utter clarity of meaning. So tell me why those Scriptures do not apply to the Devout One, but must apply to teh gay?  What in that faith gives permission to say that which one does not actually mean?

Where is the news?  How are people surprised?To my mind it would have been a bigger surprise and certainly more worthy of discussion if he had gone elsewhere with this pick.This is playing ball just the way Clinton did, down the center of the fairway.  A very conventional choice from an apparently now quite grown up fellow.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopKoKo      (1000+ posts)Fri Jan-07-11 08:18 AMResponse to Reply #6166.If the object is to just get re-elected...then Daley is a good pick.Some of us thought that a President is there to do the "Work of the People" and not the work of Wall Street and Party Machine insiders along with more "Free Trade...not Fair Trade" agreements.  We didn't elect a Dem President to undermine SS and Medicare, either.  Then there are those two wars bleeding us dry as the MIC grows larger and surveillance of Americans grows stronger with the new Drone purchased for Miami-Dade County.

We haven't seen this and aren't about to, because the left is lazy and lays down after taking the Whitehouse assuming mistakenly that this was enough.   What should have happened in 2010, if the left really wanted to teach a lesson to the "party machine" was massive losses to the parties and individuals that did not get on board and support the change we clearly voted for in 2008.  If it actually took voting for real progressive change to win elections, keep their jobs, and stay in power, we would have all the progressive change we wanted.  2010 only proved that voting for even modestly progressive change is the surest path to losing an election, becoming unemployed, and being out of power.Only people who are in office actually get to do the "work of the people".  Getting re-elected is always the only object of this profession, and reliably re-electing people when they do some or most of what you want is the only way to have influence on them.   Re-election is the only tangible measure of support that matters.  Politics is actually hard work, you don't just get to win a single election and walk away expecting good results.

This is the one thing they have in common, a desire to keep the job.  If you can get them elected, or raise them lots of money to increase their chances of being re-elected, you will be attended to.  If your support is conditional and ineffective, you are done.  It doesn't matter how "right" you may be ideologically.  You can have the best arguments and thought out positions in the world.  The problem is that we use the wrong metric.  We see correct as the most morally justified position.  Politicians are all but universally situational beasts.  Their lives are dominated by the election in a few weeks or the one in two years.  They are raising money for the next campaign from day 1.  It is a profession that is all about winning elections and not angering too many of the wrong folks in between them.How does one become one of the "wrong folks to anger"?  You do it by being in their corner constantly and reliably as a significant source of votes and money.  This kind of relationship is not created by a single election, it is built over a career.  Why was Kennedy a "liberal lion"?  In part because he believed in it, but in easily equal measure because he could count on being re-elected doing it.  If this were not the case, he would have lost doing it, and losing candidates are never "liberal lions".  Serving liberals are not in "safe seats" because they were already liberal and happen to move there.  Neither do they change the District to a more blue shade.  They become liberals because this is what the voters in these areas have supported with consistently dollars and votes.  The politician is the product of the process, not the other way around.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopVinca      (1000+ posts)Fri Jan-07-11 07:49 AMResponse to Original message62.I think Democrats are paying attention since the last Chief of Staffplayed a large part in destroying health "care" reform.

Of course he was an admitted Republican, but in my lifetime Chief of Staff has been convicted of crimes and sent to prison for them. Forgive me for having a memory, but this is a job that is defined in my mind by HR Haldeman.  O'Donnell is making up dream info. There is NO position in the WH that has never before been criticized.
