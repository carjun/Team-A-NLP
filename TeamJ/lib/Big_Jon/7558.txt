Ground and Pound as Rex Ryan coach of the New York Jets would say. Pick up three yards here, 4 yards there and pound those final few inches for a first down. NFL Running Backs For many teams in the NFL the ideal game is where there is 'a ball controlled offense' that allows for a variety of plays on the ground and in the air. But that mix of plays only works if the running game is sound. So for a running game it is obvious you need a great running back. And the best teams in the NFL have great running backs.Running Backs in the Game of FootballThroughout the NFL history, the average offensive running back averages 4.0 YPA. Theaverage NFL team averages 4.0 YPA. Only the occasional big play in a football game separatesthe average players from the prolific football players such as Barry Sanders or,today, such as Chris Johnson or Adrian Peterson.LaDainian Tomlinson #21 New York  Jets LaDainian Tomlinson  Click thumbnail to view full-sizeLaDainian Tomlinson runs for 133 yards and two scores as the New York Jets roll the Buffalo Bills, 38-14. Sunday, October 3rd 2010 Here I Come New York NFL NY Jets - LaDainian Tomlinson #21LaDanian TomlinsonTomlinson signed with the New York Jets on March 14, 2010. He holds the N.F.L. record with 31 touchdowns in a season. Some say that last year after the worst season of his career, he is washed up (he will turn 31 this June). The first nine years of his NFL career he played for the San Diego Chargers, where as a tailback he displayed the ability to break a big run and can be a force in a third down situation with sure hands and impressive route running. As a running back for the Jets, we will see LT play as a  backup to Shonn Greene, suited up in a green and white uniform, he will have the chance to run behind what may be the N.F.L.sbest offensive line. He will be reunited with offensive coordinator BrianSchottenheimer, who was a Chargers assistant for four years whenTomlinson was there. The NY Jets, who embrace a ground and pound philosophy may be just the extra push Gang Green needs to go all the way this season. The Jets give Tomlinson something, too . . . a chance to win a Super Bowl, the only missing piece on his rsum.Nov 7, 2010 UpdateTomlinson joins Payton in exclusive yardage clubThe New York Jets running back joined Walter Payton as the only players in NFL history to gain 13,000 yards rushing and 4,000 yards receiving. Tomlinson, the seventh-leading rusher in league history, reached the milestone with an 8-yard run during the second quarter of Sunday Oct 31, 2010 9-0 loss to the Green Bay Packers.The New York Jets emphasize running the ball first, its a ground and pound game and that's what LaDanian does; he's a good runner. There's a reason why he has a possibility to be one of the best running backs to ever play the game.LaDainian Tomlinson Career Highlights and AwardsCollege awards and honors5 Pro Bowl selection 4 First-team All-Pro selection 2 Second-team All-Pro AP NFL MVP (2006)PFWA NFL MVP (2006)Co-Walter Payton M.O.Y (2006)Best NFL Player ESPY Award (2007)Best Male Athlete ESPY Award (2007)NFL 2000s All-Decade TeamList of NFL recordsLaDainian TomlinsonStatsDate of birth: June 23, 1979 Place of birth: Rosebud, TexasHeight: 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m)Weight: 221 lb (100 kg)College: Texas ChristianNFL Draft: 2001 / Round: 1 / Pick: 5Debuted: 2001 for the San Diego ChargersCareer HistorySan Diego Chargers(20012009)New York Jets (2010present)Roster status: ActiveDestiny Ladanian Tomilson NikeLadanian TomilsonCareer NFL Statistics as of 2009Rushing yards 12,490Rushing average 4.3Rushing TDs 138Receptions 530Receiving yards 3,955Receiving TDs 15Stats at NFL.comSteven Jackson #39 St. Louis Rams SJ39 St. Louis Rams Running Back Steven Jackson (photo- stlouisrams.com)Steven Jackson Video HighlightsSteven Jackson"Imagine the blinding speed of Tony Dorsett, the bone-crushing power ofEarl Campbell, the ankle-breaking vision and jukes of Barry Sanders,and the backfield pass-catching of Marshall Faulk -- all in onemuscle-packed 6'2", 235-pound frame -- and you begin to get a pictureof the St. Louis Rams' running back No. 39."

And it is because he is the running back that you want to go to all day long, especially when you are in a 3rdand 4 situation,  when you you desperately need a 1st Down because you want to take the game into your winning column. Give it to Adrian Peterson and that is what he will bring you.  Or watch him in the 1st quarter break free and takeit to the house from 60 yards out. Just think, even witheverything that hes been able to accomplish in 2 seasons, hes neverhad a legitimate starting quarterback to help open up the field. Ifthere was even a threat of a pass, just imagine the statistics hedbe capable of producing. And lets not forget that Adrian Peterson is a very worthy hunk of the gridiron, a sexy butt added to all this great football player has to offer.

With defenses worriedabout stopping the run, this leaves the window wide open for Tony Romoand the Cowboys prolific passing attack.Perhaps the only knock in this running backs game comes from his lack of speed, butBarber still has enough turbo in the tank to make his dreads fly out inthe open field.He is the older brother of Houston Texans safety Dominique Barber and the son of former New York Jets running back Marion Barber, Jr..Marion Barber Marion Barber Video HighlightsMarion Barber CareerHighlights and AwardsCareer highlights and awardsMusic City Bowl MVP (2004)Pro Bowl selection (2007)Career NFL statistics as of Week 17, 2009Rushing yards    3,984Rushing average    4.3Rushing TDs    43Stats at NFL.comMarion BarberDate of birth: June 10, 1983 Place of birth: Plymouth, MinnesotaHeight: 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m)Weight: 222 lb (101 kg)College: MinnesotaNFL Draft: 2005 / Round: 4 / Pick: 109Debuted: 2005 for the Dallas CowboysNFL Experience: 5th yearNFL Statistics: Career:715 carries, 3,052 yards  (4.3 yards/carry), 36 TDs, 137 receptions, 1,010 yards, 6 TDs.2008: 238 carries, 885 yards (3.7  yards/carry), 7 TDs, 52 receptions, 417 yards, 2 TDs. 2007: 204 carries, 975 yards (4.8 yards/carry), 10 TDs, 44  receptions, 282 yards, 2 TDs.

Photo -Sam Greenwood/Getty ImagesMaurice Jones DrewJacksonville JaguarsBy popular demand and my mistake from the start this list of the best running backs must include Maurice Jones Drew. MJD is a football player that is determined and utterly committed to winning. Maurice Jones Drew does it all, he runs, he blocks, he catches, and he returns kicks  while at the same time dispelling the myth that smaller players (he's 5' 7) can't make it in the pros. As a second-round pick out of UCLA in 2006, the diminutive Jones-Drew was supposed to be little more than a third-down back. You can argue with the stats for he has 45 career touchdowns and an average of nearly five yards. He has 3,270 career rushing yards and 178 catches for 1,606 yards and four touchdowns.Not only is Jones-Drew one of the NFLs premier players at his position, hes one of the leagues top trash-talkers. MJD is definitely fun to watch and in the past three seasons, Jones-Drew has become a one-man show and double-trouble for opponents as a runner and pass receiver.Career HighlightsNCAA Season RecordPunt return averageJacksonville Jaguars Record: All-PurposeYards in a Single Game (Week 14, '06 season)Jacksonville Jaguars Record: Single Season All-Purpose Yards (2,250 yards, 2006 season)2nd Place, AP Offensive Rookie of the Year.1x Pro Bowl selection (2009)1x Second-team All-Pro (2009) NFL Running Backs 2010 in the NewsNFL playoff previews: Baltimore Ravens at Kansas City Chiefs and Green Bay Packers at Philadelphia ECBS Sports8 hours agoSt. Petersburg Times staff writer Tom Jones breaks down todays NFL playoff games:Awards: Plenty of surprises, but Brady's greatness a constantCBS Sports4 days agoWho knew Arian Foster would be so good?

But Barber over MJD? wtfwavegirl228 months ago lololol oh Drew Breezzy - so funny you make me just crack up and I am not kidding . right off the top of my head  . . I was positive about the first 4 ..  absolutely undeniably. . and then when i went to pick the 5th. . I stumbled and headed over to twitter. . looking for you, shyne, YankeesGod2722 or SportingDude. . not one of you was around. . I knew you would tell me MJD and I almost almost did him . .but then well i do have a special place in my heart for the boys so I choice him .. MJD was a consideration but the Jags pissed me off at the end of last season . so voila  .. this is my list ;))))So ya think that Jackson will have a team to play with this year and actually win a few?? Im betting on Spags . they just may do Jackson some justice!ryan82477 months ago I think Chris Johnson is slightly better than Adrian Peterson. Peterson needs to learn how to hold on to the ball. Plus I would really like to see Chris Johnson and Usain Bolt go head to head. Check out some of my hubs man I liked yours.wavegirl227 months ago ryan8247 - CJ is something I have to agree ..

Although, I will say that LT is a biased pick all the way! :PAs for the Maurice Jones-Drew debate...I'm going to have to side with Drew Breezzy here. I mean, Barber, really? (you Cowboy sympathizer).Honestly, I say watch out for Chester Taylor. Although Chicago seems to have this curse for taking talent and flushing them down the tubes, I have a feeling Taylor is ready to explode. Had it not been for Peterson, Taylor would have been a top 10 back...perhaps top 5. (shrugs) We will see.Gemineye6 months ago Being a diehard Vikings fan - I love seeing AP high on your list.

Point well taken from both you and Drew. . but you know me by now and I am glad to see you understand how it works for me;) Chester Taylor is now on my radar and I am so looking forward to the season to see if the Bears can do something. . I cant really agree that there is a curse. .  some of the greats of the game have worn Bears uniform. .

I am counting the days till kickoff!! Thanks for stopping by . always great to meet a sports fan:)1kmjs5 months ago Seeing that this is a current listing, please take LT and Marion Barber off and replace them with Frank Gore and Maurice Jones Drew.

Best part about talking football is we each have our own opinions of who and what is best! Anyway you cut it, running backs in the NFL are my favorite players.Max3 months ago An amateur's take on the RB's for sure. LT hasn't been a top "RB" in a few years. The Marion Barber take makes me think you are a Dallas fan since it was a big stretch to even have him on this board. And having MJD at the bottom below Barber was the worst take I have ever read.Take a look at the top RBs taken in the 2010 fantasy drafts, and then compare it to this list just to see how far off you were.dev4life3 months ago L.T. is good running back but he is on the decline. I am Dallas Cowboys' fans but not sure if Barber is in Top 5 in the league. I agree Steven Jackson, Adrian Peterson, and Maurice Jones Drew belong on the list.  I guess the way I look at they are some slim pickings for good running backs in the league. Running backs are asked to do so much more than run and if running and pass catching is a part of criteria for good running back then list would include a player Reggie Bush. I know Bush does not get enough carries like the running back mentioned on your list; however he is effective. Ray Rice, and Carolina Panthers backfield of Jonathan Stewart and DeAngelo Williams are good also. Overall, I would only argue about two your picks.  I like L.T. and he is Hall Famer but he have not played at the level of greatness in about three years. This was a good article.wavegirl223 months ago @dev4life - totally appreciate your comment. Top ten lists especially in football always make for great conversations. As far as LT. . you gotta give the man some serious love for running up the middle for so many years. HOF. . you bet he will be wearing one of those yellow jackets. And Reggie, poor guy sitting this season on the sideline with a broken leg!! Feel free to stop by anytime . really enjoyed seeing your comment!Fenixfan3 months ago Love it. Glad someone still give LT credit. Even though his last season wasn't as productive as previous years, there's no doubt he still has a lot of tread on them tires.wavegirl223 months ago Fenisxfan - I hope the game against the Dolphins was the start of a great season to come for LT2 . .. ground and pound baby!!acanderson242 months ago My friend!! Hey this is a good hub...of course everyone has their pick of who the top five are...so it is good to see everyone weigh in on this. LT, a true "work horse". It is amazing how quickly people can write you off. Chris Johnson, blazing speed, just a tremendous talent. "AD"...Adrian Peterson, although I am not a Vikings fan, I love this kid. The fumbles, ehh, they can be corrected. Needs to whole the ball higher and tighter.(Ahhmm I might just know a little about that...lol) But his fumbles usually come with him trying to do the extra...Ahhmm Marion Barber? Well, I am a Cowboys fan. I can see where some may question his position on the list, but the list is about right now (before this season)....not too many other backs can control the clock like he can late in a game. Maurice Jones Drew...ok, he is exciting to watch....Last week, I watched some old videos of "the greatest show on turf", the Rams with Marshall Faulk....man, they were so exciting.....enough babbling lol....love your article!! I mentioned Marshall Faulk because I have a hot article coming up soon....(wink)....acanderson242 months ago Oh...I could never forgive myself for not talking about Steven Jackson!! You hit it on the head with the type of package he is....Just may never know how good he really is playing for the Rams. Oh yeah, do you know what Adrian Peterson worked on mainly in the off season? Speed. He said he wants to be a lot faster....wow...(I know he should have been working on "anti-fumbling" drills....lol)wavegirl222 months ago acanderson - Ha I heard Adrian placed a huge order for stickems during the off season. . i think he may even be wearing them. I am not a Viking lover but I sure do love me some Adrian. Of course this season is the season of the vintage running back. LT is just amazing, how lucky i feel to be a NY Jet fan and having him to cheer for, LaDainian Tomilson has never looked better!Thanks for coming by and leaving me such great comments!patriotsr12 months ago where is frank gore ,deanglo williams and jonathan stewart.marion barber seiously.wavegirl222 months ago and I take it patriotsr1 you area Pats fan?zatchj627 weeks ago There is six here?  I hope included Marion Barber to show what a top 5 RB SHOULDN'T be like :).  LT is great, but if you took the best and most productive right now he is out (Homer pick maybe?).  My order--from #1-#5--AD, CJ2K, MJD, and the next 2 spots are either R Rice, Franky G, S-Jax.wavegirl226 weeks ago zatchj62 - LOL six here, guess I cant count. . but one thing I know is for sure is that LaDainian Tomlinson is on this list and deservedly so! Hall of Fame here he comes, but first stop SUPERBOWL 2010. You know. . the motto .. Play Like a Jet, and my man LT is defining that one :)Dustin Tutt6 weeks ago I say jamaal charles is the best running back in the nfl have a 6.1 ypc average with over 800 yards and being 8th i think in the league hed be leading the pack if he had more carries because every other running back ahead of him is in the 4 ypc. the only other rusher whos in the nfl who has a better ypc is michael vickandrew6 weeks ago what about deshan maccouJamaal25charles4 weeks ago Jamaal Charles is way better than Marion barberTammy L2 weeks ago Great hub. I'm not going to argue whether Marion Barber should be on this list, but I will say he was the best the Cowboys had when Barber was in his prime.joe2 weeks ago oh jones-drew is by far the best back i this leage. cj is just fast and only breaks tackles when he's rnning 25 mph. peterson fumbles a lot and is overrated when talking abot his power. jones-drew is the best i'm not a jaguar fan so this isnt a homer pick but whenever i see him on tv, whether he s playing my beloved colts or what have yo the guy rns like he is mad at the grasswavegirl222 weeks ago Tammy = thanks for your comments.
