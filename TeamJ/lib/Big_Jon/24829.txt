Now something has changed. Congressional Democrats are challenging Republicans, daring them to come out against the bills more popular provisions. The Democratic National Committee is aggressively distributing talking points. According to an account in theNew York Times, Democrats will soon have a campaign-style war room for making their case. Its almost as if the the Democrats want this fight now.Of course, they may not have a choice. Republicans have made repeal a top priority, so the fight is going to take place whether or not Democrats want it. But I think it also reflects a changing dynamic, as well. According toGreg Sargent, who was among the first to spot the shift, House Democrats in particular are aware of the opportunity they missed last year, while the party and most of its leaders were trying so hard to save endangered incumbents. They think theyre in a stronger position now, since people are starting to see the laws benefits and repeal will mean changing an increasingly favorable status quo.It also helps that the Republicans finally have to do some governing. And governing requires the kind of specifics Republicans could avoid when they were merely campaigning to win office..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Politics, UpdatesCongress, Democrats, House Democrats, Politics, President Obama, Republicans/GOP, The Democrats losing the House, White HouseRead moreA quick look at the Defense Secretarys Budget that will go to Congress..January 6, 2011jamesb101No commentsWe give a quick look and some instant analysis with the knowledge that what actually happens will be a bit different in the end..Gateshad to cut $13 Billion from the increase he wanted in the budget figure.The Budget he presented is for $553 Billion.It does NOT include the direct war costs which has a separate budgetBut..RememberCongress writes the checks..This from Defense Tech..Well have a more detailed look at winners and losers the US Defense Secretary Robert Gatesoutlined today, but I thought it might help to get the discussion going and for those of you who werent watching it live to list the biggies nowF-35B will go on a two year probation and move to the back of the line on development behind the C and A model. More F/A-18EF Super Hornets will be purchased and older F/A-18 Hornets will have their service lives extended for the Marine Corps to make up for the B delay or cut.EFV is gone. Savings will be used to upgrade the AAV with more armor, better electronics and weaponry.Army SLAMRAAM canceled.The Non-Line of Sight Launch System gone.Drawdown by 27K Soldiers and up to 20K Marines from end strength in 2015Whats in  Air Force:More Air Force Reapers.More EELVs.Modernize F-15 radars.New long range nuclear strike bomber  that can be optionally piloted.More.This from the New York Times.Federal officials said Mr. Gates had been seeking to increase the basic Pentagon budget, excluding war costs, to $566 billion for fiscal 2012, but had to push the White House to approve $553 billion, or $13 billion less.That would be a slight increase over the $549 billion that the Pentagon had sought for 2011 and the moderately lower numbers that Congress is considering for this year.Gordon Adams, a Clinton administration budget official who served on Mr. Obamastransition team, said he understood that White House budget officials initially wanted to shave the Pentagons request by at least $20 billion for 2012.Mr. Adams said Mr. Gates viewed this as breaking an earlier promise, and he met withPresident Obama three times before Christmas to get at least $8 billion restored. Mr. Gates was also able to persuade the White House to reduce its demands for cuts over the next five years to $78 billion from $150 billion.But even so, Mr. Adams said, I think the floor under defense spending has now gone soft But given the Congress authorizes government spending a year at a time, he said, the projected numbers beyond 2012 are up for grabs. Dont count on any of it.Once Mr. Obama releases his budget proposals in February, the battle will shift to Capitol Hill, where it is hard to predict how the cross-currents will shake out now that the Republicans control the House..More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Military, Politics, The Economy, Updates$553 Billion figure, Congress, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Gates wanted more money, Program cuts, The Defense Budget, The White House, Winners/LosersRead moreCan the Defense Budget EVER be cut?.Discussion of the DayJanuary 6, 2011jamesb1017 commentsFrom the Washington Post.Gates to outline $100B in military savingsA long-troubled $14 billion program to build a landing craft for the Marine Corps is destined for the chopping block, defense officials and analysts said Wednesday, part of $100 billion in savings that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has pledged to squeeze from the Pentagons budget.Gates is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders Thursday to outline how he intends to save the $100 billion over the next five years by cutting weapons programs, Pentagon overhead costs and other portions of the Defense Departments massive bureaucracy. Gatesannounced in June that he would press the military services to find the savings with the incentive that they would be able to reinvest the money in programs essential to the current war effort and military modernization.The secretary will not only announce how much money we have saved and where we have saved it, but what new investments this will allow us to make, said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagons spokesman. This will be as much about investments as cuts.The headline of this piece is misleading.Defense Secretary Gates isnt looking to save a nickel.If you read the part from Pentagon spokesmen Morrell he clearly indicates that Gates is gonna take the saved money and use it someplace else..AndHell only be able to do that ifCongress lets him do that..So far just about every time Gates tries to kill a program.It pops back up from CongressOh, yea .Then there is this..U.S., NATO to spend $11.6B in Afghanistan The United States and its NATO allies plan to spend $11.6 billion this year buildingAfghanistans security forces, the largest yearly sum to date, as pressure mounts to shift responsibility for fighting the Taliban from the U.S.-led force toward local troops.The new funding pushes the total for 2010 and 2011 to nearly $20 billion, as much as in the seven previous years combined, said Lt. Gen. William B. Caldwell, the commander of NATOs training mission in Afghanistan. Funds already spent have purchased, among other things, 24,000 Ford Rangers, 108,000 9mm pistols, 74,000 handheld radios, 44 helicopters and four bomb-sniffing robots.Its an enormous undertaking that we do, Caldwell said.NATOs decision to offer details Wednesday about the vast quantity of equipment provided and the steep cost to foreign taxpayers follows public criticism by Afghan officials that the West has not given Afghan troops and police officers adequate weaponry.I submit to you that the US and NATO cannot and will not be leaving Afghanistan anytime soonAs part of that.I also submit that the Defense budget has TONS of waste in it..Just waste that can be cut without affecting the countries overall defense.Will those cuts affect jobs?SureWill those cuts have political ramifications?AbsolutelyThe question isCan cuts ever be done?Thats the Discussion of the Day..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Military, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesCan the Defense Budget EVER be cut?, Congress, Defense Sec Gates, Discussion of the Day, The Afgahn WarRead moreThe House AND Senate are trying for Operating Rules Changes.January 4, 2011jamesb101No commentsBy David Waldman @ Dailykos.Heres the 411 on the House.Hey there, Constitution fans! If you thoughtreading the Constitution out loud in the House of Representatives was all the founding document-y goodness there was contained in the Republican changes to the House Rules, dont worry!Theres more!And then they will require that every new bill contain a statement by the lawmaker who wrote it citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation.This is far more awesome, obviously, than the existing House Rule XIII (d)(1):(d) Each report of a committee on a public bill or public joint resolution shall contain the following:(1) A statement citing the specific powers granted to Congress in the Constitution to enact the law proposed by the bill or joint resolution.The statement of constitutional authority is being moved from the committee report, which is written after a bill is refined and amended in committee, to a slip of paper that accompanies the bill as its introduced,before all the changes are made.That should be pretty awesome right there! (Hey, I wonder what they would have put on that slip of paper for the 1996line-item veto legislation they passed, and that was later struck down by the Supreme Court. Im sure they can totally show the Court the piece of paper next time. Thatll learn em, the sociamalists!)There are also a couple ofsomewhat less exciting changesbeing made, too:Committee name changes: The Committee on Education and Labor will become the Committee on Education and Workforce, and the Committee on Science and Technology will become the Committee on Science, Space and Technology.The Committee on Education and Workforce, of course, is what Republicans used to call the same committee the last time they had the majority, enshrining their hatred for even thewordlabor. Actually, at first  in 1995  they called it the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, but I guess that was a little too dumb sounding even for them, and they switched it in 1997.The Committee on Science and Technology, of course, used to be called the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, only that was under the Democrats, who added Space to the name in 1987. In 1995, when Republicans took over, they deleted both Spaceand Technology, going with just the Committee on Science. Democrats re-added Technology in 2007. And now, Republicans will show how awesome they are by re-adding Space. (Dont tell them that Democrats were the ones who added Space the first time, or they might not do it!)The grown-ups are back in charge at last!Yes, there are more changes. And more serious ones at that. Well get to them. For right now, I just wanted you to know that U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! Number one! Wooooooo! America!!!! F yeah!!!!Heres the 411 on the SenateBy now youre aware that the effort to reform Senate rules kicks off, thanks to the efforts of Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) and his supporters, on the first day of the new Congress  this Wednesday, January 5th.Much has been made of the connection between Senate rules reform and that first day, but there are a few finer points that deserve discussion, and that might help you make sense of events as they unfold.First of all, we should get some sense of where the significance of the first day comes from. Weve discussed before how the Senate has in the past reconciled its constitutional right to adopt its own rules of procedure with its tradition as a continuing body. And perhaps the most comprehensive statement of how this paradox has been viewed comes from a 1957 advisory opinion delivered from the chair by then-Vice President (and President of the Senate) Richard Nixon, during a similar effort to reform Senate rules.Just to set this up for you, at the time he delivered this opinion, a motion to adopt new rules changes was the pending business, and reform opponents had moved to table the proposal, prompting one Senator to ask just what rules the Senate was then proceeding under:The constitutional provision under which only one-third of the Senate membership is changed by election in each Congress can only be construed to indicate the intent of the framers that the Senate should be a continuing parliamentary body for at least some purposes. By practice for 167 years the rules of the Senate have been continued from one Congress to another.The Constitution also provides that each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. This constitutional right is lodged in the membership of the Senate and it may be exercised by a majority of the Senate at any time. When the membership of the Senate changes, as it does upon the election of each Congress, it is the Chairs opinion that there can be no question that the majority of the new existing membership of the Senate, under the Constitution, have the power to determine the rules under which the Senate will proceed.The question, therefore, is, How can these two constitutional mandates be reconciled?It is the opinion of the Chair that while the rules of the Senate have been continued from one Congress to another, the right of a current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules, stemming as it does from the Constitution itself, cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a majority of the Senate in a previous Congress.Any provision of Senate rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it desires to proceed is, in the opinion of the Chair, unconstitutional. It is also the opinion of the Chair that Section 3 of Rule 22 in practice has such an effect.The Chair emphasizes that this is only his own opinion, because under Senate precedents, a question of constitutionality can only be decided by the Senate itself, and not by the Chair.At the beginning of a session in a newly elected Congress, the Senate can indicate its will in regard to its rules in one of three ways:First. It can proceed to conduct its business under the Senate rules which were in effect in the previous Congress and thereby indicate by acquiescence that those rules continue in effect. This has been the practice in the past.Second. It can vote negatively when a motion is made to adopt new rules and by such action indicate approval of the previous rule.Third. It can vote affirmatively to proceed with the adoption of new rules.Turning to the parliamentary situation in which the Senate now finds itself, if the motion to table should prevail, a majority of the Senate by such action would have indicated its approval of the previous rules of the Senate, and those rules would be binding on the Senate for the remainder of this Congress unless subsequently changed under those rules.If, on the other hand, the motion to lay on the table shall fail, the Senate can proceed with the adoption of rules under whatever procedures the majority of the Senate approves.In summary, until the Senate at the initiation of a new Congress expresses its will otherwise, the rules in effect in the previous Congress in the opinion of the Chair remain in effect, with the exception that the Senate should not be bound by any provision in those previous rules which denies the membership of the Senate the power to exercise its constitutional right to make its own rules. (Congressional Record, 85th Congress, 1st Session, January 4, 1957, pp. 178-179.)So what does that mean in terms of the importance of the first day? What it really means is that at some point before the Senate begins conducting its substantive business, there needs to be some clear and early objection to the continuance of the old rules. Its really about heading into the business of the new Congress with a clear definition of what rules will and will not be continuing in force, rather than being anything magical about the first day. The first day is just the best opportunity to guarantee that you can get that rules discussion started before any substantive business is conducted.Thats the key.During the last successful fight to change cloture rules, in 1975, that key objection was indeed made on the first day of the 94th Congress, but rather than have it out right then and there, the Senate agreed to a unanimous consent request to lock in all the rights Senators had to object to the rules on the first day, but postpone the actual debate until later that month:Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, in order to nail down doubly the protection accorded to the Senator and his cosponsors, I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding any delay in the consideration of the resolution, all proceedings, rights and privileges, concerning the efforts to change rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate be reserved, so that proponents of such a change not be prejudiced in any way in the actual commencement of the consideration of this resolution.As a result of the agreement, the 1975 rules reform debate actually stretched into early March of that year. Theoretically, the same could happen today.But youre probably already thinking that getting unanimous consent on this issue in the 112th Congress is probably about as close to impossible as anything can be.So what might happen instead? Well, the reform-minded Senators might have to stay there and fight  something that would have to start on Wednesday, but might actually continue for quite some time  all the while objecting to the conduct of substantive business under the old rules.The situation is somewhat complicated by Senate rules and practices (what a surprise!) such as, well, the definition of what constitutes the first day as well as how to define substantive business. Yes, even the definition of a day is like something out of Wonderland in the Senate. Because a legislative dayisnt the same thing as a calendar day:legislative day  A day that starts when the Senate meets after an adjournment and ends when the Senate next adjourns. Hence, a legislative day may extend over several calendar days or even weeks and months.If the Senate breaks in its proceedings with a recess rather than deciding to adjourn, the next calendar day is still a part of the same legislative day. So if theres no adjournment, the first day of the new Congress could  by this definition  last for days, weeks, or even months.As for what constitutes the kind of substantive business that could signal the acquiescence of the Senate to the old rules, nobodys sure exactly what that could mean, either. Most assume its the consideration of bills, resolutions, nominations and the like. But others say its any business, perhaps as routine as having the Senate chaplain offer an opening prayer. The definitive word will come from the Senate Parliamentarians office, and as usual, theyre not talking to the public, and neither is anyone whos talking to them.Well have to wait and see to find out whose definitions theyre working with, and what that might require reform leaders to do.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Law, Other Things, Politics, Updates112th Congress, Congress, Democrats in the Senate, Filibuster Rule change, House AND Senate are trying for Operating Rules Changes, Republicans/GOP, Rule changes, The House, The SenateRead moreThis Week in Congress.1/3/11.January 3, 2011jamesb101No commentsBy David Waldman @Dailykos.This week will kick off the 112th Congress.As youre aware, the House transitions to Republican control this year, which for purposes of our This Week and Today in Congress features, well have to rebuild our models for gathering and disseminating information on floor and committee schedules.Our usual source for House floor scheduling information is the Office of the Majority Leader. Its the Majority Leaders prerogative to set the schedule, so thats obviously where the best information comes from. During the last Congress, members of the Republican minority got their information on floor happenings from the Office of the Minority Whip. I expect that Democrats will likewise get their schedules from the Democratic Whip, Steny Hoyer, who of course was the Majority Leader in the 111th Congress.But the new Congress doesnt convene until Wednesday, and its only Monday now. That means there is no Republican-run Majority Leader web site to turn to for scheduling information just yet. Similarly, none of the new committee chairs have taken the keys to their sites yet, or posted their hearings schedules, if any. So I dont actually have that information for you today. I assume well start to see it closer to Wednesday.I do, however, have this:In the Senate, courtesy of theOffice of the Majority Leader:Convenes: 12:00 noonFollowing the presentation of the certificates of election and the swearing in of elected members, there will be a required live quorum. All senators are asked to report to the floor at that time. The Senate will then be in a period of morning business with senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.The Democrats, as we know, still have control of the Senate. So the floor schedule  for what its worth  is still available to us in the same place. Not that it tells us anything. It certainly makes no mention of the possibility of an opening day push for rules reform. But we know thats on tap.Speaking of which, its probably time to point something out about that. While Senate reformers have been pointing at the first day of the new Congress, January 5th, as the key day for starting debate on reform, the truth is that we just dont know yet whether the bulk of the debate  or even all that much of it  will actually take place on the 5th. Whats important about the method that the reformers, led by Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), have chosen is that theyll want to formally object right at the outset to the continuance of the Senates old rules, and instead move that there be an opportunity to amend them and/or adopt them anew. Thats not what the Senate normally does, though. They usually just assume that the old rules continue, unlike the House, which does overtly amend and readopt them every two years. The key thing under Udalls proposed procedure is that an objection should be made before any substantive business is done in the new Senate, since thats been the agreed-upon signal that the continuance of the rules has been agreed to.In past rules reform debates, after an initial objection was made, the reformers have sometimes secured unanimous consent agreements to actually postpone the debate while reserving all the rights to it that they claimed on the first day of the session. That has allowed the Senate to put the actual rules debate off for a while. Whether or not todays Senate will grant such a request may be a long shot, but then again, we dont know whether anyone will even ask for it. Well have to see how that develops, and well talk more about how it might later on.For now, all we can do is wait for everyone to swap the keys. But in the meantime, you can all take a look at these CRS reports to learn more about floor procedure on the first day of a new Congress:The First Day of a New Congress: A Guide to Proceedings on the Senate Floor (PDF)The First Day of a New Congress: A Guide to Proceedings on the House Floor (PDF)Oh, there is one other thing we can do.

The only factor that determines Senator Baucuss votes is whether a policy is right for Montana and right for our country.But ethics watchdogs complain that, in a race for money to help them win reelection, lawmakers routinely ignore congressional ethics rules that urge them to avoid fundraising around the same time that they are making key lawmaking decisions. The rules say that such sensitive timing could give the appearance that donors are improperly influencing decisions.The Washington Post found that the pattern of crunch-time fundraising has continued this year, even after a congressional investigative office warned this summer that it could violate ethics rules. The Post analysis  using data from two nonprofit organizations, the Center for Responsive Politics and the Sunlight Foundation  scrutinized lawmakers involved in pushing key legislation and donations made to them by interested parties.Citizens generally feel this kind of thing falls between the bookends of icky and bribery,  said David Levinthal, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics, which charts campaign donations and special interest influence. It makes people wonder: Is the donor making the donation because they are trying to get a particular legislative action? Or is the member soliciting the donation because they feel they have a whole bunch of special interests over a barrel at that moment and can profit from that?More.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Government, Law, Media, Other Things, Politics, UpdatesBig money donors, Buying influence, Campaign Finance, Company political donations, Congress, Ethics, fundraising, legislation, Soliciting fundsRead moreThank You Mr. President.Democrats and YesRepublicans.December 23, 2010jamesb101No commentsThank You Mr. PresidentFor taking a hit from the Mid-Terms and doubling down and moving ahead WITH the GOPThank You for turning away from the Liberals and the Tea PartyAnd finding a middle like the American people want you toThank you for sticking to it and getting the Healthcare Bill.Thank you for making the Planet safer with your push for START.I promise to think twice before threateningto take my Hillary signs out of the closet again.Thank you DemocratsFor jumping off the cliff on Healthcare.You did the right thing.Thank you for going along with YOUR party leader and OUR President in the last week on so many Bills.And Finally..Thank you Republicans.For focusing the President on what was important.Thank you for bringing a reality check to the Democratic left wing that lives sometimes in Oz..Thank you for NOT following Senator DeMint and the other knuckleheads with Just Vote NoThank you cutting the deals with Your President and Ours.This Dog wanted to get this out.Because someone had to say this.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Healthcare, Law, Military, Politics, UpdatesCongress, Democrats, President Obama, republicans, Thank YouRead moreRepost: Rep.
