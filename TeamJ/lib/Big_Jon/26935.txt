Doctors treating Giffords report that they are very, very encouraged by her ability to respond to simple commands and are optimistic about her chances for survival. Doctors have also been successful in controlling her bleeding. The bullet went through Giffords head on the left side of the brain, but she has been able to respond to commands such as squeezing a hand and showing two fingers. Doctors say the fact that Giffords survived is a combination of good luck and the fact that surgeons got to her quickly. Giffords is communicating by responding to simple commands, Michael Lemole, chief of neurosurgery at University of Arizonas University Medical Center, said at a news conference today. She cant open her eyes and brain swelling is the biggest threat after a bullet traveled the length of her brains left side, doctors said. When you get shot in the head and the bullet goes through your brain, youre lucky if you survive and youre lucky if you wake up, said Peter Rhee, medical director at the hospitals trauma center. Things are going very well and were very happy at this stage. The bullet traveled through the left hemisphere of her brain and out of her head, doctors said. It did not cross from one brain hemisphere to the other, Lemole said. One of the things most concerning to doctors in the wake of a shot to the head is whether the bullet crossed "through the geometric center," he added. Charges in yesterdays shootings will be filed today against Jared Loughner, 22, Robert MuellerRobert Mueller, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said at a news conference in Tucson. Its too early to speculate on Loughners motives, he said. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said a person of interest for whom authorities are still searching may not have been involved in this incident at all.        2 of 35         RIP Gabrielle Giffords & others      shahzaib chaudhary is based in Islamabad, Federal Capital Area, Pakistan,and is Stringer for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (60.9%) Canada (13.6%) Pakistan (4.5%) Italy (2.7%) 14 other countries (15.5%)           READ MORE: disasters-news, tucson, Robert Mueller, Joe Arpaio, State governments of the United States, Arizona, Health Medical Pharma, Peter Rhee, Michael Lemole, Clarence Dupnik, Jared Loughner, Gabrielle Giffords   More News From: Tucson :  AZ :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 27            Reply  Posted By     shahzaib chaudhary|about 7 hoursagowow thats very wonderful news,good to hear that            Reply  Reply By     Junaid143|about 6 hoursagoWhile I don't live in the county like your self and Im not familiar with his policies, I thought the Sheriff came across as honest and direct.
