Joe Lieberman (I-CT)Republicans just took back control of the House and, at least right now, theyre in a strong position to retake the Senate in two years, according to an analysis of the 2012 Senate field by political scientist Larry Sabato.As Sabato points out, the Democratic caucus currently holds 23 of the 33 Senate seats that will be on the line in 2012, meaning they have much more to lose than the GOP. Democrats will have to play a lot more defense and hope for help in the form of a strong down ticket effect from President Obama.Also worrisome for Democrats, Sabato rates seven of those seats, six of them now in Democratic hands, as toss ups. If those races split four to three in favor of Republicans, and the two parties hold the rest of their seats, Republicans would swing their current 53-47 Senate minority into a 50-50 tie.Read more Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, Updates2012 Senate races, Larry Sabado, Polling, PredictionsRead moreJeb Bush Challenge Florida Senator Bill Nelson?December 27, 2010jamesb101No commentsWould he run?[Nelson and Bush...]Florida Republicans Want Jeb Bush to Challenge NelsonFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is the strong favorite among Republican voters to challenge Sen. Bill Nelson (D) in 2012, a new Public Policy Polling survey shows.Tom Jensen, director of the Democratic-leaning polling firm, said the findings  72 percent of GOP voters chose Bush as their preferred candidate  differ from other state surveys in which voters have no clue whom they want to challenge the Democratic incumbent.With Bush in the equation none of the other options given get any higher than 6%  thats for perennial candidate Bill McCollum  and once you get past McCollum no one else even tops 3%, Jensen wrote on the PPP blog.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, Updatesex-Fla Gov Jeb Bush, Florida Senator Bill Nelson (R), PollingRead moreSorry FolksBut Obama STILL has good numbersDecember 16, 2010jamesb10120 commentsObama is Likeable EnoughFirst Read notes that one of the main forces benefiting President Obama is that an overwhelming number of Americans find him likeable.He gets his highest marks in the poll for having a strong family and family values (74% give him a high rating here), being easygoing and likeable (68%), being inspirational and exciting (51%), and having strong leadership qualities (49%). His lowest marks come on the professional side: being a good commander-in-chief (41%), achieving his goals (33%), uniting the country (30%), and changing Washington (24%). Bottom line: The jurys still out on whether the president is going to be successful or not, as over 40% tell us its STILL too soon to judge what kind of president Obama is going to be.Reassuring Signs for Obama in PennsylvaniaA newQuinnipiac poll in Pennsylvania finds President Obama in decent shape heading into the 2012 campaign, with improving approval numbers and strong support for his recent deal with Republicans on tax cuts.Pennsylvanians now narrowly approve of President Obamas job performance 44% to 43%, the first time since March 2009 that he has had positive net approval in the state. There is also overwhelming support for the tax cut deal, 69% to 24%, with independents providing a stronger level of support than Republicans or Democrats, 72% to 20%.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesObama Poll numbers, Obama Polls well in Pennsylvania, Polling, President ObamaRead moreScott Brown is crusin right nowBut hes gonna have a fight.December 2, 2010jamesb1014 commentsBrown has good leads right nowBut knows that the Democrats in that state arent happy that Ted Kennedys seat is in GOP handsBrown is gonna have to come down on the Democrats side in a few votes in the next two years.PPP Poll: GOPer Scott Brown In Good Shape In Heavily Dem MassachusettsSenator Scott Brown (R-MA)A new survey of Massachusetts fromPublic Policy Polling (D) finds Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who won a tremendous upset victory in last Januarys special election to succeed the late Democratic icon Ted Kennedy, to be in good shape heading into his 2012 re-election bid.Brown is in front of a number of hypothetical Democratic opponents. He leads Rep. Mike Capuano, who had previously lost the Democratic primary in that special election, by 52%-36%. Brown leads Rep. Stephen Lynch by 49%-30%, leads Rep. Ed Markey by 49%-39%, and leads Gov. Deval Patrick by 49%-42%. In addition, Brown leads Vicki Kennedy, the widow of Ted Kennedy, by 48%-41%.Browns approval rating is 53%, to only 29% disapproval.From the pollsters analysis: In a sign of how moderate and mainstream Browns image is, 53% say his views are about right, something only 32% say of the GOP as a whole. Likewise, 52% think the Republicans too conservative, but only a third say that of Brown. Even 35% of Democrats see Browns ideology as acceptable, though half do think him too far right.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesMass Sen Scott Brown (R), moderate Republican, PollingRead moreSurprising American public opinion on wars, past and present..November 14, 2010jamesb101No commentsFrom Chris Bowers @ DaikykosThis post points out that contrary to some peoles beliefs ..Americans arent just of one opinion the actions of this countiries military and its leaders..The lack of breaking polling information caused by the endof the 2010 elections has left poll junkies such as myself with a void in our daily routines. While I am still reflectively opening my bookmarks to polling websites, it is usually only after I notice the lack of new polls on Senate battlegrounds and generic congressional ballots that I remember the 2010 election is over.Now, in order to get my fix for polling, I have started to look at historical surveys. In so doing, I have discovered what are, at least to me, some stunning revelations about public opinion on American involvement in overseas wars during the past century.Some of these polls might surprise you, too. Consider:1. World War One was deeply unpopular.Although public opinion polling was not around during World War One, there are strong suggestions that the public was deeply opposed to American involvement in the war.For one thing, in 1920, two years after the official end of the war on the Western front, Democrats suffered the most severe defeat of any major party in any Presidential election in American history. The ticket of James Cox, and some politically toxic VP nominee nicknamed FDR (who totally should have retired from politics, instead of endangering the electoral future of the Democratic Party),lost the popular vote by 26.17%.Electoral luminaries such as Hebert Hoover, Alf Landon, Barry Goldwater, George McGovern, and Walter Mondale all did better than Democrats did in 1920. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for President Woodrow Wilsons post-election reversal on American involved in the Great War.Secondly, once public opinion polling did start appearing in the 1930s,early surveys on World War One showed only 28% of the country thought entering the war was a good idea, while 64% opposed it. Even as public opinion in favor of war increased after France fell to Nazi Germany during World War Two, only 42% of the country thought entry into World War One was a good idea, while 39% of the country still considered it a mistake. Given this, it seems unlikely that public support for World War One was ever in the majority.2. Younger Americans were significantly more in favor of the Vietnam War than older Americans.Check out the age crosstabs on this1970 Gallup poll on the Vietnam War:During both the early and later stages of the Vietnam war, older Americans were actually the core of opposition to the war, while younger Americans were the core of support. That is in stark opposition to the cultural memory on the divide over Vietnam, which generally portrays it as dovish college hippies vs. hawkish older conservatives.Being born in 1974, I neither have any first-hand experience of how the national divide was portrayed during the Vietnam War, nor any clear idea of how our collective memory of that divide has became so disconnected from demographic reality. Perhaps the most prominent protests were dominated by young Americans. Perhaps the divide over Vietnam has been mistakenly folded into the massive, concurrent cultural divide between the generations. If anyone could provide any thoughts on this in the comments, Id love to read them.3. Reports on violence in Iraq decreased support for troop withdrawal.Finding these older polls also reminded me of some more recent, surprising polls on our current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Take, for example,this poll from Time in mid-2007:Q 83) As you may know, a report about the situation in Iraq by General David Petraeus, the Commander of U.S. forces, and others is scheduled to be released next week. If the report says that the situation in Iraq is IMPROVING, what should the U.S. do next: should the U.S. increase the number of U.S. troops in Iraq, keep the same number of U.S. troops in Iraq as there are now, decrease the number of troops in Iraq, or remove all its troops from Iraq? QUESTIONS 83-84 WERE ROTATED.Increase: 6%Keep the same: 32%Decrease: 39%Remove All Troops: 17%DK / NA: 6%Q 84) If the report says that the situation in Iraq is GETTING WORSE, what should the U.S. do next: should the U.S. increase the number of U.S. troops in Iraq, keep the same number of U.S. troops in Iraq as there are now, decrease the number of troops in Iraq, or remove all its troops from Iraq? QUESTIONS 83-84 WERE ROTATED.Increase: 16%Keep the same: 27%Decrease: 25%Remove All Troops: 22%DK / NA: 9%Americans were much more supportive of withdrawing troops from Iraq in 2007 if they were told things were going well in the country. As such, media reports on violence, which were often echoed and emphasized by online progressives to help make the case for withdrawing troops, were actuallydecreasing public support for withdrawal. At the same time, pro-escalation Republicans attacked the news media for focusing too extensively on violence in Iraq. They did so in the mistaken belief that such stories would increase public support for troop withdrawal.As it turns out, the media strategy on both sides of the debate was self-defeating.4. AfghanistanThere are quirks to public opinion and Afghanistan, too.Most notably, back in 2009, Democrats approved of President Obamas handling of the war by a 2-1 margin, even though they opposed his policies by the same 2-1 margin. Meanwhile, Republicans disapproved of President Obamas handling of the war by a 3-1 margin, even though they approved of his policies by a 3-1 margin. It would seem that on Afghanistan, most people were (and likely still are) approving or disapproving of President Obamas partisan affiliation, rather than his policies.****I share all this with you not with any specific point in mind, except perhaps that we should be wary of making assumptions about what American the public thinks of our involvement in overseas wars.It isnt as easy to stereotype as one might expect.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Government, Media, Men, Military, Politics, UpdatesPolling, polling on American opinion of wars and military actions, PollsRead morePollsters warn about those among them that are working FOR campaigns not just polling.November 9, 2010jamesb101No commentsNate Silver has been pointing this out at FivethirtyeightAnd this Dog has been complaining about this alsoPollsters Warn of Polls that Impact CampaignsA bi-partisan group of campaign pollsters issued anopen letter blasting the sometimes uncritical media coverage of the proliferation of public pre-election polls that fail to disclose basic information about how they are conducted and that have the capacity to shape media and donor reactions to election contests,Mark Blumenthal reports.First Read: These pollsters zeroed in on  correctly  the BIGGER problem with public polling these days: the narrative-setting polls released (mostly by robo-pollsters) very early on in campaigns. Nobody can ever check the accuracy of these polls; pollsters only get graded toward the end of the campaign when, frankly, many of them can weight their way to semi-accuracy. The bottom line: The flooding the zone aspect of these dial-a-pollsters has ruined the study of public opinion and made pollsters who spend the money to do it right look obsolete. At NBC/MSNBC, we advise all our platforms against using many of these unreliable pollsters. What the industry needs is an agreed-upon grading system that ALL major media would follow.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Politics, Polls, UpdatesPolling, Polling methodolgy, Polls that Impact CampaignsRead moreThe differance between bias and house effect at FivethirtyeightNovember 6, 2010jamesb101No commentsFrom Nate Silver over @ FivethirtyeightHe s got Ramussen Polling in mind, in this post.***I got an e-mail from Richard S. that gets at a distinction that is key to understanding Thursdays column onthe performance of various polling firmsin Tuesdays elections, in which I referred to the bias present in the results obtained by certain pollsters (particularly Rasmussen Reports). He writes:Ive been following 538 for a long time, and I was curious about your change in terminology from house effect to bias. You have always been very careful in previous posts to use the former term, often stressing that the house effect was a result of methodology and did not necessarily reflect any intentional bias on the part of the pollster. In your post today you repeatedly used the term bias instead.I understand that in statistics bias is the correct term for such systematic errors in data collection, but when discussing opinion polling house effect seems to be the more common term; and I fear that for lay people reading your blog the term bias is likely to be interpreted as suggesting a deliberate skewing of results rather than poor procedure. Is there a reason youve chosen to use the term bias in this article rather than house effect?The most important thing to note is that there are two separate terms here  house effects and bias  that I use in distinct ways.When I talk about ahouse effect, I mean what results a pollster showsrelative to those of other polling firms. If everyone else shows the Republican Sharron Angle ahead by 3 points in Nevada and some other pollster comes along showing Harry Reid ahead by 5 points, that would be an 8-point Republican-leaning house effect.Bybias, I mean how a pollsters resultscompared with the actual outcome of the election. In the example above  since Mr. Reid won by about 5 points  the pollster showing him winning by that margin would have anunbiased poll, even though it had a strong house effect. In contrast, the pollsters with Ms. Angle ahead would have a strong Republican-leaning bias, even though they hadnt had any house effect.Put another way: house effects are what we look at before the election; bias is what we look at after the election.*House effects are undoubtedly predictive of bias to a certain extent, but youd be surprised by the number of exceptions.Read more* ( Highlights by the Dog..)Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Politics, Pollshouse effect and bias effect, NateSilver@Fivethirtyeight, Polling, Rasmussen/Pulse PollingRead moreThe Map for 2012..First Read.November 5, 2010jamesb10122 commentsFirst Look at the 2012 MapFirst Read looks at where we believe things will be a year from now, with the GOP candidates headed into home stretch in IA.

And the lean GOP states are winnable by a Democrat if things break, well, 53%-47% nationally for the president.

Sometimes, the local error will run in the same direction as the national error, and sometimes it wont. For instance, in one simulation of the Colorado Senate race, our random number generator came up with a national error of Republican +3, but a local error of Democrat +4. Add the two together, and the simulation moves the forecast toward the Democrat by 1 point overall. (Just as in the real world, sometimes local factors make more difference than national trends.)He goes on to explain that these errors can lead to vastly incorrect assumptions.Well, what a difference one little assumption makes. In the dumbed-down forecast, the margin of error is plus or minus about 8 seats  that is, 52  8  so Republicans can almost always be counted upon to win between 44 seats and 60. This implies that the Democrats have almost no chance of losing fewer than 39 seats. Having them to hold the House under these assumptions would be like asking them to come up with heads 35 times in 40 coin flips: possible, but not very likely.The real FiveThirtyEight forecast, however, has a margin of error of plus-or-minus29 seats. This means that the Democratsdo have a substantial chance of retaining control of the House  about 20 percent. But it also means that Republican gains in excess of 60 seats are quite possible (better than a 30 percent chance).The blue line, the dumbed-down forecast, certainly looks a lot tidier and makes for a better headline. The Republicans will win between 44 and 60 seats sounds punchy and confident. The Republicans will win between 23 and 81 seats sounds like you dont know what youre talking about.The problem is that the blue line, however attractive and well-behaved, does not reflect the situation in the real world. And it has a good chance of being wrongIn the end Silver hedges his bets gain like he has for the last few weeks ..This Dog has also..More..Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Politics, Polls, UpdatesCharlie Cook Predictions, Could one mistake in Cook poll have the Democrats keep the House?, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Polling, statisticsRead morePage 1 of 6123...6Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (144) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent CommentsDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Pima County Sheriffs complaint of political vitriol is on point..Discussion of the Dayjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..
