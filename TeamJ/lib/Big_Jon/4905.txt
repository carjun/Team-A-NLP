When I was a kid, we were going to take a pill to eat our meals in the future, as if that's what people wanted to do. How does that explain people building high end kitchens with pizza ovens or people making their own bread at home. Houses would be covered with glass domes or something. Heck, here in California, there are new houses built in 2011 that are modeled after Spanish missions.I recall one of the main reasons for making front-wheel drive cars given back in the 60s and 70s was to get rid of the big transmission tunnel as cars got lower. However, when they finally got around to making front drive cars, they went to bucket seats with center consoles, so the hump was of little consequence. Go figure.I suspect that when people are tired of texting, a new fad of calligraphy with sweep the nation. They made front loading washing machines back in the 1940s and 50s and then stopped. Now they are back again.Bottom line. Whatever they predict for the future, imagine the opposite and see what really happens. I bet we reverse 'going global' and start 'going local' at some time in the future.
