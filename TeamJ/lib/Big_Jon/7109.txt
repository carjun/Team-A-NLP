I could edit it and take out that opinion from a vandal but how will that prevent any further Libel and misinformation on wikipedia? So how do you report the user who wrote it? And if it was written by someone with connections to rush limbaugh then it would be news worthy information. So what is the proper way to deal with Libel?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_SoltzCasarrubius 00:48, 28 September 2007 (UTC)CasarrubiuCasarrubius 00:48, 28 September 2007 (UTC)I've removed the vandalism from this article and issued a warning to the IP editor who added it. The IP address of the user has been associated with vandalism leading to a block before. Any user who persists in vandalizing articles is subject to warning and blocking. You can report obvious and persistent vandals at Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism. Before posting there, a final warning in an escalating series should have been posted to the user's talk page (for example {{Uw-vandal4}}, {{Uw-spam4}} or {{Uw-speedy4}}), and the user must have vandalized within the last few hours, including after the final warning was given him or her. Various warning templates can be found at Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace. Your block request is unlikely to be acted upon unless you follow these steps. Cases that are not simple vandalism can be reported at WP:AN/I. Of course, in conjunction with warning against and reporting vandalism, you have the ability, mandate and are encouraged to revert all instances of vandalism you find yourself. In specific cases of libel, you might also want to report persistent abuse to Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard. Thanks for pointing this out. --Moonriddengirl 00:59, 28 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] Alternative Meaning for "Mediation" ArticleQUESTION: CAN THERE BE ALTERNATIVE ARTICLES THAT USE THE SAME WORD, BUT DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF IT?Longer version: I'm a graduate student at Michigan State University, and I want to write an article on "mediation" which is both a term used in Marxist theory, and a term used in media theory.The problem is, there is already an entry for mediation, which depicts the most common meaning: to resolve conflicts. I'd like to make the argument that I should be able to create a separate article with my meanings that are so radically different from the norm. I feel it is misleading to edit the current article, as it would direct readers away from my alternative meanings.This is not a term I am making up. I have plenty of sources on it. Ggetto79 Preceding signed but undated comment was added at 01:02, 28 September 2007 (UTC)This happens frequently, so we have a guideline page that tells what to do: Wikipedia:Disambiguation. --Teratornis 01:06, 28 September 2007 (UTC)The link above is a good place to find out about this idea. An example would be Ball (mathematics) vs. Ball (dance). For mediation we have Mediation, Mediation (Statistics), and Data mediation. So, in theory, you could create an article at a place like Mediation (Marxism). -Andrewc[talk] 01:52, 28 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] HELPPPPPPPPPP!HOW DO I FIND NAMES IDENTIFYING STATE ORIGIN?

If the photo is giving an example of a country's culture, what is the leniency for how prevalent and familiar the style of culture depicted in the photo can be in that country? E.g. prevalent across 50% of the population with 90% of the population being familiar with it seems clearly adequate, but how about 1% prevalent and 5% familiar? Is there a limit? 0.0001% prevalent and 0.1% familiar? Thanks in advance for any advice. -- Thoreaulylazy 03:19, 28 September 2007 (UTC)I don't think this is a problem of WW:Weight at all. WP:Weight refers to the problem of differing points of views. The existence of a culture is no point of view, it is a fact. There only could be problems in relation to WP:Notability, but a whole culture, as small as it could be, should be notable (including an image). See for excample Sorbs, a minority of 60,000.- persons among 80,000,000.- Germans. The limit is the existence of a culture. Five persons doing the same thing are no culture.You should only look for the evaluation within the article. It is not good, to write five sections with ten images about a minority culture and to show the main culture with only one sentence, if the article is about the whole country. Then you should think about an article of it's own about the minority culture. Preceding unsigned comment added by Thw1309 (talk  contribs) 06:55, 28 September 2007 (UTC)I see, but in your example, were you talking about 60,000 adherents or persons familiar with it in Germany? There is a separate article about just the .0001% subgroup, which consensus is okay with, but there are questions surrounding whether it belongs in the main country's article's Culture section (the country is multiethnic, with a demographic split: 80% 13% 3% and a couple 1% and many, many <1% and this one group in question is .0001%) Is there a fine line between 60,000 and 5. For example, is .0001%, or 80 adherents of a population of 80 million, and perhaps ten times as many familiar with it, so 800 familiar with the practice out a population of 80 million, sufficient for WP:Weight/WP:Notability for inclusion in the main nation's article? Thanks -- Thoreaulylazy 12:59, 28 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] rn ~ mMaybe it's just the case for my current screen, but it's almost impossible to distinguish an italic rn from an m. Is there any way to resolve this problem? --KnightMove 08:56, 28 September 2007 (UTC)The only thing I can think of is changing your browser font size with Ctrl + Scroll button. Of course, that's a crude solution. Leebo T/C 11:35, 28 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] Depreciated TemplatesWhat is a depreciated template? HarrisonB Speak! 10:44, 28 September 2007 (UTC)I think you mean "Deprecated". This is where a template has become outdated and has become superseded by a better template. It basically means that it should no longer be used. It is usually stated where duplicate templates have been formed and one has become more developed than the other. Is there a specific template that you were refering to? Woodym555 10:52, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Deprecation explains the general meaning of the word. It's not specific to Wikipedia or templates. PrimeHunter 14:47, 28 September 2007 (UTC)The template 'click' is the one that I mean. Why has it been depreciated? HarrisonB Speak! 09:55, 29 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] Change picture.Dear Wikipedia Team,I am trying to edit a page and I would like to update a picture. The page in question is Kilometer 31 or KM 31 and it is a horror movie stub page. The picture that has been placed there is old and I would like to update it as there has been a new one to come out. Also it is now in English and I believe more relivant to the audience that would look at the page.Many ThanksDaniel Preceding unsigned comment added by Daniel4450 (talk  contribs) 11:26, 28 September 2007 (UTC)You can upload a new picture by following the instructions at Wikipedia:Upload. The image is probably copyrighted, so you'll need to write a fair use rationale for it (see Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline) even if the current picture didn't have a properly written one (it never hurts to start doing it the right way). You can learn more about images at Wikipedia:Images. Leebo T/C 11:31, 28 September 2007 (UTC)It's easier to upload the picture you have in mind separately and insert it in the article, while moving the original to another spot in the article. Also, make sure you know how to properly tag its copyright status and source. If you do that incorrectly and replace the existing image, you might end up with no image at all. - Mgm|(talk) 11:33, 28 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] changing page name - removing user:hi i am not sure if this is possible but I am editing a page and its full name has "user:" and then the page name, is there any way to remove this and just have the page name? also is there a way to enable pages you edit to be found using the search feature on wikipedia?thanks.Jthemuppet 12:26, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Once the article is placed in article space, it will be automatically included in the search feature on Wikipedia. Please be sure that the page meets notability, verifiability and neutrality guidelines before renaming it.:) Pages are renamed by moving them to new target names. This procedure preserves the page's edit history. Please do not rename a page by copying/pasting its content to a new page name. If you have an account and it is at least four days old, you can move a page yourself, but please first review Wikipedia:Naming conventions. If you still wish to rename the page, go to it and click the move tab at the top (near the history and watch tabs). You can then specify a new name for the article. The old page name will automatically become a redirect to the new page. However, if the desired target page name already exists, you will need an administrator to move the page for you, which can be requested at Wikipedia:Requested moves. Hope this helps. --Moonriddengirl 12:32, 28 September 2007 (UTC)I do believe the page you are refering to is User:Dynamo Barnet FC. This is a userpage, which means that there is a user with that name, and it's page contains information about Dynamo Barnet FC. There once was a page Dynamo Barnet FC, but it has been deleted for Very short articles without context. and No content other than external links of whatever kind, or an attempt to contact subject of article.. The content at the time was what you can now find as the first version of the userpage: [[2]]. You are free to move the page as mentioned above, but I have my doubts about the subjects notability and verifiability. (you will find these terms are used a lot, and often simple called WP:N and WP:V for their shortcuts). If you are sure that the article satisfies the notability guideline and the verifiability policy, go ahead and make the move.

Pedro: Chat 13:07, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Stories in the literary sense are best sold to publishers or magazines, or sent to an agent for representation.

We have been trying all week to create a wiki page for our school where our students can research and create documents on wiki. Our page was initially flagged for speedy deletion, and I put a hold on it to discuss. I contacted the user who flagged us and made a good faith effort to revise our page as well as put an adoption request notice on our page. Despite all of this, our page was deleted less than 24hrs after our initial post and the flags. What happened here? Any help or info would be greatly appreciated!Thanks, Harlemacademy 14:02, 28 September 2007 (UTC)The bottom line is that you shouldn't be creating a Wikipedia article about the school for the purpose of providing a place where your "students can research and create documents on wiki". Wikipedia has very strict requirements for inclusion. Just be cause Wikipedia is the only wiki most people have heard of doesn't make it the best choice for what you need. I would recommend another wiki, or perhaps starting a school wiki. Leebo T/C 14:49, 28 September 2007 (UTC)While I can not see the page that was deleted, the notes say it was deleted due to it being essentially an advertisement, and was deleted under the "Wikipedia is not a free webhost" clause of What Wikipedia Is Not. Is order for a page to stay, it needs to be written as an encyclopedia entry, and must be notable for something, must not contain any original research done by the author, and have both of the previous requrements backed up by verifiable sources. I would suggest reading up on the links I included above, and if you can re-write the article to satisfy those, you should be able to re-create the article without garnering any controversy. Hope this helps! Arakunem 14:52, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Harlemacademy has smiled at you! Smiles promote WikiLove and hopefully this one has made your day better.

All the ones in the Gnomon article which I checked were licensed under the GFDL. Any of those will be fine for what you are planning, so long as you keep the same license(s) for the new versions you upload on Wikimedia Commons. You should include a link to the original source of the image and a note to say that you modified and/or translated that image. Other than that there are no hoops to jump through.

THe gist of what I got was that their was doubt about wether or not he was notable enough to have a section. I belive he is, I just htink that maybe I didn't express the ways he is notable well enough. Do I need to provide a link to the shows he was on instead of just naming it? Should I list his almbums and colaborations? His website has scans of articals about him, but I am not sure of the links to the actual publications. Do I need them, or is linking to his personal site enough?--Jnifr 19:16, 28 September 2007 (UTC)JnifrWe need impartial, outside sources that speak to his notability. His own website is not useful here. Are the shows he was on significant? Are his albums selling? Does he collaborate with notable performers, and can you document it? --Orange Mike 19:22, 28 September 2007 (UTC)I don't agree here Mike, his site only archives the articles, the real source of the material are the newspapers who provided the articles. As long as those publications can be named, it wouldn't hurt to link to a copy on his site - especially when the original is no longer available online. - Mgm|(talk) 14:22, 29 September 2007 (UTC)Also, the criteria at Wikipedia's guidelines for notability of musical performers are pretty well spelled out. If memory serves, there are twelve of them. You should be sure that your subject passes one of them, at least. Into The Fray T/C 19:29, 28 September 2007 (UTC)I usually don't start an article about a singer/band until they meet at least two or more of the criteria just to be safe. - Mgm|(talk) 14:22, 29 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] ?????????????????????What do i do if some one puts bad content on the site say, the sand box?--19:54, 28 September 2007 (UTC)66.181.112.125Well, the sandbox is not really a great concern, since it gets cleaned regularly. You can just blank the sandbox if somone puts up something inappropriate. For articles and other pages, see Wikipedia:Vandalism for information on how vandalistic edits are handled. Leebo T/C 19:58, 28 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] complaint Simon Wessely pageAn Admin has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source on the Simon Wessely page. Another editor, Suzy Chapman, and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but it feels we are running around in circles. Now another editor has come in expressing a determination to remove our comments on the TALK page as irrelevant. Granted the comments are lengthy, but this is the case in other Wikipedia talk pages also. Weve also been implied as engaging in 'spurious arguments' which I think is an inaccurate and perjorative comment, and other rather adversarial comments which weve had to rebut, reasonably. The reason for the long posts in any case is because weve been trying to establish the reasons NOT to publicise unreliable information.IF this publication of unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source, goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson panel may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources will be evident. Jim Wales has been aware of the problems around this page, and even though he has not been supportive of my position in the past, I think he should be made aware of this problem as soon as possible. In any case this page needs careful investigation urgently. Angela Kennedy 20:34, 28 September 2007 (UTC)This page is not dispute resolution, which I urge you to pursue. Leebo T/C 20:39, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Leebo, where can we ask for an IP check? A single-purpose anonymous user popped up and started deleting other users' contributions on the talk page. His/her own contributions sound like he is a seasoned user, possibly an admin. Guido den Broeder 22:55, 28 September 2007 (UTC)I doubt it. Admins know how deleting other people's talk comments can get you banned and they know they run the risk of having their IP checked. If an admin would do such a thing they'd be stripped of their abilities. - Mgm|(talk) 14:19, 29 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] HelloI have recently created an account and i was wondering how to add my list of hobbies on my user page.--Masked defender 21:02, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Masked defenderYou may wish to consider whether such content helps the encyclopedia in some way. That said, you can edit your user page the same way you edit any other page. There should be a red link to it in the upper right corner of your screen, on the leftmost side of the links that include "my talk", "my prefereces", etc etc. Friday (talk) 21:05, 28 September 2007 (UTC)I saw the lists on user talk pages ex.This user plays the halo video game. THANK YOU!!!.--Masked defender 21:13, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Masked defenderDo you mean userboxes? There is a meta-list of them at the bottom of this page. --Bfigura (talk) 21:26, 28 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] Hey!How come the cheatsheet does not teach you to make templates and fonts? I need to know this stuff! I'm gonna be mad if no one responds to me!--Arceus fan 21:23, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Template help is available at Help:Template. What do you mean by fonts? (And by the way, getting mad may not be the best way to elicit help). Cheers, --Bfigura (talk) 21:30, 28 September 2007 (UTC)This is a font --Ageyban 21:37, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Right. I wasn't sure if the user wanted to make a font, or just change it (for sig purposes). I should have been clearer. Cheers, --Bfigura (talk) 21:49, 28 September 2007 (UTC)There's no way to "make fonts" on Wikipedia. I'm not sure what is meant by that. Leebo T/C 21:51, 28 September 2007 (UTC)Exactly. Hence my confusion as well. --Bfigura (talk) 21:59, 28 September 2007 (UTC)See Wikipedia:How to edit a page#Character formatting and Help:HTML in wikitext#Span. PrimeHunter 23:49, 28 September 2007 (UTC)The cheatsheet is supposed to be a quick guide for stuff you would come across in daily editing. Templates and font alterations are a bit more advanced. Not that you shouldn't try them, but it does make sense not to include hard stuff on a page that is supposed to make things easy. - Mgm|(talk) 14:13, 29 September 2007 (UTC)It seems that your threat to get mad paid off handsomely - just look at all those responses. Before reaching the obvious conclusion about how to phrase future requests for help, see: WP:DICK. Getting to your question, how come the cheatsheet doesn't list something or other, that's because Wikipedia is whatever users like you and me decide to make it. If you want to write another cheatsheet for template editing, be bold and write it. But first, check out this really huge cheatsheet, the Editor's index. On the Editor's index you can find almost everything there is to know about editing on Wikipedia. --Teratornis 18:38, 29 September 2007 (UTC)[edit] How do you design a usernameExamples:Chris GKip SmithersBloodpackThanks Preceding unsigned comment added by Deadriene16 (talk  contribs) 21:50, 28 September 2007 (UTC)See Wikipedia:Signatures#Customizing your signature.
