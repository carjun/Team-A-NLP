(AP / Charlie Riedel)Updated:  Tue Jan. 11 2011 20:38:24CTV.ca News StaffThe family of the man accused of killing six people and injuring 14 others during a shooting rampage in Arizona expressed their condolences to the victims' families Tuesday. Jared Loughner is accused of firing into a crowd outside a Safeway store Saturday morning, an attack that killed a judge and critically wounded Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Loughner's family, who a neighbour described as being devastated by the accusations against their son, expressed sorrow over the rampage in a statement handed to reporters outside their home. "There are no words that can possibly express how we feel. We wish there were, so we could make you feel better," read the statement. "We don't understand why this happened. It may not make any difference, but we wish that we could change the heinous events of Saturday. We care very deeply about the victims and their families. We are so very sorry for their loss." Loughner, 22, faces five federal criminal counts in the shooting: the attempted assassination of a member of Congress; two counts of killing an employee of the federal government; and two counts of attempting to kill a federal employee. He appeared in a Phoenix court on Monday in which he acknowledged that he understood the charges he faced. ABC News reporter Diana Alvear said Loughner addressed the court calmly during his appearance. "At times he even appeared to smirk -- it was a little unsettling for many of the reporters who were present there," Alvear told CTV's Canada AM from Tucson Tuesday morning. Alvear said none of Loughner's family or friends was present for the hearing. About 600 people attended a memorial at the St. Odilia Catholic Church Tuesday for the victims of the shooting. On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama will travel to Arizona for a larger memorial, where he will deliver a message to the nation. "In Tucson, the President and the First Lady will attend the memorial event Together We Thrive: Tucson and America' at the University of Arizona to support and remember victims of the mass shooting in Tucson," the White House said in a statement. Giffords' condition improves Giffords, who was shot in the head at point blank range, is now breathing on her own according to her doctors, who updated reporters on her condition earlier Tuesday. Her neurosurgeon, Dr. Michael Lemole Jr., said Giffords is able "to generate her own breaths" but a breathing tube remains in place to protect her from complications such as pneumonia. "I'm happy to say that she's holding her own," Lemole said during a news conference Tuesday at University Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz. "Her status is the same as it was yesterday." Five other people remain hospitalized after the shooting rampage. Three of the victims are in serious condition and two in fair condition. Giffords, a 40-year-old, three-term Democrat, was rushed to hospital quickly after the shooting. Not long after, doctors treating her reported the congresswoman was conscious and responsive. She underwent two hours of surgery Sunday in which doctors removed debris from the gunshot and a small amount of dead brain tissue. They also removed nearly half of Giffords' skull to accommodate swelling, preserving the skull bone for later replanting. Giffords was being kept in a medically induced coma to give her brain time to rest. Doctors have since been able to ease her sedation, but said the timeline for her recovery remains uncertain. "This is the phase of the care where it's so much up to her," Lemole said. "She's going to take her recovery at her own pace," he said, adding that he's "very encouraged by the fact that she has done so well." Death penalty possible Federal prosecutors have not yet definitively said whether they will seek the death penalty in the case. Pima County Attorney Barbara LaWall said there are two factors that promote seeking execution: the death of a child and the fact that multiple victims died. LaWall said her office would handle all other charges against Loughner, including those related to the four people killed who were not federal employees and those who were wounded. Miami defence lawyer Neal Sonnett said the defence will have to push to dissuade federal prosecutors from pursuing the death penalty. "That's the task of his lawyer in the first instance," Sonnett told the Associated Press. Well-known Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz also predicted "the prosecution will seek the maximum punishment in a case like this." It will also be difficult for the defence to claim that Loughner could be innocent by reason of insanity. Congress raised the bar for insanity defences after John Hinckley shot former president Ronald Reagan in 1981. A jury later found Hinckley was innocent by reason of insanity. Amid public outrage, Congress shifted the burden of proof over insanity to the defence, among other changes to the law. Dershowitz said the rampage in Arizona "would be a clear case of insanity, because the pre-mediation would not be seen as undercutting insanity, it would be part of demonstrating insanity." But with the changes brought in after the Hinkley case, Dershowitz said "that's a very uphill battle." Arizona also has modified its expectations for the insanity defence over the years. Pima County Attorney LaWall said if a convicted person "is held at a state mental hospital, and if sanity somehow comes back, he's transferred to prison, not just let go." The team that represented Loughner in his Monday court appearance was led by Judy Clarke, a San Diego attorney who is a veteran of many high-profile death cases. Clarke previously defended "Unabomber" Theodore Kaczynski, serial bomber Eric Rudolph and Susan Smith, a mother who drowned her two young sons. All three of these individuals avoided execution. With files from The Associated Press Comments are now closed for this storyRonYou have to wonder what leads someone to shoot  a bunch of people. The problem in the U.S. is that once the person decides to do it they just have to look in the kitchen drawer for the gun and away they go.pdm in VictoriaWhile I, like most people, feel for the Congresswoman and her family, she was warned about threats and should have taken far more precaution.We are hearing nothing about the additional unlucky bystanders whom I understand are in critical condition. We are also not hearing much about the people who actually lost their their lives.This story has become about one upper class privileged white person who is receiving the best possible medical attention.At the same time 11 people were killed in a political shooting in the middle-east and that story has disappeared. Canada is becoming as obsessed by privilege as the US. I fee for the people who were in the wrong place and the families of those still suffering. Come on CTV report the whole story and not just one person.MargaretSorry but she deserves no more publicity than those injured or killed, especially the latter.  The Judges life and the little girl's life are equally important, for the other , tell that to the families of those deceased  He certainly  meant to kill the Congresswoman, but why the others. ?   Again if she wasnt  in the political  arena, would the death penalty be mentioned for the other victims, I doubt it.  No matter where in the world, when you enter political life, these are the chances you take. This is so USAiluvsaskPsychosis   the ability to buy a gun along with your Snickers bar spells trouble. Far more damning is a political celebrity's posting of a cross hair's map on the internet. All I have to say is shame on you Sarah Palin.  If you have a conscience you'll be carrying the weight of all the victims of this senseless tragedy.serge in HamiltonWhy are people able to buy a Glock 9 with a 30-round magazine? 31 Bullets if you have one chambered! Why do people need that, to defend themselves? If you can't smoot someone with 6 bullets I doubt you can hit them with 31!TheOtherLowellInBCBorpo, I have heard that argument so many times that it has no meaning for me anymore.   A gun is  used as a weapon or for hunting.   Ok 3 purposes.  there is target shooting also.  But the inventor of the gun created it for survival.  To collect food and for personal defense.   Guns are primarily associated with killing and maiming.ouifygThis is obviously just a case of some gun-toting crazy going off on a random shooting spree.  It has nothing to do with the political atmosphere in the U.S.  How else could you explain the shooting of a member of congress AND a federal judge in the same incident?If people would step back and actually listen to what is being said about this instead of immediately jumping into their usual partisan agendas they would notice that nobody (or nobody credible at least) is blaming the right or the left for this tragedy.  What is being blamed is the overall extreme tone of political debate.  And rightly so!Ken SSo, Borpo, an obvious step is to take guns out of the hand of the person in the street.  I would hate to be a traffic cop in Arizona, knowing that every speeder could be armed to the teeth as well as being ticked off fro being stopped on his/her way home from the honky-tonk.AnneAnd yet, one cannot commit someone into psychiatric care against their will because it is against their freedom under the Charter (in Canada, I'm sure it's the same in the States) - even if they are displaying unstable and dangerous behaviour. Not until they DO something to someone the police etc say, their hands are tied. We have everything backwards and then wonder why these horrific things happen.Laurna TallmanPsychosis is caused by audio-processing deficits that are the result of the inability of the stapedius muscle in the right middle ear to convey enough sound energy to the left brain to keep it dominant. I have written a book, a monograph, and a report on the damaging effects of SSRIs to the ear that support this paradigm of mental illness. Middle ear damage frequently can be healed by exposure to high-frequency sound, via the Tomatis Method or Berard's AIT adaptation of it, or with ordinary CDs of violin music and headphones that ended more than one episode of severe schizophrenia in my son. He knows now how to care for his ears so that he can remain free of  symptoms of psychosis. Loughner's smirking that people find disturbing is the result of his left hemisphere losing its control over the muscles in his face at intervals, probably about two minutes apart. My blog explains the paradigm in more detail and my writing explains the neurological and behavioural science not only of severe mental illness but the entire spectrum of human behaviour including the ear's function in the range of normal. Mental illness does not begin in the brain, it begins in a damaged ear, or ears. While social factors can exacerbate the dangers in someone already unstable, they do not cause the mental illness. A short list of assaults on the ear that can lead to mental illness include viral and other infections, chemicals including many medications, loud sound, low frequency sound, physical trauma such as auto and sporting accidents, hormonal problems, and congenital deformities of the middle and inner ear.lcTrying to link cause effect to political media and this tragedy is a stretch. Spending billions of tax payer money on war based on a pack of lies ,that is cause effect. Up and maybe more a million dead Iraqis, that is cause effect. Ever changing mission statement in Afghanistan to enable the illegal occupation to continue, that is cause effect. Using tax payer money to support the drug dealer ruling Afghanistan, that is cause effect. Just wish those getting their knickers in a knot would show a fraction of the passion for those crimes instead of a mentally ill lone individual!John from TorontoGuns kill people - otherwise they wouldn't make guns.  Lets not forget, only one out of a hundred law abiding gun owners goes crazy and shoots the other 99.MikeDeepest condolences and heartfelt sympathies to all of the victims families. Best wishes for speedy recoveries to ALL of the injured. Are we going to see front page news daily documenting Giffords' recovery? Gifford eats solid food, etc... I wish her well, as I do all of the victims, but I honestly don't think it needs to be a daily headline here in Canada. If this had happened here in Canada the US news networks would have given the story 2 possibly 3 minutes of coverage. Surely there must be something happening in Canada that's more relevant to Canadians and worthy of the front page space of a Canadian news source. This is just another right wing gun nut that lost his nut, a good example of what we don't want in Canada.BorpoGuns don't kill people, people with guns kill people.Questions?Richard in New BrunswickI worked for many years in social work and have dealt with dozens of clearly and obviously unbalanced, mentally ill individuals who were mostly left to their own devices to deal with society as best they could. There was neither enough resources nor the right resource to attend to their needs. Hospitals simply don't want anyone who isn't actually bleeding and proper facilities for the mentally ill are few and far between. Even where they exist they are almost always full with huge waiting lists. People having an acute psychological episode need IMMEDIATE and EFFECTIVE assistance. Putting them on a waiting list is asking for trouble... which we usually get. It has always confounded me that unlimited resources are always found to deal with incidents AFTER THE FACT but never enough to prevent them. Obviously not all the mental difficulties are exclusively resting with the "clients."Doug # BCOMG.It's hard to imagine the mind set of someone who is sick and tired of hearing about the Congress woman.No one is saying she is more "important" than anyone else.But at this time,I think she is the only one hanging on by a thread.She can be helped.Those who died will be mourned.Offering our best wishes for this a woman who served her country in a more visible and perhaps more dangerous way,is NOT an inappropriate thing to do.If she gets more news coverage than the others,it is only because she is still at risk,can be saved,and has a bigger resume in the public arena than the other victims of this tragedy.How you spin that into a story about how the media thinks that her life is any more "important" than the opther victims is exactly the kind of spin and rherotic that drives people to comit these henous crimes.  I am not quick to dismiss the influence of highly charged politcal rhetoric on many people in our society.It's never helpful to use exageration or hate to further a political cause.But to suggest it's an entirely "right wing" idea,is beyond the bounds of absurd.In case no one noticed,it was the "left wing" who razed the city of Toronto during the G20.It was the left wing who tried to raze Vancouver during the Olympics.It's almost always left wing groups that are the destructive participants at demonstartions.And it's the extreme left special interst groups who can never accept "no" as an answer to some of their outrageous demands.    Extremists are a problem.But to suggest they are all right wing,neo conservatives is a pretty bad joke.Prof. Pye CharttPathetic was the hyperactive media's attempt to pin the tragedy on the "tone of political debate" in America, and rest responsibility for the murders at the feet of Tea Party, Republican, conservative, and all "right-wing" folks -- including, of course, Sarah Palin -- when the FACTS surrounding the young mentally ill suspect's political convictions didn't/don't point in that direction.  (Did it ever dawn on ANYONE in the media, or any of the yapping, finger-pointing lefties, that it was entirely hypocritical to condemn "inflammatory rhetoric" while heaping blame for the lethal violence on politically passionate members of the law-abiding public who had nothing to do with the actions of a mentally unstable person who did not even formally belong to their flock?)  Now, forced to distance itself from that irresponsible angle, the media finds it appropriate and "informative" (in order to keep the over-the-top coverage rolling) to tell us how the alleged murderer's parents feel about the whole thing.  Gee, thanks.  Keep up the good work, folks.d_abes in SaskatoonGifford is THE story because a) She was the orgininal "primary" target.  b) She has the celebrity c) the very fact she survived (so far) a point black shot to the head.  We shouldn't be surprised she's the primary focus, especially considering the tantalizing factor of a political assassination.  Frankly if it was a family member of mine who was one of the unknown victims, I would be relieved and prefer it to stay that way.TheOtherLowellinBCMargaret, I think when you threaten or take the life of a member of congress,  or any other legislative body there is a stiffer penalty.   Members of Congress in particular do not have any special protection assigned to them so when they go into public domain which they do alot,  they expose themselves to these kinds of situations.  Plus Gifford was such an unlikely candidate for this.  She was always conciliatory in her approach and not devisive,  a very kind hearted person and it seems so strange anyone would have an ax to grind against her.   Gifford by the way was the target for the shooter so that is probably why the media are so focussed on her recovery process.rogerI think we as a society have to be more aware of people who act unbalanced and who start talking about killing society. I have to admit I have a son if he starting acting out in the fashion I would do everything in my power to have him comitted. I also think agencies also have to start taking this threats seriously and not brush it a side.TheOtherLowellinBCShannon,  there has been lots of news on the 9 year old girl, the judge and the aide to Gifford.  Granted not as much known about the other injured.   As far as tea party comments.  It is a known fact that a number of folks on the republican/tea party side during the recent elections whipped up a frenzy with their gun metaphors.   If you have folks walking around that are mentally unbalanced,  this could reinforce their thoughts and behaviors.  Its pretty hard to prove a causal and effect relationship however,   politicians should not even bother to use this language.   The gun culture is prevalent enough in american society.  No need to make it more enduringMargaretI totally agree with Shannon. I am also fed up  hearing about the condition of the Congresswoman , its obvious wth the media the other victims dont matter. There are 2 people dead, does that not matter. The Feds are seeking the death penalty, would this still be the case if the congresswoman wasnt a victim .???ShannonI am so tired of everything about this tragic event focusing on Gifford.  SIX people are DEAD,  Including a nine year old girl!!!  THIRTEEN people are injured, not just Gifford.  The media barely mentions all the other victims in passing, more of an after-thought.  Is the life of this lady of any more value than the six people who were lost entirely?  Is she more valuable than the 12 other injured?  BC of her job should we care more about her than everyone else suffering???Paul ~ KitchenerMy prayer is to the families of the victims, & God will see this also come to pass. The horror felt, and seen in this tragedy, will be compounded and kept alive for months by the media. All forms of media are like hyennas on a feeding frenzy. There needs to be a time of recovery, reflection, & social justice & this can not be accomplished with News Media in the face of everyone that lives in Tuczon. Hundreds of panel experts, (in what I ask), will jam the T.V. screens, and tell us all what we don't need to be told.Lets cool the playing field, and let rehtoric calm down, so that calm may return to a devastating horror event.SHALOM !Whither CanadaThe swiftness with which Jared Lee Loughner's mass murder was blamed on the Tea Party Right was deeply revealing. Loughner registered as an independent voter in Arizona to vote on Sept. 29, 2006, identifying himself as an independent. Records show he voted in the 2006 and 2008 elections but is current listed as "inactive" on the state's voter roles -- meaning that he did not vote in November. The political affiliations of Loughner, charged with the shooting of Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords as well as 19 other victims have become the subject of a white-hot partisan debate. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, liberals sought to paint Loughner as an anti-government, tea party conservative. Conservatives retorted that Loughner lacked anything close to a coherent political philosophy -- a case strengthened by subsequent glimpses into his personal life that suggests someone struggling with mental illness. Loughner's decision to affiliate as an independent rather than a Republican or Democrat would seem to affirm the sense that while he targeted Giffords in the attack, it was not a decision born of a set of deeply held political beliefs that fit neatly into either party.If you have any questions or comments about this story click here.
