Col.: Loughner Cried "You're Hurting Me!"     (CBS)  TUSCON -- Debbie Scheidemantel got to know Jared Loughner when he was a student in her biology class at Tucson's Pima Community College last summer.The adjunct professor says she once had to call police and have Loughner removed from her class. Scheidemantel shared her story exclusively on "The Early Show" with co-anchor Erica Hill. Scheidemantel said on September 23, Loughner was "very destructive" in class. Special Section: Tragedy in TucsonGallery: Tuscon Shooting VictimsShe explained, "I was collecting papers that were due at the beginning of class. A different student had realized he forgot his paper and asked if he could turn it in late, and I said he could, but it would be half-credit. Then Jared realized that he didn't have his assignment. He raised his hand, and asked if he could turn it in late. And I said, yes, but for half-credit. At that point, he was upset, he said, 'No, I want full credit.' And I said, 'No, it's half-credit, it's part of the policy, it's spelled out in the syllabus.'Jared Loughner Had 5 Run-ins with College Police"Students understand this," Scheidemantel said. "But he didn't seem to, and he pointed at the flag, and the Constitution up at the front of the room and said that I was taking away his freedom of speech, I was taking away his individual rights, that it was unconstitutional. He was saying that, you know, he's paying me, and therefore I'm taking away his freedom of speech if I don't give him full credit. Well, I did calm him down. And I told him, you know, at that point, we couldn't resolve it real quick, so I said, you know, talk to me at the break. And he seemed to calm down. And class started."But Loughner's disruptive behavior, Scheidemantel said, didn't end there. "Class started and, five minutes later, he raised his hand. I guess he got the idea. He asked, 'Could I go to the library and do the assignment and come back before class is over and turn it in for full credit?' And I said, 'No, that it would be half-credit, because it was due at the beginning.' And again, he started his rant about the Constitution, pointing to the flag, pointing to the Constitution up at the front of the room, and at that point, he wouldn't stop, so I asked the students to be calm and wait, and at that point I went to the next room, and alerted my lab staff that there was a situation, and I called 911."Hill asked, "Were you fearful for your safety or for the safety of your other students at that point? Did he seem that he was violent in any way?"Scheidemantel answered, "He was not violent in any way, and he did not threaten anyone directly. But I did feel uneasy. I know the students were feeling uneasy. And so we called 911, and two officers came out. They removed him from the room and talked to him for awhile, and then one of the officers came to talk to me."Scheidemantel said the school and police backed her up appropriately. "Pima, I have to commend them. Backed me up and was right there. One officer talked to him for about a half-hour outside the classroom, and I think they realized that he was not thinking rationally, and the other officer mentioned something about maybe special ed or whatever. I didn't know, I had no indication if just was in a special program or something like that."That was the last Scheidemantel heard of Loughner -- until Saturday.Hill said, "You're watching coverage of this event, and as I understand, you heard that the alleged shooter was 22, that's it -- just the age of the alleged shooter."Scheidemantel said, "His name and picture immediately came to my mind. And then they gave the name, and I recognized the name, of course, and a little bit later in the newscast, they were showing the YouTube videos, and especially the one that had the black background with the writing on it. As I was reading it on the TV, I recognized the syntax and the unique way of writing and the convoluted illogic logic that he used to make his points." Loughner, who's been described as a social outcast with wild beliefs steeped in mistrust, faces a federal court hearing Monday on charges he tried to assassinate Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona and killed others in the Tucson shooting rampage on Saturday.    MMXI, CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

It is clear he had issues of mental stability. A thorough background check instead of an instant check could have uncovered this problem behavior, and perhaps prevented the sale of a 9mm handgun to him. A good case can be made for strickter control and licensing of handguns in Arizona. Without concrete measures of handgun control (as against hunting rifles), all this debate is so much hot air!     Reply to this comment            by lg144 January 12, 2011 3:37 AM EST  The country continues to go down the the drain as republicans continue siphoning money and resources away from average americans directing it to the wealthy and big corporations. Money that could help the mentally unbalanced before they act out. However, republicans do not believe in health care or helping average americans only the wealthy and big corporations. Any average american who elected republicans are part of the problem also.     Reply to this comment           by Sid235 January 14, 2011 4:02 PM EST  I agree. Republicans who oppose health care for all are part of the problem. I don't know what kind of insurance coverage Jared Loughner had. But early detection and treatment of his mental problems- as well as stricter handgun control - would most probably have prevented the Arizona massacre.                         by Tusec January 11, 2011 10:29 PM EST  Flag burners like Loughner are always ready to rant about their first amendment rights. So this isn't unexpected.Loughner is an atheist 9/11 Truther pothead who believed Bush's wars violated international law. Not exactly the Tea Party profile, you might say. In fact, there are other profiles that are a much better fit.     Reply to this comment           by DavidB2009 January 12, 2011 12:56 AM EST  what profile is that? lets see...he also hates government, specially the current government, is gun-crazy and shot a democratic representative...so what say you?                      by prometheus77 January 12, 2011 1:04 AM EST  Actually, I don't even follow what the Tea Party is doing, but I' pretty damn positive that I've seen Tea Party types waving Confederate flags and CONSTANTLY refer to their first amendment rights. They are VERY STEEPED in distrust of the government. And I know I've seen libertarian flag burners. And many libertarians who are potheads -- in fact they are driving influence being decriminalization of marijuana. And definitely many people across the spectrum who have doubts about 9/11 -- it's been ten years and the federal government can't even put enough evidence together to convict anybody for direct involvement. Bush's wars DID violate international law -- that is a FACT based on reality, U.N. doctrine and U.N. Security Council REFUSAL to even consider any argument yet alone allow a pre-emptive strike on a sovereign nation, particularly while the U.N. still had inspectors on the ground in Iraq looking for weapons of mass destruction as claimed. I think you're confusing a lack of due process to prosecute as being the same as not guilty of violating international law. These are not the same.So this isn't really a belief, but a fact. But anyway, I'm not even sure where you heard Loughner's opinions on that, but rule of law is kind of a big thing for a lot of people across the political spectrum.With regard to being an atheist, I also had no freaking idea that there weren't any atheists in the Tea Party, and I'm quite sure there are some.So you're fantasy about Loughner not fitting the Tea Party profile isn't actually REAL based on what you're saying. And you really need to refrain from assuming that certain opinions and expressions -- like flag burning -- always represent the same or even remotely related idealogical point of view to different people.But if you include a lot of the other known details about Loughner like his concerns about currency not being backed by gold, distrust of government in general, and depending on which report you believe, being registered as either a Republican or an Independent -- the vast majority of these have been Tea Party advocates, I mean that was their driving message during the 2008 election -- but never a Democrat, in past elections. And then you have statements like "I can't trust the current government because of fabrications. The government is implying mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling grammar.", which are not actually rambling as it turns out, but ideology from right-wing conspiracy buffs.It's actually IMPOSSIBLE to not create a Tea Party and/or right-wing libertarian profile from all of this                         by LIBERALS-lie January 11, 2011 7:59 PM EST  Did the "system work" ?I work in education and I see "potentially dangerous" people daily, yet nothing is done about them. Nobody wants to step in and deal with it. Everything is minimized and pushed away or swept under the carpet.     Reply to this comment           by Danielmountain January 12, 2011 3:58 AM EST  Other societies do allow such things -- for people to report on each other in such way -- and those societies gradually turn into dictatorships.                         by desertdwellr January 11, 2011 7:12 PM EST  I hope the college, this professor and the police act to use this incident as a learning tool and possibly implement some kind of program that get these types of individuals checked out by a mental health clinic or doctor when they have an episode like this. The answer was to just kick him out and everyone went about buisness as usual? Thats like sweeping dirt under a rug and calling the place clean.     Reply to this comment            by illcountryboy January 11, 2011 3:22 PM EST  This allegedly part irritates the heck out of me. I know the rules - I wrote for newspapers - but this CYA 'allegedly' kills me when that many people saw him commit the act. Allegedly means we aren't certain he did it.     Reply to this comment           by Saint_Frankenstein January 11, 2011 11:31 PM EST  He hasn't been convicted of anything yet so we must give him the benefit of the doubt by saying 'allegedly'. If we all of a sudden start branding people as guilty because of news reports without giving them a fair trial in a court of law...well, what would our nation have come to?                      by Danielmountain January 12, 2011 3:59 AM EST  No, Saint_Frankenstein, he's right. The news stations overuse the word "allegedly".Even long after a person has been convicted and imprisoned -- they could be talking about a story that happend ten, twenty years ago -- there's a stubborn insistence on their use of the word "allegedy".                         by Jellomonster31 January 11, 2011 2:50 PM EST  Now c'mon. Let's be serious about this gun issue: You think banning the sale of guns, the trade of guns, or the possession of guns is going to keep guns out of criminal or psychotic hands? You really believe we need to create a law, and spend the money attempting to enforce the law, that guns are banned in the U.S.A? Two quick things come to mind: Drugs and prostitution...wait, a third just popped in: Prohibition era alcohol. People, I'm no fan of guns myself (although I admit I'm not a gun hater either), but I see the simple truth about this "panic reaction" of "gun control". People kill people (over-used I know *sigh) and guns are just the easiest current way for a person to kill another person. Let's imagine you find a bottle on the beach, rub it, a genie appears and you wish that all guns on the whole planet vanished...poof! Now what? If you really fancy yourself a "thinker", convince me you really believe that scenario will put an end to violent crime...? People will be stabbing people or slashing with machetes so they can still commit mass murder. Ok? Let's ban knives and blades and eat steak in sandwiches. Good idea. Oh crap wait! Now some angry psycho just beat 7 preschoolers with a lead pipe. Damn, ban pipes. Oy! A jilted lover just bashed his girlfriends head in with a large stone. Well, it's obvious what we must do...ban all rocks. SOB! Some guy just strangled his boss. Well, we need to cut the hands off of all babies born in the U.S. (Tongue out of cheek now): There is no way to avoid violent crime. Even without guns someone who wants to hurt a lot of people will do so with little more than a wine bottle full of gasoline and a rag stuffed in it. Spending the money, passing the laws, spending the money, enforcing the laws to ban guns is a losing battle we should not engage in. Murder has existed since man has existed. Long long before guns existed. If you are pro-gun-ban, your solution is nothing but another problem. My solution you ask? My solution is no solution. Murder will happen. It always has, in every culture, every age, every climate, with every type weapon, against every kind of person. Let's not impose more "laws" as if they will "solve" the human condition. Sad but true people, sad but true.

If not, check out any Tea Freak rally.

Or could it be this woman just wanted to make her interview more interesting.

I've spent a lot of time in Arizona in the past years and those people have serious mental issues, they're hateful to everybody including each other, the act like they have a chip on their shoulders at all time, they're mean spirited, they're always angry, the last week I spent in Prescott I'm not sure I ever saw person smile.
