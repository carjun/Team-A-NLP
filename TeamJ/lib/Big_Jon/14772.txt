According to www.abs-cbnnews.com and quote " MANILA, Philippines (5th UPDATE) - At least 1.6 million Catholics joined a religious procession on Sunday for a centuries-old black icon of Jesus Christ believed by many to have miraculous powers. The annual parade of the Black Nazarene atop a gilded carriage around Manila's downtown Quiapo district is one of the largely Catholic country's most spectacular and extreme shows of faith, and attracts people from all walks of life. The carriage was pulled along in a sea of devotees, with thousands scrambling to get near the statue or touch the ropes as the image slowly made its way through busy roads.  Around 560 people were injured in the crush, according to the Red Cross." Over the years, faithful devotees, threw towels and handkerchief at the people who are on the top of the carriage, they are the ones who are making sure that the Black Nazarene would not fall down the carriage. This kind of possiblity could happen due to the fact that these faithful devotees would make sure that they can get near the Black Nazarene, so people who are far from the carriage tends to push the person in front and then it would create a chain effect and the people who are near the carriage have the possiblity to push the carriage itself. However, members of the influential, Catholic Bishops Conferences of the Philippines or the CBCP, said that the faithful devotees should not take their devotion to the statue to the extreme, for the image is just a mere representation of the real miracles of God. The Procession started around 7:70 AM and Ended at almost 11:30 PM. Almost 16 hours of procession. At around 7:30 AM nearly 1.2 million people have joined the procession. Then at 8:30 PM the procession was still going on when it rained lightly, but devotees did not mind the said rain fall and even considred the rain as "Blessing" To somehow give you an idea on how long the procession was here is the route as written at the website of the abs-cbnnews and quote: "The procession's route is as follows:  Quirino Grandstand Katigbak Drive thru Padre Burgos Taft Avenue thru McArthur Bridge Palanca St. thru (under) Quezon Bridge Quezon Blvd. Arlegui Fraternal Vergara Duque de Alba Castillejos Farnecio Arlegui Nepomuceno Aguila Carcer Hidalgo thru Plaza Del Carmen Bilibid Viejo thru Puyat St. Guzman Hidalgo Barbosa Globo de Oro thru (under) Quezon Bridge Palanca Villalobos thru Plaza Miranda Quiapo Church  The Manila Police Department deployed about 1,600 police officers to maintain peace and order during the procession. It added that said that aside from policemen on the field, it is monitoring the procession through CCTV cameras that are strategically installed around the capital city. Last year, 197 people were hurt while one devotee died due to a heart attack. There are 23 medical stations along the procession route and 18 ambulances are on standby."  Also according to ABS-CBN News Update, after 16 hours of procession finally the carriage of the Black Nazarene have already reached the Quiapo Church. The Carriage arrived at 11:30PM where there were also a lot of faitful devotess waiting inside the church to welcome the Black Nazarene. This has been a Filipino Tradition which dates at 1787, that would not fade, as long as the faith of the person is alive and burning, everyday would always be a miracle. Even in small things miracles do happen. For allvoices this has been Odessa Benaning.
