Many of us laughed or scoffed (I know I did) at his brazen bravado and at his blatant misogyny. But hey, its a Rap song and a Rap artist. What did you expect?! And besides, it truly was ludicrous! What man would possibly, or could possibly, have girlfriends all over the nation whom he dials up for booty calls. I mean, one or two I can fathom, but all over the nation?!     [chorus] I've got hoes I've got hoes, in different area codes (area, area codes) hoes, hoes,hooooes in different area codes (area, area codes)   Well, it turns out that such a man does exist, and hes not a rap artist or a pimp or a deviant (unless we tag him with the title of sexual deviant). Hes a golfer, of all things! And his name is Tiger WoodsTiger Woods. Until barely a week ago, Tiger Woods was the poster child for hard work and perseverance. A private man, one to emulate.   In fact, the January 2010 edition of Golf Digest magazine has an imaginative cover portraying President Obama lining up a putt while Tiger Woods whispers advice in his ear. The article goes on to praise Woods as a good role model because he has always been able to pull himself together after setbacks. Role model? Really? Adding: Tiger never does anything that would make him ridiculous. No, not ridiculous -just Ludacris!   [Ludacris] Now you thought I was just 7-7-0 And 4-0-4, I'm worldwide biotch, act like yall don't know It's the abominable "ho" man Globe-trot international post man Neighbor-d___ dope man 7-1-8s, 2-0-2's I send small cities and states I-O-U's 9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5 I'll jump off the g-4, we can meet outside So control your hormones and keep your drawers on 'Til I close the door and I'm jumping your bones 3-1-2, 3-1-3, 2-1-5, 8-0-3 Read your hor-oscope and eat some hor-derves Ten I pump one these hoes is self serve 7-5-7, 4-1-0, my cell phone just overloads   Oh man! Wouldnt you just love to get your hands on Tigers cell phone and check out how many girls he has and in just how many different area codes they reside? Heck, Id settle for a peek in his iPod. I bet you he has Area Codes in it. He must have chuckled to himself every time he listened to it.   But really, can you imagine Tiger Woods whipping his Escalade, pumping his fist like a Jersey boy to   [Ludacris] Now everyday is a ho-ly-day So stop the violence and put the 4-4 away, keeps you to hold today 5-0-4, 9-7-2 7-1-3, whatcha gon do You checkin up the scene, I'm checkin a ho tonight With perpendicular vehicular homicide 3-1-4, 2-0-1 Too much green, too much fun   So far, the young ladies that have come forward, or have been pushed forward, reside in numerous area codes.   1. Rachel Uchitel. NY, NY Area Code (646, 718) 2. Jamie Grubbs. Los Angeles CA Area Code (310, 323, 626, 818) 3. Kalika Moquin. Las Vegas, NV Area Code (775) 4. Cori Rist. NY, NY Area Code (646, 718) 5. Jamie Jungers. Las Vegas NV Area Code (775) 6. Mindy Lawton. Orlando, FL Area Code (407 689, 3217)  7. Holly Sampson. Los Angeles, CA Area Code (310, 323, 626, 818) 8. Unidentified Orlando, Fla. Area Code (407 689, 3217)   Alleged Mistress No. 8   And heres how Tiger Woods outdoes even Ludacris - Hes international!   9. Unidentified Great Britain Area Code (44)  Alleged Mistress No. 9   10. Unidentified Great Britain Area Code (44)  Alleged Mistress No. 10.   [Ludacris] 9-1-6, 4-1-5, 7-0-4 Shout out to the 2-0-6 Everybody in the 8-0-8 2-1-6, 7-0-2, 4-1-4 3-1-7, 2-1-4s and the 2-8-1s 3-3-4, 2-0-5, I see ya'll...   Ho's in different area codes   ShakespeareShakespeare once wrote (and I take great liberties at quoting his lines):   So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Shall in the general censure take corruption To his own scandal.   And so it is with Woods. A man otherwise blessed from on high, dragged down below by one major flaw. A man destined for fame, now slotted for infamy. A man whos praises we should sing, now merely a footnote to an otherwise poor rap song  a joke!    I stroke so good like Tiger Woods and I roar like a tiger would. -Ludacris   Pathetic! Tune in next time when I will be analyzing Tiger's fascination with another one of Ludacris' songs, "What's Your Fant-tasy?" Here's a small sampling: I wanna li li li lick you from your head to your toes and I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor and I wanna ah ah you make it so good I don't wanna leave but I got to let let me know wh what's your fant-tasy... ...in the sun or up in the shade on the top of my Escalade  Yuck! Someone ought to dust the hood for hiny prints!              1 of 2         Who's whispering advice in Tiger's ear?      romerooremor is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America,and is Stringer for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (74.1%) Egypt (22.2%) Senegal (3.7%)           READ MORE: Holly Sampson, Ludacris, Mindy Lawton, different area, rap artist, alleged mistress, entertainment-news, William Shakespeare, Rachel Uchitel, Yi script, Jamie Grubbs, Obama, Cori Rist, Tiger Woods, Jamie Jungers   More News From: Philadelphia :  PA :  USA     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 28            Reply  Posted By     Adrian Holman|about 1 yearagoEverything that is done in the dark is brought to the light.
