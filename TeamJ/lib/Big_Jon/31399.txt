[emphasis added  FMP]"There would be torture and then an ear necklace, with [Minnesota US Rep.] Michelle Bachmann and Sarah Palin's ears toward the end, because they're small, female ears, and then Limbaugh, Hannity and the biggest ears of all, Cheney's, in the center," Fuller said.Also on Friday, Fuller stopped by the home of gunman Jared Lee Loughner and told a neighbor he was going to forgive the shooter, The Associated Press said.On Saturday, Fuller was carted away for a psychiatric exam after disrupting the town-hall meeting by taking a photo of Tucson Tea Party co-founder Trent Humphries and shouting, "You're dead!"Absolutely bizarre. Fuller forgives Loughner for shooting him, but wants to torture and disfigure Republicans for the crime of disagreeing with Democrats. It's the Left's new civility! It remains to be seen whether Fuller will be the keynote speaker at the DNC this year, or given a place of honor at President Obama's State of the Union speech.Posted byFull Metal Patriotat9:54 AM0commentsLinks to this postEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Google BuzzLabels:Democrats,hypocrisy,insanity,intolerance,liberalsMidweek Peek: Nicole MinettiToday's Rule 5 babe is Nicole Minetti, former dental hygienist and local Italian politician at the center of a sex scandal involving Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

What is "offensive" about George Washington? Via Brutally Honest: (h/t: Chicks On The Right)The information that I have received from someone who was there at the South Carolina King day celebration/protest, is that the statue of George Washington was covered up, "so as not to offend anyone" attending the King day celebration on the state house steps. [emphasis added  FMP] I spent most of the afternoon and evening trying to locate media photographs of today's events, having been previously informed of the incident in a Facebook posting. "The State" newspaper in Columbia SC is the only media outlet that can presently be located on the internet, that even noted the covering of the statue or mentioned it, or published photographs of the incident for that matter. The bottom line, A statue of the father of this nation is boxed up and draped in black, so as not to offend people? At a celebration commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.? At a protest rally sponsored by the NAACP? And no one in national media notices or questions why? And no one in media (save one local newspaper) takes any notice or exception to it? ---RELATED: Atlas Shrugs offers a quote from Ayn Rand which gives a possible explanation for the NAACP's overzealous censorship.In its great era of capitalism, the United States was the freest country on earthand the best refutation of racist theories. Men of all races came here, some from obscure, culturally undistinguished countries, and accomplished feats of productive ability which would have remained stillborn in their control-ridden native lands. Men of racial groups that had been slaughtering one another for centuries, learned to live together in harmony and peaceful cooperation. America had been called the melting pot, with good reason. But few people realized that America did not melt men into the gray conformity of a collective: she united them by means of protecting their right to individualityToday, that problem is growing worseand so is every other form of racism. America has become race-conscious in a manner reminiscent of the worst days in the most backward countries of nineteenth-century Europe. The cause is the same: the growth of collectivism and statism.---UPDATE: Since their "we didn't want to offend anyone" excuse didn't fly, the NAACP is trying a different damage control tactic.The S.C. NAACP said Tuesday it was not trying to hide a State House statue of George Washington at its annual Martin Luther King Day rally Monday.The group has draped the founding fathers statue at previous rallies. It did so again this year and questions quickly arose about whether Washington somehow was being slighted.Not so, says the NAACP.A three-sided structure that covered the front and sides of the statue was intended to display a rally graphic and serve as a backdrop for the events speakers, said S.C. NAACP executive director Dwight James. However, the graphic was not finished before the rally and could not be put in place.Photos of the event showed a three-sided box with the founding fathers statue visible only from behind the stage.What we had constructed was a background with a graphic to be placed on it, James said. We werent trying to obstruct anything.King Day organizers have built similar structures around the statue dating back to at least 2007, according to State newspaper archives.Most State House rallies use the statue as an unobstructed backdrop, including Saturdays Stand Up for Life March and Rally.Yeah, ok, the graphic for the box wasn't finished. There was a graphic on the podium, though. Today's lame excuse only proves that the NAACP has had a problem with George Washington's statue being visible at any King Day event since 2007.---RELATED: Via Lloyd Marcus, "Proud Unhyphenated American" at American ThinkerThis misdirected ridiculous behavior by the NAACP epitomizes why I, a black American, will never join or give one nickel to this exploitative divisive organization. With black high school dropout rates at epidemic levels, 80% of black kids growing up in fatherless homes and 50% of black pregnancies ending in abortion, why on earth would the NAACP invest time and energy into running around covering up statues of long dead white guys; rather than addressing "real" issues plaguing black America today?Regardless of what you think about George Washington, he was our first president. Exploiting the occasion of MLK day to diss America's first president is part of the NAACP's continuing effort to find irrelevant crap to protest about, impugn the greatness of our country and live in the past, as if American race relations have not progressed since the 50s.

At 31 ounces, it holds more than the human stomach.Starbucks Corp will roll out its biggest drink size yet  the 31-ounce Trenta  in all of its U.S. coffee shops by May 3, the company said SundayThe new size will be available only for iced coffee, iced tea and iced tea lemonade drinks in the United States. The Trenta is 7 ounces larger than Starbucks Venti cup for iced drinks, which currently is its largest size on offer.Drinks in the Trenta size will cost 50 cents more than similar Venti-sized iced drinks, the company said.Seattle-based Starbucks tested the new size in several U.S. markets last year, saying it was responding to customer demand for larger cold beverages.I'm not so much concerned with how much the human stomach can hold. I'd be more concerned with the fact that the human bladder only holds about 16 ounces at a time, and the urge to pee comes when you hit the 5-6 ounce mark.

Youre already objecting to my letter. You dont like the label statist. You dont think of yourselves as worshipping government; rather, you think of yourselves as simply wanting to help people, with government being your preferred means to achieve what is usually a very worthy end. Statist, you say, is a loaded terma pejorative that suggests an over-the-top affinity for the state.Well, lets wait and see how the term stacks up after youve read my whole letter and answered its questions. Meantime, if you have any doubt about whether this missive is directed at you, let me clarify to whom I am writing. If youre among those many people who spend most of their time and energy advocating a litany of proposals for expanded government action, and little or no time recommending offsetting reductions in state power, then this letter has indeed found its mark.You clever guys are always coming up with new schemes for government to do this or that, to address this issue or solve that problem, or fill some need somewhere. You get us limited-government people bogged down in the minutiae of how your proposed programs are likely to work (or not work), and while were doing the technical homework you seldom do, you demonize us as heartless number crunchers who dont care about people.Sometimes we all get so caught up in the particulars that we ignore the big picture. I propose that we step back for a moment. Put aside your endless list of things for government to do and focus on the whole package. I need some thoughtful answers to some questions that maybe, just maybe, youve never thought much about because youve been too wrapped up in the program du jour.At the start of the 1900s, government at all levels in America claimed about 5 percent of personal income. A hundred years later, it takes something approaching 40 percentup by a factor of eight. So my first questions to you are these: Why is this not enough? How much do you want? Fifty percent? Seventy percent? Do you want all of it? To what extent do you believe a person is entitled to what he (or she) has earned?I want specifics. Like millions of Americans planning for their retirement or their childrens college education, I need to know. Ive already sacrificed a lot of plans to pay your bills, but if youre aiming for more, Im going to have to significantly curtail my charitable giving, my discretionary spending, my saving for a rainy day, my future vacations, and perhaps some other worthwhile things.I know what youre thinking: There you go again, you selfish character. Were concerned about all the peoples needs and youre only interested in your own bank account. But who is really focused on dollars and cents here, you or me?Why is it that if I disagree with your means, you almost always assume I oppose your ends? I want people to eat well, live long and healthy lives, get the prescription drugs and health care they need, etc., etc., just like you. But I happen to think there are more creative and voluntary ways to get the job done than robbing Peter to pay Paul through the force of government. Why dont you show some confidence in your fellow citizens and assume that they can solve problems without you?Were not ignorant and helpless, in spite of your many poorly performing government schools and our having to scrape by with a little more than half of what we earn. In fact, give us credit for managing to do some pretty amazing things even after you take your 40 percent cutthings like feeding and clothing and housing more people at higher levels than any socialized society has ever even dreamed of.This raises a whole series of related questions about how you see the nature of government and what youve learned, if anything, from our collective experiences with it. I see the ideal government as Americas founders didin Washingtons words, a dangerous servant employing legalized force for the purpose of preserving individual liberties. As such, it is charged with deterring violence and fraud and keeping itself small, limited, and efficient. How can you profess allegiance to peace and nonviolence and at the same time call for so much forcible redistribution?Dont invoke democracy, unless youre prepared to explain why mightin the form of superior numbersmakes right. Of course, I want the governed to have a big say in whatever government we have, but unlike you I have no illusions about any acts being a legitimate function of government if its political supporters are blessed by 50 percent plus one of those who bother to show up at the polls. Give me something deeper than that, or Ill round up a majority posse to come and rightfully claim whatever we want of yours. Why is it that you statists never seem to learn anything about government? You see almost any shortcoming in the marketplace as a reason for government to get bigger but you rarely see any shortcoming in government as a reason for it to get smaller. In fact, I wonder at times if you are honestly capable of identifying shortcomings of government at all! Do we really have to give you an encyclopedia of broken promises, failed programs, and wasted billions to get your attention? Do we have to recite all the workers paradises that never materialized, the flashy programs that fizzled, the problems government was supposed to solve but only managed into expensive perpetuity?Where, by the way, do you think wealth comes from in the first place? I know youre fond of collecting it and laundering it through bureaucraciesfeeding the sparrows through the horses as my grandfather once put itbut tell me honestly how you think it initially comes into being. Come on, now. You can say it: private initiative.Ive asked a lot of questions here, I know. But you have to understand that youre asking an awful lot more in blood, sweat, tears, and treasure from the rest of us every time you pile on more government without lightening any of the previous load. If anything Ive asked prompts you to rethink your premises and place some new restraints on the reach of the state, then maybe the statist label doesnt apply to you. In which case, you can look forward to devoting more of your energies to actually solving problems instead of just talking about them, and liberating people instead of enslaving them.Sincerely,Lawrence W.

And unfortunately, this ad from the The National Head Start Association is just as relevant today as when it ran in 1998:"Does this bother you? It should. We've spent over 400 years fighting for the right to have a voice. Is this how we'll use it? More importantly, is this how we'll teach our children to use it? If we expect more of them, we must not throw our hands in the air and agree with those who say our children cannot be taught. By now, you've probably heard about Ebonics (aka, black English). And if you think it's become a controversy because white America doesn't want us messing with their precious language, don't. White America couldn't care less what we do to segregate ourselves.The fact is language is power. And we can't take that power away from our children with Ebonics. Would Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and all the others who paid the price of obtaining our voice with the currency of their lives embrace this? If you haven't used your voice lately, consider this an invitation.""Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity." ~Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.If you haven't taken the time to listen to Dr. King's entire "Dream" speech, today is the perfect day to do so. ---RELATED: Heritage.org has an excellent post today, entitled "Frederick Douglasss Irrepressible Faith in America."

And even though Zamudio exhibited good judgment and didn't even need to use his firearm, and thus didn't shoot anyone (even Loughner), the Kossack diarist persists that Zamudio might have shot the wrong person, and suggests that private gun ownership is a bad thing because of what might happen.Another post claims "Republicans' health repeal would cut off expansion of mental health services," hinting that a repeal of Obamacare will create an explosion of Jared Loughners running rampant in society.The Left is still scaremongering and hurling vulgar tea-bagger invective even as they lecture the Right on civil discourse.  President Obama's call for civility sure didn't last long.For a few months new, I've heard from a Leftist fan of Jon Stewart who believes that if I post my thoughts about an issue, it's somehow harmful and therefore I should be quiet. Sorry, but that kind of liberal demagoguery doesn't fly with me.Like most people, I want to be able to have civil debate with those whose ideas differ from mine. What confounds me is that some people's ideas about "change" are not just different, they are absolutely incompatible with America as a free society. And I refuse to temper my opinions just because the Left now wants to tamp down dissent using so-called civility as their cudgel.How do we find common ground with people who still seem to only want to shout down their opponents, preferring to threaten and legislate them into silence?How do we find common ground with people intent on emulating the economic failures of Europe?How do we establish a civil dialogue with people who scorn our Founding Fathers and shun the essential constraints placed on our federal government by the U.S. Constitution?How can we cooperate with Americans who willfully embrace the doctrines of communism and socialism, in diametric opposition to the traditional American way of life?Why I should back down to those who want to subvert America and implement foreign styles of governance? Why won't those who want to follow another way of life go seek it out where it exists rather than attempt to force it on the American people? If you think Hugo Chavez has the right idea, go live in Venezuela and support his regime with your presence and your money. If you think Lenin and Marx were geniuses whose policies just haven't been given a fair chance, feel free to go experience how well they work for you in North Korea, China, or Cuba.Don't tell the Right that we need to "tone down" our rhetoric after the Left has spent a decade foaming at the mouth about President George W. Bush. Ten years of their Chimpy Hitler McHaliburton narrative set the tone for our current political climate.I will not tone down my rhetoric. We are at an impasse, and the stakes are nothing less than the preservation of America as a free nation.If you don't want bitter opposition, then don't try to change America's basic freedoms. It's pretty simple; don't act like America's enemies and you won't be treated like one.If you don't want me to angrily oppose Marxism, don't try to pass collectivist policies. If you don't want to hear me vigorously defend my Second Amendment rights, don't try to abridge them with more gun control laws and gun bans.If you don't want me to forcefully speak out against Obamacare, then don't ramrod the legislation through Congress despite the clear opposition of a majority of Americans.If you don't want strident dissent on abortion, don't use taxpayer dollars to fund them.If you don't want assertive opposition to rampant spending, don't raise the debt ceiling and continue the headlong rush into bankruptcy.If you don't want to hear me talk about the Constitution, then don't try to pass laws that violate it. (Some of us take seriously the pledge to "preserve, protect and defend" the Constitution)You get the idea. If the Left don't want "heated rhetoric" from the Right, then the solution is simple: ---RELATED: Don Surber is on the same page with his outstanding post, "I do not want civil discourse."Its my turn now. I am not going to scream back. But I refuse to allow anyone to dictate what I say or how I say it. I refuse to allow the same foul-mouthed, foul-spirited foul people who dumped on me to now try to tell me what I may or may not say.My free speech matters more than the feelings of anyone on the left. You dont like what I say? Tough.I will not allow people to label my words Hate Speech or try to lecture me on civility. I saw the lefty signs. The lefts definition of civil discourse is surreal.We have a terribly unfit president who has expanded government control beyond not only what is constitutional but what is healthy for our freedom.Indeed, this call for civil discourse is itself a direct threat to my free speech.So screw you.Posted byFull Metal Patriotat11:50 AM0commentsLinks to this postEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Google BuzzLabels:conservatism,Democrats,liberals,RepublicansSaturday, January 15, 2011Napolitano cancels "Virtual Fence" along U.S. borderI've never been a fan of the "virtual fence" project, I always thought Bush was totally wrong on immigration enforcement. I'm only surprised it's taken the Obama administration this long to scrap the project:Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Friday that she has canceled the troubled virtual fence project along the southwest border, proposing a new plan which she claims will better address each region's border security needs. The decision comes a year after the secretary ordered a review of the project, which was hampered by delays and technological glitches, and froze its funding. The original plan, known as SBInet, envisioned a system of cameras and sensors which would allow officers to monitor crossings and dispatch Border Patrol agents to catch anyone entering the United States illegally. Napolitano said her department briefed members of Congress on Friday about the final decision to nix the program "as originally conceived." But she said DHS will pursue a "new path forward" for security along the 2,000-mile southern U.S. border. The secretary said that while the U.S. cannot provide a "single, integrated border security technology solution," the new plan will use different technologies in different areas. That could mean a system of surveillance towers in one area and unmanned drones in another. It could mean thermal imaging in one area and elements of the old SBInet plan in another. "There is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution to meet our border technology needs, and this new strategy is tailored to the unique needs of each border region, providing faster deployment of technology, better coverage, and a more effective balance between cost and capability," Napolitano said. Ok, fine, scrap the virtual fence that Obama had said would be "the better approach" rather than a REAL fence (like the one around the White House). Maybe now we can finish the Secure Fence Act of 2006 that Obama voted for when he was a senator.Posted byFull Metal Patriotat11:39 AM1 commentsLinks to this postEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Google BuzzLabels:illegal immigrationFriday, January 14, 2011Vitriolic BlogrollingI'm emotionally worn out from the nonsensical attacks from the Left this week.

His words were well-written and spoken with the right tone. It was a fine performance. He honored those who were wounded and killed, as well as those whose heroic actions mitigated the tragedy. We saw, for a brief instant, the kind of moving speech that landed an unqualified Barack Obama in the Oval Office.These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle.  They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength.  Heroism is here, in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens, all around us, just waiting to be summoned - as it was on Saturday morning. Their actions, their selflessness poses a challenge to each of us.  It raises a question of what, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward.  How can we honor the fallen?  How can we be true to their memory?You see, when a tragedy like this strikes, it is part of our nature to demand explanations - to try and pose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which seems senseless.  Already weve seen a national conversation commence, not only about the motivations behind these killings, but about everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our mental health system.  And much of this process, of debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future, is an essential ingredient in our exercise of self-government.But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized - at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happen to think differently than we do - its important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that were talking with each other in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.Unfortunately, Obama's words about "honoring the fallen" were upstaged by crass campaigning. The grave and somber nature of a memorial service was marred by Team Obama's efforts to brand this crisis with a "Together We Thrive" logo and free souvenir t-shirts. Governor Jan Brewer was even booed by some in the crowd (so much for the Presidents message of unity). Why was this moment turned into a presidential pep rally? Yes, I know that the University of Arizona created the props and got everything set up, but since Teh Lightworker is already planning his reelection campaign, you can't tell me for a moment that David Axelrod and Team Obama didn't preview and approve every nuanced detail of last night's performance. This was too much political theater and not enough memorial. Another crisis that didn't go to waste.---UPDATE: Many others found last night's political circus to be more than a little unseemly. Serr8d described it as "A political pep rally where a Memorial service broke through. Somewhere in the background. If you looked hard enough, you could grasp that a Memorial Service was...nearby."Michelle Malkin asks, "Will there be giant foam fingers and blue cotton candy, too?"Proof Positive notes the inappropriate use of the word "thrive" in Obama's branding; The families of the dead may thrive again one day. But not now. Not today. The wounded and traumatized may flourish at some future time. But not now. Not today.Cassy Fiano paid attention to Obama's reaction to the crowd during his speech; Not once did he ask for solemnity or respect. Instead, he basked in the blow of the fawning adoration hes undoubtedly missed since being elected.Say Anything notes Obama's belated message of civility; Oh, really? Where were you with this message four days ago? You jumped all over the Cambridge cops who arrested Professor Gates, before you had all the details, saying they Acted stupidly. Want to weigh in on any of the liberals who acted stupidly in assigning blame and linking this tragedy to Sarah Palin? Didnt think so. In fact, you called one of the head miscreants, Sheriff Dupnik (capital dupe), to thank him in spite of his politically motivated and baseless slurs and slandering of conservatives.---UPDATE: One more thing  and I just can't let this one slide; during his speech, President Obama disingenuously implied that his visit with Gabrielle Giffords caused her to open her eyes "for the first time.""I have just come from the University Medical Center, just a mile from here, where our friend Gabby courageously fights to recover even as we speak.  And I want to tell you -- her husband Mark is here and he allows me to share this with you -- right after we went to visit, a few minutes after we left her room and some of her colleagues in Congress were in the room, Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.  (Applause.)  Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.  (Applause.) Gabby opened her eyes.  Gabby opened her eyes, so I can tell you she knows we are here.Apparently, Mr. Obama believes his own messiah schtick as fully as the crowd did. Because it was already reported on Sunday that Giffords was able to open her eyes. The Sonoran Chronicle had reported this on January 9, The Tucson Sentinel reported it on January 11. This portion of Obama's speech was blatant emotional manipulation.Hopefully, Congresswoman Giffords will continue her miraculous recovery without excessive publicity. And the rest of the nation can take a deep breath and move on to the serious business at hand.Posted byFull Metal Patriotat9:33 AM3commentsLinks to this postEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Google BuzzLabels:Barack ObamaOlder PostsHomeSubscribe to:Posts (Atom)Twitter UpdatesTwitter Updatesfollow me on TwitterBlog Archive2011(30)January(30)Rep.
