CoplanSometime toward the end of the industrial revolution, western industrialcountries discovered a new way to power their steam engines,which had previously been powered by burning wood andcoal. This energy source promised to power the machines of civilizationand progress far into the future. This energy source seemed atthe time to be cheap and limitless, and contained an energy density(energy potential per unit weight) far exceeding those of fuels previouslyused to power steam engines. 1 Unfortunately for the generationsthat would follow, the early proponents of this energy sourcesimply ignored the waste by-product of this fuel cycle. The wastesproduced by this fuel will likely, at a minimum, render currentlypopulated places in the world uninhabitable, and, at worst, threatenthe survival of the human species. 'DIese impacts will affect generationsfar into the future.Although this paragraph could well describe the climate impacts ofburning fossil fuels, I am not talking about the carbon cycle andglobal warming. I am talking about the impacts of nuclear energyproduction. Proponents of nuclear energy tout the energy source asthe most promising offset to greenhouse gases produced in electricitygeneration. These proponents eagerly await the additional directand indirect subsidies for new nuclear power plants that would flowfrom various carbon tax and emissions trading schemes. Carbonemissions trading and offset schemes will subsidize the nuclear energyindustry indirectly, by making competing fossil fuel based energymore expensive, and by potentially offering marketable offsetcredits for new nuclear energy generation projects that displace existingcarbon-based energy generation.This essay explains that such encouragement of nuclear energyproduction as a "solution" to fossil fuel-induced climate change willcreate environmental problems equally as grave as' those posed by acarbon-based energy economy. Both nuclear energy and fossil energyimpose enormous environmental externalities that are not capturedby the economics of energy production and distribution. Whileemissions trading schemes seek to harness market-based efficienciesto accomplish pre-determined reductions, they neither seek to norsucceed in capturing the environmental externalities of energy generation.By creating a set of incentives without capturing all of theexternalities, these trading schemes will simply distort the market,possibly leading to a worse overall damage to the environment thanglobal warming by itself.Ultimately, nuclear power production as an alternative to carbonbasedenergy production simply presents a choice of evils. Efforts toreduce carbon emissions must not come at the expense of distortingenergy markets in a way that exacerbates the equally insurmountableproblems posed by the multi-millennial storage of hazardous nuclearwaste.<snip> http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/489 /The Externalities of Nuclear Power:First, Assume We Have a Can Opener...Karl S. Coplan*INTRODUCTIONThe nuclear power industry has latched on to global warming as anargument for its renaissance. Although even industry proponentsacknowledge that the problem of disposing of spent nuclear fuel remainsunsolved, the industry routinely assumes this problem will be solved inthe future. Unfortunately, this is the same assumption made by nuclearenergy proponents at the beginning of the nuclear industry fifty yearsago. We havent solved the nuclear waste problem in the past halfcentury, and there is no reason to think we will be more likely to do so inthe next one. Like the shipwrecked economist in the old joke, thenuclear industry continues to postulate that we should assume we have acan opener for the nuclear waste problem.1While the impacts of global warming are described asintergenerational, the impacts of the nuclear waste cycle are betterdescribed as inter-civilizational.2 Nuclear fuel wastes remain hazardousfor hundreds of thousands to as much as a million years.3 By contrast,recorded human history goes back only about 5,000 years, and humancivilization is only about 10,000 years old. Globally, none of thegenerators of nuclear fuel waste have successfully implemented anypermanent disposal option for nuclear waste, leaving this externality ofnuclear energy production as a problem for future generations, or, morelikely, for future civilizations. Put simply, the nuclear industry, withgovernment complicity, has transferred and deferred the most expensivepart of the cost of the nuclear fuel cycle to future generations andcivilizations unknown.Nor are the environmental and public health costs of nuclear wastethe only ones that nuclear energy generation has externalized. Nucleargeneration also poses a risk externality  the economic and social harmsthat the public has assumed in the event of a radiation release, for whichthe generating industry has limited liability. This risk externality arisesnot only from the risk of accidental reactor meltdown and release ofradioactivity, but also from the proliferation and terrorism risks that areinseparable from any scheme of nuclear energy production and wastedisposal.These twin externalities, waste and risk, make any nuclearrenaissance an unsatisfactory substitute for fossil fuel power generation.As horrendous as the impacts of global warming will be  millions ofpeople displaced and dead  the likely long-term impacts of increasednuclear energy production are comparable, and longer lasting.<snip>Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopName removed      (0 posts)Wed Jan-05-11 12:02 AMResponse to Reply #1622.Deleted sub-threadSub-thread removed by moderator.

We humans can probably survive quite handily alongside the remains of biodiversity, I'm guessing dogs, rats, roaches, and mosquitoes, and germs; even if every other species on earth perishes - as long as we are willing to say goodbye to pretty wall calendars, and the occasional glimpse of a land or sea critter when we go hiking or beach-combing.  I believe the scientists who say once the oceans are dead, life on earth can't continue, and that is the enormous tragedy of our time - that we who have a clue must watch helplessly as we humans murder our mother earth.I agree with the poster who cited population explosion as the root cause of the other choices: fresh water depletion, resource depletion, energy depletion, food scarcity.  Aside from the political hell and resource wars that we have to look forward to, I don't see any problem to letting nature run it's course as it always has and always will, despite our narcissism and "let's pretend" fantasies that we humans can reproduce like a metastasizing cancer and not kill our host (the planet). I personally like reality.  I'm better and healthier when I live in respect of its limitations and rules, and I believe mankind will be better off taking several vicious ruler slaps on the back of the hands for our tremendous arrogance in thinking that our technology can trump our physical environment.  If we had been given overpopulation as a choice, I would have been tempted to choose it, but as the topic brings out the worst in almost everyone, especially freedom-loving Americans, I can fully understand why you avoided offering it.

Most of the ecological problems in the world twine together with human activities like a mating ball of snakes.On top of my list, always, is carbon dioxide which I consider the main villain of the play.  From CO2 comes climate change and ocean acidification.  The warming aspect of climate change contributes to water shortages and biodiversity loss, while the climatic variability it introduces contributes to food shortages.  Ocean acidification also contributes to more biodiversity loss and food shortages.Energy shortages are likely to contribute to a number of ecological problems, as weve already seen with the growth of coal generation around the world.  Another risk that will crop up in many places as oil and gas supplies begin to decline is the increasing use of local biomass as fuel.  That means burning trees, which leads to deforestation with the loss of carbon sinks (more global warming), loss of habitats (more biodiversity loss) and ground water.  Energy shortages will also lead to more development of resources like tar sands and shale gas, resulting in more damage to water supplies and species habitats.Non-energy resource shortages result in more intensive exploitation of ever more fragile and remote areas of the planet, increasing the pressure on other species.Pollution of all kinds leads to biodiversity loss in addition to the toxicity risks it poses to humans.Food shortages have their own ecological impact as people turn to local, non-traditional food sources (aka eating the songbirds out of the trees).  This increases the pressure on biodiversity due to direct decimation of target species and the disruption of local ecological balances.How much of this is due to human overpopulation, and how much of it is due to human overactivity?  Its tempting to say that its because there are just too damn many of us, but I think thats a bit too simplistic.The one set of effects that is unarguably the result of human numbers includes anything to do with eating. Each of us needs the same minimum number of calories per day to survive, and every human mouth thats added to the planet brings with it a 2500 calorie a day appetite.  The spiraling race between population and food supplies increases the pressure on water supplies and biodiversity, as well as contributing to river, ocean and ground water pollution.Other effects that may appear to be the result of overpopulation  such as resource shortages, energy shortages and industrial pollution  are largely the result of human activity.  In fact, the majority of the damage we are doing to the planet is the result of our activity and not our numbers.  I say this for a number of reasons:1. Human population growth is no longer exponential, it's linear. We are adding a constant 80 million people to the planet every year, but this growth is constant, not exponential. Population growth has been approximately constant ever since we left the sheltering umbrella of the Green Revolution in 1980. This simple fact lends great credence to Russ Hopfenberg's theory that food causes people.2. Humanity is in ecological overshoot already. Our consumption of global biosystem resources is up to 50% greater than the natural workld can support, if WWF and the Global Footprint Network are to be believed. If our population magically stopped growing tonight, if we could cut our growth by 80 million people a year right now, we would still be in overshoot. We are simply consuming too much for the planet's safety.3. The half of the world's births that occur in nations with the highest ecological footprints consume three times as much of the world's resources as the half that occurs in the nations with the lowest ecological footprints.4. If the Ecological Footprint is a good measure of sustainability (and I think it is) the world could comfortably support its current population in perpetuity at the living standard of Vietnam. If we each had the same ecological footprint as the average Indian the earth could sustainably support over twice as many people as it does today.5. The problem is that we don't have the ecological footprint of India.  The world average is more on a par with Costa Rica or Turkey, with industrialized nations consuming 5 to 10 times the sustainable biocapacity. The 2 billion people that lead unsustainable lives in developed nations consume as much of the planet's biocapacity as the 5 billion who lead sustainable lives in countries where the average ecological footprint is below a sustainable 1.8 global hectares.So while our population numbers are definitely a problem, our consumption represents a much bigger one.  Yes, there are probably too many people, but its our consumption, not our numbers, that is wrecking the planet.While I recognize that others are of a very different opinion, nuclear issues - whether they are proliferation, waste storage, radiation releases or even outright warfare - seem almost insignificant to me.  The ecological threats I talked about above are global in scope, are happening as we speak and are accelerating in severity with every passing year.  The significance of localized issues like nuclear waste storage, or the risks posed by proliferation seems almost picayune in comparison.But this is just my take on it.  As Ive said before, we need to have everyone who is moved by the predicament working on whatever issues are most important to them, in whatever way they feel is appropriate.  We never know what the crucial problem may turn out to be, or where an essential answer might be found.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPooka Fey      (1000+ posts)Wed Jan-05-11 02:18 PMResponse to Reply #2731.My feedback on your much welcomed didactic post.I regularly hear this argument that the earth (although admittedly already in overshoot) can sustainably support twice as many humans as it does today IF those humans agree to consume/have the ecological footprint of the average Indian.  My reasons for not agreeing with this argument are as follows:1st:  We don't get to hear the opinions of the other great species with which we share this planet, because we can't understand their language and mental processes (I might add, nor do we really care to pay attention).  What is the opinion of the Indian elephants, humpback whales, or the mountain gorillas on this theory?  Do African lions agree that the earth can sustainably support twice the number of humans as it does today?  I doubt it.The male leader of a pride of lions requires 100 square miles (259 sq kilometers) of grassland, scrub or open woodland territory (meaning quality land - not sand dunes, not toxic, ecologically blighted abandoned slum-land) to support his pride: which includes (from National Geographic) 3 male lions, a dozen or so lionesses and their young.  The young male lions must eventually leave the pride and (if they are strong enough), take over the leadership of another pride from an older and/or weaker male lion.  This other pride also requires 100 square miles of quality land.  I don't want to look up the territory requirements for elephants, but you get my point.  All theories about the number of humans the earth can support are, to my mind, just another sad example of our subconscious, unquestioned psychological blind spot:  We humans have divine right to rule and dominate the earth and all its creatures; after all God has decreed it so. 2nd:  How do you convince a human being to forgo all the goodies of modern industrial civilization once they are born?  How many real 21st century Indians are willing to limit their ecological footprint to the footprint of the "average" Indian?  Now that their nation has finally arrived, now that they have taken their seat at the all-you-can-eat buffet table of 21st century life, what right do we few chastened modern Americans have to say anything to the citizens of India about limiting their consumption levels, just because our poor planet is dying?  The Indian automobile industry is now one of the largest in the world and the fastest growing globally, producing over 11 million vehicles annually.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Ind... )  So let's talk about limiting CO2 emissions now... 3rd:  Our modern world economy depends on convincing humans to borrow and consume, so I find it really disingenuous to repeat this idea that we as a species can continue to spawn, because we have a linear growth rate and not an exponential growth rate.  Are we supposed to convince the 80 million new annual worldwide baby spawnlings to grow up and voluntarily choose to abide by a low-impact ecologically sustainable footprint?  (If they have the good fortune to have a choice in the matter, that is.)  To do so, you would be working against the banking/political/industrial/media complex, which has constructed an elaborate hologram (thanks, Joe Bageant) of reality television entertainment, Internet(s), video games, pornography, etc. which spectacularly occupies the consumer's attention 24/7.  This complex will continue directing tiny spawnling consumers worldwide toward their destiny of consumption and borrowing, concurrently circumventing all awareness of issues like CO2 emissions and ocean acidification and what it means for the future of of life on earth.  So how does it help to remain relatively sanguine about the issue of 80 million annual new potential VISA card holders, because those numbers are really only a secondary concern if we can limit their planetary footprints?I can only discuss solutions in terms of what I consider to be my personal responsibilities and actions.  I currently don't own a car, because I have the luxury of living in a walkable city with a good public transportation system.  (Disclaimer:  I have rented a car twice since September, because I needed to do a big grocery shopping trip and/or an IKEA run.  I also sometimes WISH I owned a car, because I live in a cold, rainy & snowy city and it's more work and much less comfortable to do everything I need to do on foot/using the buses).  I believe that my actions, though practically insignificant, do make a difference on some obscure, metaphysical level.  I have spoken to people twenty years younger than myself who are convinced that no action is worth the effort, (recycling, taking the bus, supporting local sustainable farmers) because according to them: nothing makes any difference anyway.  I could never stomach living my life under such a nihilistic personal philosophy, even though I admit that they might be right. I hope not.It's just a sad, depressing subject all around, but it does desperately need thought and examination.  Thanks for posting, GliderGuider.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopGliderGuider      (1000+ posts)Wed Jan-05-11 02:32 PMResponse to Reply #3132.We won't cut our population, we won't cut our consumption, and we're 50% into overshoot...Edited on Wed Jan-05-11 02:34 PM by GliderGuiderTPTB don't want us to cut either our numbers or our habits, and they have conspired with our evolved brain structure to make sure that most of us see it their way.  That doesn't sound very good, does it?  But that's the way it is, here on Planet Earth at the beginning of the 21st century.This is why I have pulled all my efforts back to the individual level.  The fact that there are people like you out there, Pooka Fey, that there are quite a few more like you and that everyone who shares this point of view learned it from somewhere -- all that means that individuals are reachable, even as the masses shuffle obediently off towards the cliff.Rather than moaning with despair as the ship goes down, I choose to dance. Who knows what might happen if enough people made that choice?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPooka Fey      (1000+ posts)Wed Jan-05-11 02:46 PMResponse to Reply #3233....Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNihil      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 04:50 AMResponse to Reply #3139.Excellent points in your reply to an excellent post.(Especially about the territory requirements for animal ranges.)

Any time there is some intelligent discussion available on DU these days, I'm ready to throw in my 2 cents.  Luckily for my agenda, (and unhappily for our society) discussions usually degenerate pretty rapidly on DU these days, so my typical contribution is a KnR.  It was nice for me to put some thought into an idea - DU can be a fantastic forum still.(Sorry to be completely off-topic here, GliderGuider, also I'm sorry for assuming that you are American like me.  Speaking of blind spots)I hope that's a pint of Fuller's London Pride ale in my "smily" tanker - my current favorite amber beer.  My 1st taste was served ice-cold and it was delicious, however I was scolded by my London born drinking buddy for enjoying it.  She said that ale should be served at room temperature - and I replied that she was sounding suspiciously like the French.  As luck would have it, the tavern had just barely put the bottles in the cooler so our second round was served just slightly colder than room temperature and, though I hate to admit it, she was right.  All the complex flavors were evident in the room-temperature brew that were masked when the beer was served cold. It's never too late to learn something new, even for an American.

I'd suggest that what's doing China in isn't their poverty per se but rather their desire to make 1.3 billion people affluent by catering the the existing overconsumptive affluence of the industrialized world...Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopThe Croquist      (1000+ posts)Thu Jan-06-11 10:02 AMResponse to Reply #3641.Look at the differences between developed and undeveloped nationsI used the CIA World Factbook for the data and put it in a spreadsheet.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-fact... The richest 52% of the countries using per capita GDP had the following statistics:Life Expectancy            74.59 years   Population Growth Rate     0.59%GDP - per capita (PPP)     $17,257.24The poorest 48% of the countries using per capita GDP had the following statistics:Life Expectancy            64.31 years   Population Growth Rate     1.67%GDP - per capita (PPP)     $2,786.78The per capita GDP is 1/6th, the life expectancy 10 years less but the population growth rate is almost 3 times as high.China was number 124 of 219 countries that I included in my comparison * so I wouldn't call it affluent although it did make into the richest half(in last place). It has a per capita GDP of $6,700 compared to Taiwan's $32,000 yet it is the most polluted country in the world.The point is that poverty is closely linked to population growth and pollution.* I did not include 20 countries because the data was incomplete. By far the largest is Zimbabwe. Their total population was 0.26% of the worlds population.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptinrobot      (1000+ posts)Thu Jan-06-11 10:51 AMResponse to Original message42.Self-deleteEdited on Thu Jan-06-11 10:54 AM by tinrobotPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopCRH      (507 posts)Thu Jan-06-11 12:28 PMResponse to Original message43.The Greatest threat to humanity ...is IMHO population over shoot in relation to our ability to provide sustenance.This will likely effect bio-diversity, water supply, and eventually add to defoliation. This in turn could add to CO2 levels further straining feedback loops. In the end, the degradation of ecology and environment could eventually lead to a die off that might actually help large portions of the earth's surviving bio-diversity, to endure and evolve.Within this prediction, I can not imagine many good scenarios for 90% of the humans present today. The remaining 10% could find bountiful potential in some locations.
