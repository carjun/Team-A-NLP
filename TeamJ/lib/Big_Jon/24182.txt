The large money bust was one of two southbound currency  seizures CBP officers made over the holiday weekend at the El Paso port  of entry.CBP officers working outbound at the Bridge of the Americas seized $420,440 concealed within the seats of a 2006 Chevrolet Cheyenne on Monday, January 17, 2011.The larger of the two seizures was made at about 9:30  a.m. Monday while CBP officers, U.S. Border Patrol agents, and Homeland  Security Investigations (HSI) special agents were conducting southbound  operations at the Bridge of the Americas (BOTA). CBP officers selected a  2006 Chevrolet Cheyenne for an intensive exam. The driver of the  vehicle said he had nothing to declare during routine questioning by the  CBP officer.CBP officers initiated  an intensive exam during which CBP currency and firearms detector  sniffing dog Enzo alerted to the vehicle. CBP officers noted  discrepancies on the vehicle seats and found 16 bundles of U.S. currency  hidden within the seats. CBP officers and Border Patrol agents spent  several hours counting 15,430 individual bills which added up to  $420,440.The driver, Jose Felix  Vizcarra, a Mexican citizen who resides in Ciudad Juarez, was turned  over to HSI special agents after federal prosecution was accepted. He  remains in the El Paso County jail without bond. The vehicle was seized  by CBP officers.CBP officers made the additional outbound currency seizure on Saturday totaling $15,079.The  combined efforts of our Office of Field Operations officers and Border  Patrol agents with HSI agents in the outbound area create a force  multiplier effect that results in significant seizures, said Bill  Molaski, CBP port director, El Paso. Every single dollar we stop from  being smuggled out of the country makes it harder for criminal  organizations to further their illegal activity.Individuals  are permitted to carry any amount of currency or monetary instruments  into or out of the U.S. However, if the quantity is $10,000 or higher,  they must formally report the currency to CBP. Failure to declare may  result in seizure of the currency and/or arrest. An individual may  petition for the return of currency seized by CBP officers, but the  petitioner must prove that the source and intended use of the currency  was legitimate.CBP Field Operations  is responsible for securing our borders at the ports of entry.

Lopez was Wanted by the Lafayette Police  Department for Aggravated Rape. In December, Lopez allegedly raped a  fifteen year old girl. After the incident, Detectives with the Lafayette  Police Department (LPD) were unable to locate Lopez; on January 14th LPD  Detectives secured an Arrest Warrant against Lopez and requested the  assistance of the US Marshals Violent Offenders Task Force (VOTF) in  Lafayette.The day the Warrant was signed (Friday), VOTF members in Lafayette developed  credible information that Lopez was hiding in Conroe, Texas. Yesterday  morning (Saturday), VOTF members in Lafayette contacted the Gulf Coast  Violent Offenders and Fugitive Task Force (GCVO) in Houston requesting TFOs  to follow-up on the leads in Conroe. GCVO Task Force Officers in Houston  immediately responded to the leads developed; within a few hours they had  Lopez identified through surveillance, and shortly thereafter arrested Lopez  without incident. Lopez was booked at the Montgomery County Sheriffs  Office and is awaiting Extradition back to Lafayette. Further, Immigration  and Customs Enforcement (ICE) placed a detainer against Lopez as he is  allegedly in the United States illegally. It should be noted that Lopez was  in handcuffs in less than twenty-four hours after the Warrant was signed.Henry Whitehorn, the United States Marshal for the Western District of  Louisiana, said, The coordinated effort of all law enforcement to bring  dangerous criminals to justice ensures that the streets and neighborhoods of  Louisiana are a safer place to raise our children.The Western District of Louisianas Violent Offenders Task Force (VOTF) in  Lafayette is a team comprised of full-time law enforcement officers from the  Lafayette City Marshals, Iberia Parish Sheriffs Office, Lafayette Police  Department, St. Mary Parish Sheriffs Office, Louisiana Probation and  Parole, and St. Martin Parish Sheriffs Office. Further, VOTF calls upon  part-time TFOs throughout its eight parish area. In 2009 VOTF in Lafayette  closed approximately 600 Warrants, most of which were violent felony  offenses. US Marshals Task Forces throughout the United States arrested  more than 73,000 state and local fugitives on felony charges.Additional information about the U.S. Marshals can be found at http://www.usmarshals.gov.

Just the weapons seized in Alta Verapaz are more than those of  some army brigades.Before Colom ordered the military operation,  the Zetas were operating with impunity in Guatemala, undermining  Mexicos battle against drug cartels. Officials worry Central Americas  weak governments are unable to contain the spreading threat of cartels  in the region.The United States is pumping $1.4 billion into the  region to help governments attack drug gangs, but most of the funds are  earmarked for Mexico. There, turf wars between gangs and attacks on  cartels by the government have killed more than 34,000 people in the  four years since President Felipe Calderon launched his own  military-backed war on cartels. Less than a fifth of U.S. funds go to  Central America and the Caribbean.Patrolling in Alta Verapaz with  armored cars, Guatemalan soldiers have found tortured bodies, luxury  cars, assault weapons and an air strip used by drug gangs in the  mountainous, coffee-growing state north of the Guatemalan capital.They  arrested at least 22 men accused of working for the Zetas, who  officials say are operating in three-quarters of Guatemalas territory, a  smuggling corridor for South American cocaine. Criminals have long  collaborated with Mexican gangs but during the past few years the  cartels have begun to move in more permanently, extorting businesses and  corrupting locals.LATENT THREATThe army says it made  important progress in Alta Verapaz, after dozens of drug-related  killings late last year. But theres still a latent threat, Colonel  Marco Tulio Vasquez, head of anti-drug operations in the state, told  Reuters in the town of Coban.While the siege could be extended or  troops sent elsewhere, Guatemalas army remains weak and underfunded,  limiting its ability to echo Mexicos war on traffickers.Peace  accords in 1996 that ended 36 years of fighting between leftist rebels  and government forces ordered the army be slashed in size, dwindling  from a 50,000-strong force to just 17,000 soldiers today. Dozens of  military bases, including one in Alta Verapaz, were closed.Soldiers  earn as little as $150 a month and are hired on a temporary basis.  Troops often switch sides, swayed by high salaries offered by the drug  cartels. The Zetas, originally formed by Mexican army deserters, have  been known to recruit elite Guatemalan troops known as Kaibils who are  trained in jungle warfare and infamous for brutal civil war-era abuses.The  army is more trusted than Guatemalas notoriously corrupt police, but  many people are highly suspicious of men in uniform as the military  struggles to shake its dark past.Nearly a quarter of a million  people, mostly native Mayans, died during the civil war, and a  U.N.-backed Truth Commission report found the army committed 85 percent  of the killings.The army still provokes bad memories, said Carmen Rosa de Leon, a human rights leader in Guatemala City.(Writing by Robin Emmott; editing by Mica Rosenberg)Posted in Uncategorized |Leave a commentPinal County..Desert Chase Nets Massive PotBustPosted on January 18, 2011 by usbni Pinal Co.

As such, it is a key player in combating the flow of illegal drugs to the United States. The Coast Guards mission is to reduce the supply of drugs from the source by denying smugglers the use of air and maritime routes in the Transit Zone, a six million square mile area, including the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Pacific. In meeting the challenge of patrolling this vast area, the Coast Guard coordinates closely with other federal agencies and countries within the region to disrupt and deter the flow of illegal drugs.OverviewThe Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime drug interdiction and shares lead responsibility for air interdiction with the U.S. Customs Service.

The Coast Guards mission is to reduce the supply of drugs from the source by denying smugglers the use of air and maritime routes in the Transit Zone, a six million square mile area, including the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Pacific. In meeting the challenge of patrolling this vast area, the Coast Guard coordinates closely with other federal agencies and countries within the region to disrupt and deter the flow of illegal drugs. In addition to deterrence, Coast Guard drug interdiction accounts for nearly 52% of all U.S. government seizures of cocaine each year. For Fiscal Year 2002 the rate of Coast Guard cocaine seizures alone had an estimated import value of approximately $3.9 billion.Counter-drug smuggling mission backgroundIn 1870, Chinese immigrants became the first known drug smugglers when they began smuggling opium in merchant ship cargoes and baggage. Since then, drug smuggling by maritime routes has grown in size, scope and sophistication as demand skyrocketed. For example, around the turn of the century, when cocaine use was first in vogue, a relatively limited amount of the population was directly affected by the problems of cocaine abuse. But in later years, as the drugs of choice shifted from cocaine to heroin and opium, then later to marijuana and back to cocaine, drug smugglers began utilizing maritime sea and air routes to transport larger shipments of drugs to the U.S. For nearly a century, the maritime drug smuggling business slowly evolved while the Coast Guard focused its attention on the major events of the day, including World War I, Prohibition, World War II, the Korean and Vietnam wars.During the 1920s Congress tasked the Coast Guard with enforcing the 18th Amendment, necessitating a dramatic increase in resources and funding for the Coast Guard.  The massive effort needed to curtail the substantial level of alcohol smuggling required the single largest appropriation for personnel and new ship construction in its history. In addition, the Navy transferred more than 20 WWI-era destroyers and minesweepers for conversion to the Coast Guards battle with rum-runners, which ended with the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition. The Coast Guards unique expertise in countering smuggling operations also came into play during the Vietnam War, when the Navy asked for our expertise to support Operation Market Time, an intensive multi-year campaign to stop the Communist flow of arms and supplies by sea. The Coast Guard utilized its expertise in stopping smuggling while facilitating legitimate commerce. Our patrol boats and cutters patrolled 1,200 miles of coastline and had to contend with more than 60,000 junks and sampans. The Coast Guard and Navys success in Operation Market Time, substantially reduced the amount of at- sea smuggling, forcing the Viet Cong to use the longer and more difficult land route of the infamous Ho Chi Minh Trail.Shortly after the war in Vietnam ended, the Coast Guard found itself fighting another wara war that is still going on today with a determined, well-financed opposition. In the early 1970s maritime drug smuggling became a much more significant problem for the Coast Guard and we began making seizures while engaged in other operations, like Search and Rescue and Fisheries Law Enforcement. 1973 saw a dramatic increase in smuggling attempts and the Coast Guard conducted its first Coast Guard-controlled seizure on March 8, 1973, when the USCGC Dauntless boarded a 38-foot sports fisherman, the Big L and arrested its master and crew, with more than a ton of marijuana on board. Since then, the Coast Guard has seized countless tons of marijuana and cocaine. Since Fiscal Year 1997 to present, the Coast Guard has seized 806,469 pounds of cocaine and 333,285 pounds of marijuana.Alien Migrant InterdictionIntroductionAs the United         States primary maritime law enforcement agency, the Coast Guard is         tasked with enforcing immigration law at sea. The Coast Guard conducts         patrols and coordinates with other federal agencies and foreign         countries to interdict undocumented migrants at sea, denying them entry         via maritime routes to the United States, its territories and         possessions. Thousands of people try to enter this country         illegally every year using maritime routes, many via smuggling         operations. Interdicting migrants at sea means they can be quickly         returned to their countries of origin without the costly processes         required if they successfully enter the United States.When         successful, illegal immigration can potentially cost U.S. taxpayers         billions of dollars each year in social services. In addition to         relieving this financial burden on our citizens, the Coast Guards         efforts help to support legal migration systems. Primarily, the Coast         Guard maintains its humanitarian responsibility to prevent the loss of         life at sea, since the majority of migrant vessels are dangerously         overloaded, unseaworthy or otherwise unsafe.OverviewAs the primary maritime law enforcement agency, the Coast Guard is tasked with enforcing immigration law at sea.

Interdicting migrants at sea means they can be quickly returned to their countries of origin without the costly processes required if they successfully enter the United States. The Coast Guard supports the National Policy to promote safe, legal, and orderly migration.Illegal immigration can costs U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars each year in social services. In addition to relieving this financial burden on our citizens, the Coast Guards efforts help to support the use of legal migration systems. Primarily, the Coast Guard maintains its humanitarian responsibility to prevent the loss of life at sea, since the majority of migrant vessels are dangerously overloaded, unseaworthy or otherwise unsafe.Protection from political persecution and torture are important concerns for the U.S. During the course of migrant interdictions, Coast Guard crews may encounter migrants requesting protection. The Department of State (Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration) and the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services establish the policies in this area and handle all potential asylum cases on our cutters.The Coast Guards role in migrant interdiction has been a part of our history since the services inception (see  History of Coast Guard in Illegal Immigration). The mission gained high visibility during the first mass migration emergency the United States faced between April 21 and September 28, 1980. Fidel Castro permitted any person who wanted to leave Cuba free access to depart from the port of Mariel, Cuba. Known as the  Mariel Boatlift, approximately 124,000 undocumented Cuban migrants entered the United States by a flotilla of mostly U.S. vessels in violation of U.S. law. The Coast Guard interdicted vessels en route to Mariel Harbor, as well as provided search and rescue assistance to vessels bound for the United States. The Coast Guard also provided assistance to other federal agencies in the processing, investigation and prosecution of boat owners suspected of violating U.S. law.The hazards of illegal maritime migration was highlighted in 1981, when the bodies of 30 Haitian migrants washed ashore on Hillsboro Beach, FL. In response to 1980 mass migration from Cuba and the increasing number of Haitian migrants landing in the U.S., on September 29, 1981, President Reagan issued  Presidential Proclamation 4865, which suspended the entry of undocumented migrants to the U.S. from the high seas.Between 1991 and 1995, there was a dramatic increase in the number of undocumented migrants interdicted by the Coast Guard. During this period, over 120,000 migrants from 23 countries were interdicted. Haitian migrants began increased departures after a 1991 coup in Haiti. These migrants were processed for asylum claims first on ships, then at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (GTMO). Those that were identified as leaving for economic reasons were returned to Haiti. The camp eventually became a magnet for those departing seeking food, shelter, and a chance to get into the U.S. During this time, the camp at GTMO contained over 12,000 migrants.In 1992, President Bush issued Executive Order 12807 directing the Coast Guard to enforce the suspension of the entry of undocumented migrants by interdicting them at sea, and return them to their country of origin or departure.In 1993, Operation ABLE MANNER commenced. This operation concentrated Coast Guard patrols in the Windward Passage (the body of water between Haiti and Cuba) to interdict Haitian migrants. Operation ABLE MANNER continued until a new government was in place in Haiti in 1994. Today, Haitian migrants still leave Haiti attempting to reach the U.S. Many travel to the Bahamas and enter on smaller boats, while some attempt direct entry to the U.S. in large boat loads. There is a Coast Guard Liaison Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Port au Prince, Haiti, who handles various migration, counterdrug, and international engagement issues with Haiti.In 1994, the Coast Guard was involved in its largest peacetime operation since the Vietnam war, responding to two mass migrations at the same time-first from Haiti, then from Cuba. Over 63,000 migrants were rescued and prevented from illegally entering the U.S. in Operations ABLE MANNER and ABLE VIGIL. At its height, Operation ABLE MANNER involved 17 U.S. Coast Guard vessels, patrolling the coast of Haiti while Operation ABLE VIGIL involved 38 Coast Guard cutters patrolling the Straits of Florida. Migration from Cuba continues. There has been a shift from migrants taking to sea in rafts to employing smugglers. The dangers of this are no less than rafting as illustrated by the deaths of numerous migrants in 1998-2000, when overloaded vessels capsized. Information on Cuban Migrant Interdiction Policy is available from an Immigration recording at 1-800-264-2577.The Dominican Republic has historically been a major source country for undocumented migrants attempting to enter the U.S.. Crossing the Mona Passage (the body of water between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico) to enter Puerto Rico, thousands of people have taken to sea in a variety of vessels, the most common is a homemade fishing vessel known as a  Yola. Most of these migrants are smuggled by highly organized gangs. From April 1, 1995 through October 1, 1997, the Coast Guard conducted Operation ABLE RESPONSE, with enhanced operations dedicated to interdicting Dominican migrants. Over 9,500 migrants were interdicted or forced to turn back.In addition to the migrant threat from these Caribbean countries, there has been an alarming increase in the number of migrants from Asia, most of whom are from the Peoples Republic of China. Very often Chinese migrants rely on well-organized, extremely violent, alien smugglers to gain entry into the United States. The living conditions on the vessels used to smuggle migrants are appalling, with overcrowded holds and unsafe sanitary conditions. In many cases, migrants are transferred to smaller pick up vessels offshore for the final ride to the U.S., or theyre taken to Central American countries and smuggled across the U.S. land border. Beginning in 1998, more Chinese migrants began making trips from China attempting to enter Guam, which continues to be a significant problem. The International Information Programs has additional information on Chinese Alien Smuggling.In 1999 and 2000, Coast Guard cutters on Counterdrug patrol in the Eastern Pacific have encountered increasing numbers of migrants being smuggled from Ecuador to points in Central America and Mexico. While this may not have a direct connection to the U.S., the Coast Guard acts for humanitarian reasons. Most of these vessels do not have the proper conditions to transport these migrants and lack the safety equipment in the event of an emergency. The Coast Guard works with the flag state of the vessels and other countries to escort the vessels to the closest safe port.Undocumented migrants continue to pose a threat to the U.S. today. While the primary threat comes from Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Peoples Republic of China, and Cuba, the Coast Guard has interdicted migrants of various nationalities throughout the world.Office of Law Enforcement (CG-531)Mission:The United States Coast       Guard is the nations leading maritime law enforcement agency and has       broad, multi-faceted jurisdictional authority.

The Falcon spotted the vessels and directed the Coast Guard small boats to the lanchas. One of the three lanchas made it back into Mexican waters, while the remaining two were intercepted by the Coast Guard small boats. Additionally, Customs and Border Protection launched an asset and crew.Both lanchas had several fish and sharks onboard. The Coast Guard apprehended eight crewmembers from the lanchas, who were handed over to Border Patrol officers at approximately 1 a.m., Monday.Historically, in January we see an increase of border activity, but we have already seen almost double this month than we had this time last year, said LCDR Darren Melanson, a Coast Guard Law Enforcement Officer. Tips from good samaritans are so helpful because it increases our awareness of what is out there.The fishermen who were apprehended abandoned their lines after spotting Coast Guard assets, and Coast Guard would like to remind boaters of the thousands of feet of abandoned fishing lines and the potential hazard it presents.Posted in Uncategorized |Leave a comment Older postsSearch for:  Recent Posts CBP Seizes in Excess of $400,000 in UndeclaredCurrencyCBP Officers at San Luis Have Busy Week of Arrests,SeizuresLafayette Child Rapist Arrested inTexasPinal County Sheriffs Deputies On The JOB!!..Truck Carrying Marijuana Crashes IntoHouseGuatemala army no match for Mexican druggangsArchives January 2011December 2010November 2010October 2010September 2010August 2010Categories ArizonaarrestsAssasinationsatfBorder EnforcementBorder PatrolBorder Patrol K-9border protectionBorder SecurityBorder SheriffBorder warboycottcaliforniaCanadacapturedcartelscentral americachild molesterchild rapistcocaineCochise CountyColimbiaColumbiaCorruptioncustoms border protectionDEADepartment of Homeland Securitydepartment of justicedeputyDeputy Purolldojdrug cartelsdrugsEric HolderextacyFBIFederal air marshalfloodFloridafugitivegangsgovernorsgunsGunshotsheroinHomeland Securityhondurashuman smugglingICEillegal aliens.criminalsIllegalsinvestigationJoe ArpaioJohn MortonJuarezkidnappingLarry Deverslaw enforcementLiarsMaricopa county sheriffmarijuanamayorsmeetingsmethamphetamineMexicomissionmost wantedMurdernapolitanonarcoticsNational guardnational securityNew Mexicoobamapaul babeuphoenixpinal countypossePresidentprotestersraidrapistreportersrescueresourcesrifleRio Granderobberysan diegosex offenderSheriff's Officeshootingsmugglingsouth americaStarr CountysuspectsterrorismTexastucson sectorTuson Border Patrol unionu.s.marshalsUncategorizedwaterYuma SectorMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.comNetwork Blogs Follow this blog Border Narcotics IntelligenceTheme: Twenty Ten Blog at WordPress.com.
