Tagged since November 2010.Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani (Persian:   , born ca. 1967) is an Iranian woman convicted of adultery and murder, and since 2006 has been under a sentence of death under in Iran. An international campaign to overturn her sentence was started by her daughter and son, Farideh and Sajjad Mohamamadi e Ashtiani, and it brought widespread attention to her case in 2010, when prominent media sources claimed that she was sentenced to be executed by stoning. Iranian authorities denied that this method of execution would be used, and gave her a stay of execution in September 2010. She was also found guilty of her husband's murder.[1]The international publicity generated by Mrs. Ashtiani's plight led to numerous diplomatic conflicts between Iran's government and the heads of certain western governments. Due to the reaction of the international community, the execution had been stayed indefinitely.[2][3]Contents1 Trial1.1 Suspension of the stoning sentence2 International campaign3 See also4 References5 External links[edit] TrialIn 2005, Ebrahim Qaderzadeh, Mrs. Ashtiani's husband, aged 44, was found murdered in his bathroom floor. He had been stabbed to death.[4]Mrs. Ashtiani had allegedly committed adultery with the man who murdered her husband, Isa Taheri.[5][citation needed] Taheri was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Under Islamic law, murder must be absolved by diyya or qisas. Mrs. Ashtiani's children accepted diyya, which is blood money, rather than qisas, which is retribution (execution). Taheri was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment.[5][6]In 2006, Mrs. Ashtiani was brought on her first trial, charged with the murder of her husband. She was found guilty of murdering her husband, and sentenced to death by hanging. Her sentence was commuted to 10 years' imprisonment after receiving forgiveness from her children, as was Taheri's, in 2007.[7][8]In September 2006, her case was again brought up in a different court, where this time she was tried for adultery.[citation needed] She pleaded guilty at the time, but later recanted her confession.[citation needed] She was convicted of adultery while still married, and sentenced to death by stoning, and an additional sentence of 99 lashes.[citation needed] Mrs. Ashtiani may have had difficulty understanding the case[9]because she speaks Turkish and not Farsi.[10] Malek Ejdar Sharifi, head of East Azerbaijan Province's judiciary said, "She was sentenced to capital punishment... for committing murder, manslaughter and adultery."[11] However, according to Mission Free Iran, an advocacy group, this is contrary to the documentation on Mrs. Ashtiani's case.[12][1] Iran's Supreme Court confirmed her death sentence on May 27, 2007, and her appeal was turned down.[6]The Press Section of the Iranian Embassy in London, issued the following statement on July 8, 2010: "Considering the statements made by the Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt on an Iranian national, Mrs Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, and her execution, hereby this mission denies the false news aired in this respect and notifies the Ministry that according to information from the relevant judicial authorities in Iran, she will not be executed by stoning punishment."[13]Following vociferous domestic and international controversy and outcry over stoning in the early years of the Islamic republic, the government placed a moratorium on stoning in 2002.[14] In 2008, Iran's judiciary decided to submit a new draft penal code to parliament for approval.[15] In January 2005, a spokesman for Iran's judiciary, Jamal Karimirad, was quoted as saying "Stoning has been dropped from the penal code for a long time, and in the Islamic republic, we do not see such punishments being carried out", further adding that if stoning sentences were passed by lower courts, they were over-ruled by higher courts and "no such verdicts have been carried out". In 2008, Iran's judiciary scrapped stoning in draft legislation submitted to parliament for approval.[16]As of June 2009, Iran's parliament has been reviewing and revising the Islamic penal code to omit stoning.[17] Reporters in Iran have been banned from reporting on the case.[18] One of her lawyers, Mohammed Mostafaei, fled the country when he was wanted for financial fraud.[19][20] Mostafaei sought asylum internationally, first in Turkey, and then Norway, where he was reunited with his family on September 2, 2010.[21]On August 4, 2010, the Iranian authorities told Mrs. Ashtiani's lawyer, Houtan Kian, that she faces death by hanging.[22] On the same day, Tehran's High Court rejected a reopening of the trial and instead considered the Tabriz prosecutor's demand to execute Mrs. Ashtiani. Her case was subsequently transferred to the deputy prosecutor-general Saeed Mortazavi.[23] Mrs. Ashtiani's son was told that the file on his father's murder case has been lost. Her son added that "they are lying about the charges against my mother. She was acquitted of murdering my father but now the government is building up their own story against her".[24] Her son's statement is contradicted by numerous news accounts describing she was convicted of both murder and adultery.[8][25]On August 12, 2010, Mrs. Ashtiani was televised from Tabriz prison on an Iranian state-run television program which showed her confessing to adultery and involvement murdering her husband once again. Her lawyer claimed she was tortured for two days prior to the interview.[26] On August 28, Mrs. Ashtiani was told that given the 24 hour notice that she was to be hanged at dawn the next day. She wrote her last will and testament just before the call to morning prayer at 5:00 AM local time, when she expected to be led to the gallows at Tabriz Prison. However the sentence was stayed.[24]Also on August 28, 2010, British newspaper The Times published a photograph of an unveiled woman, identified as Mrs. Ashtiani; the photograph had been provided to the Times by her former lawyer Mohammed Mostafaei. On September 2, 2010, Mrs. Ashtiani's son and current lawyer reported that she had been additionally convicted of "spreading corruption and indecency" for appearing unveiled and sentenced to 99 lashes. The Times subsequently reported that the photograph was not of Mrs. Ashtiani, but of Susan Hejrat, an Iranian activist living in Sweden.[27] Western newspapers said Ashtiani was then subjected to another round of 99 lashes, predicated on the mistaken photograph. However, Mrs. Ashtiani was again shown on Iranian television on September 15, 2010, where she clarified that she had not been tortured and had not been whipped as a result of The Times photograph.[25][edit] Suspension of the stoning sentenceOn September 8, 2010, Ramin Mehmanparast, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, confirmed that the government had suspended the stoning sentence pending a review of her husband's murder case.[citation needed] Isa Taheri was found guilty and convicted, and received 10 years' imprisonment after Mrs. Ashtiani's children promptly forgave him, sparing him the death penalty.[5] She had been found guilty of murder in 2006.[8]Mehmanparast added,[clarification needed] that she was guilty of both adultery and murder and that her case was undeserving of the international attention it had drawn. He said that releasing murderers should not be made into a human rights issue and called on countries criticising Iran to release all their murderers as well.[28] According to the human rights organisation Iran Human Rights, Mrs. Ashtiani remains in danger of capital punishment by hanging.[29]Iran Human Rights also expressed its concerns about Mehmanparast's statement about "Sakineh's murder charge being investigated for the final verdict". Commenting on this statement, the spokesperson of Iran Human Rights, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, said: "The fact that the authorities are mentioning murder charges now, could mean that Mrs. Ashtiani is in danger of being sentenced to death for murder". However, she had already been convicted of murder.[8][citation needed] France's Foreign Minister, according to Reuters reported that, based on a telephone call to his Iranian counterpart, Mrs. Ashtiani's hanging might be called off.[30] A human rights group claimed that Mrs. Ashtiani was sentenced to be hanged on November 3, 2010; this never materialized, and Iranian authorities clarified that Mrs. Ashtiani was "held in the prison of Tabriz and in perfect health."[31]Her son was arested in October 2010, after speaking to two German reporters, who he said had entered the country on tourist visas.[32][33] He was released on $40,000 bail in December.[32] On January 1, 2011, he was shown on television admitting he did not doubt his mother was guilty of murdering her father, but urged Iranian authorities to let her live.[32][34] He also said it was unfair that Isa Taheri was free.[32][35] Press TV reported that the deceased husband's "next of kin waived their right to retribution".[36][edit] International campaignMrs. Ashtiani's two children began a campaign to overturn their mother's conviction. In June 2010, they wrote a letter to the world asking for help to save their mother, which was then first published on June 26, 2010, by Mission Free Iran's International Committee against Stoning.[37] The letter brought widespread attention in 2010 as a result of grassroots campaigning through social networking sites that led to the letter's being passed along to mainstream mass media.[citation needed]During July 2010, protests occurred in Rome, London and Washington, D.C., among other cities.[38][39] Calls to stop her execution came from leading human rights groups Avaaz, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch as well as from several high-profile celebrities.[40][41][42][43] A petition was created in support of her release, and has been signed by several additional prominent activists.[44]On July 31, 2010, the president of Brazil, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, said he would ask the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to send Mrs. Ashtiani to Brazil, where she would be granted asylum.[45] According to the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, the Brazilian ambassador in Tehran was directly instructed to communicate their asylum proposal to the Iranian government.[46] Iranian officials responded by suggesting that Lula had "not received enough information about the case".[47] U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mentioned Mrs. Ashtiani in a declaration on August 10, 2010, urging Iran to respect the fundamental freedoms of its citizens.[48]In late August 2010, the Iranian newspaper Kayhan called Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the First Lady of France, a "prostitute" who "deserved death" after she condemned the stoning sentence against Mrs. Ashtiani.[49][50] Iranian officials condemned this statement and[51] Ahmadinejad condemned Kayhan's comments toward Mrs. Bruni-Sarkozy's as a "crime" and "against Islam" .[52]A resolution by the European Parliament on September 8, 2010, declared that "a sentence of death by stoning can never be justified". The vote passed by a margin of 6581, the sole vote against having been made in error and later rectified, according to the Associated Press.[53] On September 29, 2010, EveryOne Group, a human rights organisation based in Italy, appealed to the Iranian Authorities for an act of compassion for Mrs. Ashtiani.[54][edit] See alsoIran portalBiography portalDelara DarabiMina AhadiMarina NematCapital punishment in IranThe Stoning of Soraya M.
