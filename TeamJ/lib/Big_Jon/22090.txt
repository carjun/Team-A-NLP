Sarah Palins Homer Moment-DOh!  SHANNYN MOORE:  JUST A GIRL FROM HOMERSHANNYN MOORE:  JUST A GIRL FROM HOMERPainting a Red State BLUE, one stroke at a timeAbout ShannynMooreRADIO. ACTIVE.TRUTH.Posted by: shannynmoore | August 8, 2010 Sarah Palins HomerMoment-DOh!Im really proud of my home town. When I say, Im just a girl from Homer on my blog, radio or television show, I like to think its not so much self-deprecation as it is a friendly warning. When Palin signed off on her Facebook blog bashing Obama on Friday with Sarah Palin in Homer, Alaska. I laughed. Lady, if you think I give you a hard time, hang on.Palin posted:And here I am, thousands of miles away from DC out on a commercial  fishing boat, working my butt off for my own business, merely asking the  Democrat politicos and their liberal friends in the media: Whats the  plan, man?, and they seem to feel threatened by my question. So, Ill  go back to setting my hooks and watching the halibut take the bait, and  when I come back into the boats cabin in a few hoursStrange. The Palins fishing business doesnt include IFQs (Individual Fishing Quotas) necessary for commercially harvesting halibut. Her baiting hooks and keeping a manicure is laughable. Halibut are on the bottom of the ocean, hard to watch them take the bait. I hope shes got a crew license. (Shrug).Sarah Palin & company spent several days in Homer filming her Sarah Palins Uh-laska show. (Eyes rolled).On the public dock, private security patted down  private citizens. The Fourth Amendment protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure from their government. Private security searching private citizens in a public  place, doesnt fall under that category. Its a bit more hinky.Whether it was TLC or the Palins who contracted security, under what authority did they operate in a public location? Were they looking for weapons? Well, now  theres a Second Amendment issue.This is Alaska, we carry guns. You can open-carry or acquire a concealed weapons permit from the state. If you are a law abiding citizen, you dont even need a permit. Sarah Palin recently endorsed Alaska Tea Party Candidate Joe Miller for US Senate. His supporters carried assault  rifles in last months Golden Days Parade in Fairbanks. If weapons are good enough for a public parade, weapons  should be fine at a public dock.Maybe it wasnt about guns. Maybe it was about cameras. In that case, its a First Amendment issue. Whether Palin had a problem with the First Amendment, the Second Amendment or the Fourth Amendment, she contradicted her entourages actions at the Homer dock.Risking accusations of being all Wee-Weed Up, one Homer woman made a sign in her shed. She then took the 30 foot by 3 foot banner out to the boat harbor. It said WORST GOVERNOR EVER. Kathleen Gustafson is a teacher married to a local commercial fisherman. She felt like Sarah Palin had let the state down by becoming a dollar-chasing celebrity and ignoring the oath of office shed sworn on a Bible.Kathleen was motivated by the fact Palin was using the very place where her family makes a living to fortify the Palin personality cult-pretending to do the very thing they worked so hard to sustain. Initially, Kathleen just wanted to waste a little  of the camera crews time, since Palin wasted so much of her time purporting to represent Alaskas interests.She didnt imagine Palin would  be so easy to draw out.Saturday morning, Billy Sullivan helped Kathleen tape the banner up on his place of business at the top of the boat ramp. Then here she came. Sarah.She couldnt just walk by. Only a few fishermen and tourists would have seen the banner, but Sarah had to stop and protest. I spoke with Kathleen. She said she wanted Palin to know how she felt, but never dreamed shed get the chance to say to her face, Youre not a leader, youre a climber! Early in the conversation, Sarah actually winked at Kathleen in what seemed to be a case of eyelid Tourette Syndrome.At one point, a Palin daughter chanted, Youre just jealous. Kathleen told Sarah she was disappointed that she dropped her responsibility to the state to became a celebrity. Palin said incredulously, Im honored. No, she thinks Im a celebrity! Really? So the camera crew wasnt an indicator? How many times do you have to be on magazine covers to gain celebrity status? Something about camping with Kate Plus Eight in rain slickers seems, well, a little celebrity.Billy Sullivan caught much of the interchange on his cell phone camera. The back of her security guards head and Todd Palin attempted to block Billys view, continually rotating like Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. What were they afraid of? I guess thats what happens when youre filming a celebrity. He was even told by one of the Palin daughters, Youre an A-hole. Charming family values.I asked both Billy and Kathleen which Palin daughter said what. Neither knew. They dont have televisions and arent interested in Palins personal life and dramas.In what has become typical tragic irony, Sarah initially claimed to support Kathleens First Amendment Rights. But as soon as Billy Sullivan walked toward the dock, one of Palins entourage tore down the sign to great applause from her group.Todd Palin approached Billy (who owns a business called Dockside Fish and buys halibut on that dock) and asked him to get out of the Discovery crews shot. You just cant get enough of her, can you? he asked. An Alaska State Trooper told Billy he should call the Homer Police Department and report the trespassing and destruction of property.What the Palin folks dont seem to understand is simple; if Fred Phelps gets to hold his hateful signs up at military funerals, Billy should be able to put Kathleens WORST GOVERNOR EVER banner on his building and not have a Palin goon tear it down.The First Amendment only matters when you say or write something someone else doesnt like.For someone who doesnt hold elected office and denies being a celebrity, Sarah Palin may want to get a Constitutional Handler.Transcript of the video can be found here.Kathleens banner torn down, but Palin is still the WORST GOVERNOR EVER.Share this:StumbleUponDiggRedditPossibly related posts: (automatically generated)Homer Simpson Votes for Obama!

The message public figures give out is crucial to our young people and how they will  approach lifetheir own life struggles.  Mrs Palin is not used to allowing others to have their say from her facebook page, she knows not how to allow interaction or freedom of expression by tearing down signs and disrespecting Kathleens profession and the profession of millions of other teachers in the real America, by using disrespectful facial expressions.You dont get it Mrs Palin, youve continually disrespected the office of the Gov of Alaska and many have higher morals and ethics that we uphold no matter what the circumstances.. we stick in there, hang in there and complete the jobthis is a foreign language to Mrs Palin This is something I worked with my children on committment and responsibility to a team, when the going gets tough or you have to do something you particularily dont like you dont just drop out, digging in your heels is what makes you a stronger person, this is how we grow as human beings. . . .this is what America is. . . were tough.we dont take the easy road. . . .Mrs Palin has disrespected all who believe in committment and responsibility and who have toughed it out in our lives, Mrs Palin has taken the easy road(for lots of money) and let down the team of citizens in Alaska who expected committment and dedication when someone takes a public office. . . .she let down the team, this was one of the basic lessons I taught my children. . . .you never let down the teamBy: barracuda78 on August 9, 2010  at 2:40 amReply How rude was her daughter?  It looked like Bristol to me chomping on some gum.  Whoever she was she needs to learn some manners.By: Pat on August 9, 2010  at 4:54 amReply It was probably Willow. I expect Bristol is either waiting for her D&C or will be incommunicado for about 6 months.By: mlaiuppa on August 9, 2010  at 8:28 pmReply Speaking of rude and having class. mlaiuppa you lack it. Weve lost two and that is a very serious matter. Thats really sad, no matter whos it is. Thats the best youve got Pat? Gum chewing by a teenager. I guess yours is perfect. My daughter does nutty stuff all time. Its part of the learning and growing up process. She wasnt even involved in the exchange. You guys crack me up. Sarah has no political pull at all and she scares the crap of you. I believe she has no business being in any type of leadership roll, its the pettiness that amazes me. Gum chewing.. thats funny I dont care who you are.By: Jeff on August 11, 2010  at 2:55 amReply Jeff, did you miss the part where the family values candidate referred to the camera man as an a@$$hole?  Or the part where the big security dude kept inserting his bulbous head in the cameras way?  Or the snotty, Im so much better than you tone of voice that Ms Palin was using?In my opinion, Sarah Palin is a fame-seeking waste of space.  She doesnt scare methe people who follow her, fawn upon her, and think she is Gods gift to the universe are the ones who scare me.  They vote, you know.  And they dont seem to know or care that their darling girl uses the Constitution of the United States for toilet paper, metaphorically speaking, that is.By: ChoChiyo on August 12, 2010  at 9:33 amReply I am so surprised that she did not use this opportunity to do her poor,poor, pitaful me routine and those evil liberals are against me.Instead, she had a perfect opportunity to show that she supports to first amendment and leave the sign where it was.She did not. First she lied about her family business on her face book to score points against the POTUS and Democrats and then she allows somebody to tear down a sign that she does not like.Had that been me, that sign would have gone right back up and I would have stood in front of it.A-hole? Nice family values.By: Diane on August 9, 2010  at 5:46 amReply The lie about the halibut fishing is a special slap to Alaskans, especially commercial fishermen. I think you are correct about the reasons for it but it is the lie itself which makes my blood boil.As governor she did doodly-squat to resolve some of the long standing fishing issues here and threw sops at various groups to keep them occupied. Had she not quit it is likely her I-dont-do-fish-politics horsepunky would have caught up with her big time.She spit in the face of subsistence issues, tangled state and federal fish issues, and waltzed around blathering about her husband being a commercial fisherman so she just understood it allAnd now shes conning schmoes into thinking she is some hardworking business woman longlining out of Homer? I read some of the free republic types- they are eating it up.Pffft.Oh Whatzername of F(laming) B(ritches)- the day will come .Yes it willBy: alaskapi on August 9, 2010  at 6:57 pmReply Sarah has no regard for teachers.  And shes instilling that belief in her daughter.  Wow.By: To be or....What was the question? on August 9, 2010  at 6:50 amReply Come on, her dad and brother are both teachers. Theres no way she looks down on teachers. Its really clear in the video that she is a vulnerable woman JUST LIKE MOST OF US WOULD BE IN THE SAME SITUATION! She didnt know what to do or say and was stalling with each comment/question from Kathleen. Of course Bristol is going to be defensive and upset. If someone was telling your mom to her face why she sucks wouldnt you be upset too? Shes a teenager, give her a break. This family has to hear this all the time and they have to have their every move scrutinized in the media. I realize that this is the path they have chosen and Im not defending them, but saying that Bristol is disrespectful for chomping gum and calling someone an A-hole is saintly behavior compared with the youth today.By: SE on November 30, 2010  at 10:45 pmReply Why does that woman never seem to complete a sentence intelligently?  Perhaps her bias against teachers is the cause of her incoherence??By: aformerAlaskan on August 9, 2010  at 11:03 amReply Why didnt anyone call the Homer Police for destruction of their property?  If anyone else ripped down a sign off a private building, they would have been arrested immediately.Wouldnt that have been interesting news if Palins posse got arrested.  Now theres some reality TV for ya!  Betcha!But, for real, were seeing the infancy stages of a budding mafiosa.  This is what organized crime looks like.  An arrogant narcissist at the center of a posse of criminal thugs.  Kinda like Hitler, too.By: LuvAK*HATEPalin on August 9, 2010  at 11:12 amReply P.S. Shes only mad at teachers because of all the Ds and Fs they gave her when she was in school.How embarrassing.BTW, Shannyn, can you dig up those High School Transcripts?  I need a good laughBy: LuvAK*HATEPalin on August 9, 2010  at 11:14 amReply I agree! She is the female version of Hitler! She lies, twists peoples words to fit her agenda, incites race riots, unjustly attacks our president & his family, to name just a few of the hate-driving, hate-mongers actions. The video itself speaks volumes about Palins unethical character. As Palin tells Kathleen she is out there fighting for every Americans freedom, Palins thugs are trying to block the camera, thus denying Bill his FREEDOM to use his phones video camera. Had Kathleens sign said Best Governor Ever the camera crew themselves would have been filming the interview!! You betcha!! Regarding her grades, I really would love the laugh. The college I started from was the one I graduated; Magna Cum Laude. I knew I was responsible for my grades, NOT my professors!!By: lovewolves on November 21, 2010  at 12:57 pmReply One things for sure: after watching this latest episode of Wasilla Shore, its obvious that Levi dodged one hell of a bullet.

DoubtfulBy: Mark Slim on August 9, 2010  at 2:36 pmReply Actually, Palin was being challenged on an issue.  She was being challenged by an Alaskan citizen for quitting 1/2 through her term!  Every Alaskan has a valid complaint about that.Liberals attack their own all the time.  I dont agree with many things Obama has or hasnt done.  I dont always agree with Congress, or with the state politicians that I voted for.And lets not forget, it was Palin that went onto Billy Sullivans private property and started this conversation.  This is on Palin.Sheesh.By: LMK on August 9, 2010  at 6:06 pmReply LOL-  you Alaskan?Quits pretty big hereLike as in an issue we think Whatzername should be called out onor shunned forLying about longlining for halibut out of Homer to boost her creds as a real American isnt an issue?

What else did you get from her?By: Mark Slim on August 9, 2010  at 8:36 pm LOL-ROFLCome on over to my neighborhood and ask around about the big quit. Remember you will be talking to Alaska Dems, who are pretty darned conservative, a  Republican state Rep, and mostly folks who register as non-partisan and undeclared because they choose to stay unaffiliated (by far the largest blocs of registered voters in the state ). Ms Moores take on the quit thingy is very mild compared to the on-the-street takeEspecially since we had just had to put up with Whatzername playing political games with our vacated state Senate seat for most of session to the point the Republican State senators chastised her publicallyAnd spend some time reading the Alaska State Constitution . It is an interesting document in many respects, not the least of which is the full and complete affirmation of the US Bill of Rights in the form of inserting those rights in full text in the state constitutionWe take those rights very,very seriously and poor old Whatzername never has understood that except as relates to herself  especially as relates to the speech other Alaskans/Americans may make.Ah- and the halibut lieAs I have been hollering about that for a couple days before Ms Moore said anything pfft.Stuff up your ears with that cotton neighbor Ignore the whispers from Wasilla like we did until its too latethen come back and talk about issues.LOLBy: alaskapi on August 10, 2010  at 4:52 am News Flash, Sparky:It wasnt the liberal left that came up with all those ethics investigations.It wasnt the liberal left that accused her of stealing clothes from the RNC.It was the McCain campaign insiders who said she was ignorant and unprepared for 08 campaign.Just because you dont like the truth about $arah Pay-lin, dont blame the liberals for your woes.By: Ord Avg Guy on August 9, 2010  at 2:19 pmReply Newsflash.

I feel about Biden, Obama, Pelosi, Reid, Frank etc. as you seem to feel about Palin: that they are unintelligent, that they are not merely misguided by actually malevolent, that they are bad for the country. The difference is, Palin is a private citizen. Why are you so obsessed with her? Why do you spend so much time talking about her? She only has power in that she can control the conversation, and you are certainly little sheep, following in her wake.If she was so useless and unintelligent and worthless, youd think you people would just ignore her, Instead, youre magnifying her power to communicate. She got her message out in this video, I dont see anyone blocking the vid camera, and she comes off as gracious and personable, not the ogre you wish her to be. She even charms the lady with the classless poster. I have to conclude you leftists are mortally afraid of her. Im not a huge Palin supporter, but you have to love the way she pisses off the right people. Id love to see her elected president just to see your little heads explode  By: docweasel on August 9, 2010  at 5:50 pmReply Docweasel,  Palin is just sooo fake n so into herself and also annoying, aint no one scared of her!

Docweasel your just probably her relative or kids or might just be palin herself pretending to be not a huge Palin supporter   hahahaif you werent a fan of palin you wouldnt even waste your time sticking up for poor lil palin, by the way i wonder why she has sooo many haters in alaska oh and not to mension all over USA, making fun of her on the cnn news and snl, elsewhere, And she thinks shes all that, poor lil palin she jus can see it does she, she wants it sooo bad i guess, its to bad she wont!By: lin on August 29, 2010  at 1:02 amReply Stay classy Sara!

I have heard myself say time and time again the very words this Homer teacher told Sarah.  She let the people of Alaska down and she reacts rudely and disrespectfully to the teacher, as does her daughter as well.  Eye rolling?  Teachers are the backbone of our education system.  I wish I never had voted for her, but because I did, I have every right to complain about her rise to celebrity status and her abandonment of the Alaskan people.  She is only about money and facetime.By: Carey on August 9, 2010  at 8:34 pmReply So, Kathleen thinks Palin was the worst governor ever, but is upset that she didnt finish her term? Yeah, DOH! I suppose all other Americans have the right to quit a job, except politicians, unless they commit a felony. And the [not a leader, climber] comment, what a cliche. Is a General just a climber? Its called moving up the ranks. Palin was worth more to her party, causes, & finances as a larger public figure.Its been too cool for too long to attack Palin. Letterman bashed her nightly for a year, until he got caught whoring on his wife & child in his romper room above the studio, & the media let him slide.Im a libertarian-leaning independent, & while I dont care all that much for Palin or her family, shes better than the elitist ivy-league pigs that have taken over the Dems. As for 1st Amend, Palin walked right up to Kathleen & conversed with her & her sign. As for Search & Seizure, Ive been frisked 4X in my CA life by police, & Im a white college grad with no criminal record.

How can the general population not know her one minute and adore her the next? I bet that we could go to any American high school civics class and they would know more than Sarah Palin does, on a wide base of subjects.

Im having a PTSD flashback to 6th grade.the playgroundthe bullies/mean girls circling aroundAnd holy hell, that screeching voice and the balled fists.  Worse then Axel Rose hiting those high notes.  What a pathetic display.  What got me was not the eye roll, but the look of distaste and the exchange of glances with the daughter that  equated being a teacher with digging shiter holes.  Bitches.When my husband and I crashed her repub fundraiser when she was running for gov she gave us the same eye rolling routine in response to someones comment about greenies.  To much of this is why she is cross-eyed, you know.By: Runninl8 on August 10, 2010  at 6:39 amReply What would have changed my mind about her:Palin  I see your sign here, theres a nice little coffee shop we go to sometimes if you want to go talk somewhere.::looks at the camera guy::Come on along if you want::Tells her daughters and husband and body guards to go wherever they were going. Buys everybody a cup of coffee and a slice of pie::Okay, Im listeningKathleen  Well Im concerned that you left your duty being governor to go be celebrity. Im concerned that your private security force is searching my husband and myself while we just are trying to work. It just seems hypocritical to me. Also the way you wink at everybody makes a lot of us feel like you think youre better than us.Palin  Well I tell ya. Those are really good questions. First leaving the governorship. A lot of people say I quit and to be honest, I see their point to be honest. But the truth is simple; I had to strike while the kettle was hot. I couldnt do both.During the campaign, I became an icon for small government and I really seemed to connect with a lot of people. If I had waited until my term was up, it would have cooled down too much to do any real good with it. I am more valuable to the party as a republican celebrity spokesperson if Im out and talking with folks and getting people charged up than I am actually being a politican.To a lot of people that looks like I quit, and I see it, I really do. And its not really un-true.I believe Im in a unique position to really fire people up over the Republican and Tea-party messages, which I believe are very important.Now for the pat-downs. I understand. I really do. But the truth is, politics really seems to touch people in a personal way. There are people out there that want to do me and my family harm, plain and simple. I will not abide my family being in more harms way than need be. I know you guys are truthworthy, but there are people that arent. Im truly sorry about that. Well try to find some other place to dock.By: Joe on August 10, 2010  at 7:44 amReply But as it is, it just shows her as who she really is. An airhead who married an airhead and raised little airhead brats.By: Joe on August 10, 2010  at 7:45 amReply 27 yr old male from CA. Got linked to this blog from the Huff Post. Poked around.

Keep on.-AGBy: Andrew Goff on August 10, 2010  at 8:20 amReply The most bothersome segment of the video was the face Mrs. Pailin made when the woman said she was a teacher. What was that all about? Its true that most teacher unions support liberal candidates, so in her mind that negates the good work teachers do every dayeven in Alaska..By: patrick on August 10, 2010  at 8:41 amReply A disgusting human being.By: Runninl8 on August 10, 2010  at 9:09 amReply The face was an exchange between Palin and her family, because most of Palins family  grandparents, father, brother & sister  are teachers.  I doublt Palin thinks all teachers are government robots, especially in fiercely independent Alaska.By: Lizzie on August 10, 2010  at 11:00 amReply The daughter in the video is Bristle, aptly named.  See how her arms are tightly folded and her body language says it all.  Shes pissed off and disrespectful of Kathleen, probably because of the banner.  Palin and her kid are mocking Kathleen that much is for certain.  Palin is not only the worst governor ever but the bitchiest. Apparently the entire family feels that theyre entitled to frisk and sass the American people who happen to be on what they perceive as their turf. Give me a break.By: marjorie stout on August 10, 2010  at 9:08 amReply Kathleen Gustafson, one of my role models, used Palins energy (aka buying her way to the white house) bonus a couple of years ago to put on a show that raised over $5,000 for our local family planning clinic.  Thank you you Sarah for supporting comprehensive sex education and easy access to low cost contraceptives.By: joseph on August 10, 2010  at 10:02 amReply[...] And sadly, I give you the delusional conclusion: They claim poor Sarah was set up by evil Shannyn Moore (huh?). Yes, Shannyn Moore apparently has the keys to Palins eyes. Hey, Shannyn, Id be careful with those if I were you. Im just sayin. Putin and all. Now, maybe theyre mad that Shannyn wrote about this yesterday and posted pictures of the sign she says Palins entourage tore down. A sign on private property. Because, yeah, that doesnt strike me as super American. And it certainly isnt presidential. Shannyn reported: [...]By: Petty Palin Cant Let Go of Her Mean Girl Ways on August 10, 2010  at 1:21 pmReply I had no idea that Alaskans were lacking in a sense of humor.No one has ever called anyone an A hole,  but if its a Palin its tyranny  its hypocrisy.  Its not the Palins acting uppity its the rest of you expecting to have your collective a$$e$ kissed.It would be nice to see that same critical judgment turned inwards lets see some comments on how the other people involved, could do and behave betteror doesnt that count because they arent a Palin so they can behave anyway they want  they have rightsthe Palins just have critics.By: keyboard jockey on August 10, 2010  at 1:36 pmReply The more I learn about Sarah Palin, the more I admire her.  But I really have to wonder what YOUR motives are.By: Aletha on August 10, 2010  at 2:25 pmReply Mrs. Palin is such a strange case. I hadnt ever realized that folks like her existed until she popped into the national spotlight.By: Frank on August 10, 2010  at 4:10 pmReply Wow!  Did she really just roll her eyes at a TEACHER???  These under-paid public servants who take care of, educate, and guide and inspire our kids every day???  This might be the eye-roll to be seen around the world  Speaking of celebritiesI saw this on a Facebook post from my neighbor in Castle Rock, CO.well done Shannyn!  Thanks for showing this.By: Kristine on August 10, 2010  at 4:53 pmReplyOverheard in D.C.: Folksy AdviceWeve linked to you on DCguide.com . Could you put a link back to us?By: DC Guide on August 10, 2010  at 9:54 pmReply did I miss something important?  oh nevermind, its just our economy going into the tank and job losses mounting, and a President who needs Warren Buffet to tell him what to do..but yeah, lets focus on a youtube video of Sarah Palin on a fishing trip. Now THATS news!!By: andrew on August 12, 2010  at 9:29 pmReply I think all these people obsessed with government on any side have way more time than I do. Signed,an average mother of 3 who doesnt know how she got to this stupid blogLOL!By: KImmie on August 13, 2010  at 7:54 amReply I think more people should speak out to TLC about the absurdity of this half-term governor representing Alaska to the world on this television show. I just did. You can, too:http://corporate.discovery.com/contact/viewer-relations/By: Maria on August 13, 2010  at 10:34 amReply This woman is undoubtedly awful and possibly even dangerous if she would be able to gather up enough support around her.  Im writing from Italy.Here the news have been reported only by some bloggers.But basically according to an italian point of wiev.I mean :  they have written more about Mrs. Palin as an odd character than what the character actually did in this last chapter of the story of her life.The event has been simply reported more o less as a marginal (and even funny) episode of thuggery.Above all, a typical feature of American way of life has been completely ignored.Namely how deep-seated is, in the opinion of an average American citizen, the idea of private ownership so evidently violated by Mrs.Palins gang.And how deep this feeling could be, has been widely witnessed by the plenty of messages posted in this blog.Im rather more surprised by another feature of this clumsy raid.Palins clan has seen the banner as a personal affront.I wouldnt consider their reaction as mafia like (as some people has written above) but rather more similar to the revenge of some members of a primitive tribe in order to restore the honour of the whole tribe.There is something of ancestral, of primordial in the way they (they NOT she) face the enemy.Todd is grotesque in his attempt to prevent from shooting the scene.And the destruction of the banner seems more the collection of a debt of the tribes honour than the revenge of a mafia gang.Mafia only want to make money, the most it can and in any way.It makes its business doing horrible actual things according, when its possible, to its own symbolic ceremonial.Palin stupid crew just did the opposite.Their performance gave them a bad publicity and no economic advantage. In a certain way Mafia may also be the perverted and criminal degeneration of ancient values and apotropaic habits that a community deep-rooted in its territory, can share.While the former Alaskan first husband, Todd is only an important member of a tribe.Please dont let me be misunderstood (even because English is NOT my mothertongue).Im not talking about  Alaskan natives or stuff like that.Im only talking about wrong collective behaviours acted by single members of a community.And I think this is not accidental if it has happened in the only State with so peculiar geographyc and climatic features.Features that had been able to heavily forge, through centuries, the habits of part of its inhabitants. So the real crime is neither the possible disregard of some Amendments nor the trespassing and destruction of property ; in both cases big important Words referred to very paltry events.The true real crime is allowing such a social climber lacking of the fundamental principles of civics, to hold high public offices.My blood just runs cold when I think she could have been the substituteof a U.S. President old and not enjoying excellent health.By: Matilde on August 18, 2010  at 2:00 pmReply Sister sara of The North is a JOKE,,,if you buy it,,,its your fault.  She is a self serving social climber who only cares  about the spot light and how much MOENY she can stuff in her pockets.By: ruth on August 18, 2010  at 7:10 pmReply Well, I certainly did my best to make my disgust about Sarah Palins Alaska known to the Discovery Channel/TLC by expressing it through email here: http://corporate.discovery.com/contact/viewer-relations/I would encourage anyone disgusted by Sarah Palin and her gangs  Doh disply while filming for TLC in Homer to express their views to Discovery as well.By: Mark on September 3, 2010  at 1:42 pmReply So now Sarah Palin isnt a celebrity but a hard working fisherwoman? ROFL!!Hats off to Kathleen and Billy.By: Mike on September 8, 2010  at 1:02 amReply I enjoy the content of your blog site.  The last person who tickled me this much was Molly Ivins of the Fort Worth Press Telegram.  My kinda lady.  I want to put money where it can do some good.  You and your activities seem the place and person where I want to make an investment for the future of our country.By: Michael Petty on September 14, 2010  at 3:11 pmReply BRAVO! THANK YOU! The fact that anyone anywhere still listens to Palin and that anyone anywhere even pays her to open her mouth is proof of a serious under-education problem in our country.see/hear:FOX NEWS IS MY MUSEBy: wobbly ashes on October 27, 2010  at 3:54 amReplyLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
