I never liked Barack Obama but I defended him against the bull shit claims of the right because I believed it was bull shit and unfair:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1SrQiHHPAk I looks like the snake charmer is losing his charm and the fact that Corporations call the shots and that you and I are just little punks to the DC Machine is also catching on.As I pointed out in 2008 here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23XFP6Vdgvk There is another critical element to grasp. The Democrats are not Spineless they are operating in precisely the intended fashion and it has been like this for years. The Democrat power structure ensures Liberal failure by a crafty use of good cop bad cop strategy. Blue Dogs are an insurance policy against a Democrat majority. Lieberman is another play actor in the mix.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX!(edited as per DU rules) This is why NOTHING happened when they were a minority AND why nothing happens when they are a majority. It is as clear as the horns on Dick Cheney's forehead! Kucinich, Sanders and the other "radical" lefties are sincere but useless. Barack Obama is doing exactly what was intended of him.Please see this. It's us AGAINST them.We need a concerted independent movement outside of corporate media and influence and that includes MSNBC/Comcast and the rest of the actual puppet masters that are putting on this show. People like Cenk of The Young Turks, DemocracyNow.org, GritTV, GoLeftTV and MYSELF! Don't look to the puppet-masters for in depth information, Rachel, Keith and Ed can only go so far before they will get their chains yanked!Thanks for listening and please forgive the shameless self-promotion.Refresh|+13 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadK&RFiveGoodMenDec-17-09 06:39 PM#1The Original Thread Was LockedtheFrankFactorDec-17-09 06:40 PM#2What is the same post? n/tihavenobiasDec-17-09 06:48 PM#3No idea why such a thread would be locked.

Almost every one of the worst were in the DLC, and they took turns scuttling Democratic legislation and making sure Bush got everything he wanted. Only Ben Nelson was a consistent betrayal, but the rest of them were just as bad, just at different and really critical times.For years, this argument has raged on DU...do we actually need people in the party who spend more time working against the party than with it?  Do we need people in the party who make a POINT of denigrating liberals and doing everything in their power to shut them out?The answer is "hell no".I want a big tent, but not a tent that includes corporatists and turncoats.  No one can win a football game if the guy who INSISTS on playing quarterback actually plays for the other team....and that is what we have with Blue Dogs/DLC/Bayh's "working group" gang of 15, or whatever the fuck they are calling themselves these days.Cenk is pretty good....he usually speaks for me when it comes to political strategy.Got a suggestion, though, Frank.  It is DemocratIC party....not Democrat party.  Forgetting the "ic" may be one reason you do not feel well-received here.  You do not speak the language yet.  You see, Republicans started taking the "ic" off of the name of the party back in the 90's because it emphasizes the "crat" part of the word, which sound like "rat".  The use of the term, however inadvertent, is considered a slur against Democrats around these parts.Just a heads up.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|ToptheFrankFactor      (1000+ posts)      Thu Dec-17-09 08:29 PMResponse to Reply #815.I've Been Lectured on the "Rat" Crap Before...I find it emasculating to cower and respond to such an idiotic reaction but your are 100% correct.

Hence, a party of Democrats is a Democrat party.A party that holds votes and makes decisions based on the majority rule is a Democratic party. It is also ironic that Democrats are going to make the argument that the party in Congress is "Democratic" when they don't give a rat FUCK about you and your fucking majority! Look at the polls! This is the kind of chicken shit some people choose to waste their time on. Secret fucking handshakes? Oh, look he said DemocRAT!!!! He's a corporatist, Libertarian, Tea-Bagger, Republican. Really?

However, intellectual dishonesty runs rampant here....disagreement does not translate into a good debate because so many will look for something stupid like "ic" and dismiss you.  But that is how it goes.So you either accommodate that and thrive, or you do not and go someplace else.I am just the friendly little elf that tells you about the barbs and brambles of this jungle before you go walking into them.  It does little good to rail against injustice of the brambles if you wish to trudge in this jungle.

Then the drummer and I play with the original as a scratch, and I mix them.  Then the guitar players play over that (I have another collab band called MetalForceFive with two guitar players), and then I mix those in.  Then it goes to the vocalist, and he lays down his track.  Then the final mix is put to video, usually edited by the drummer or the vocalist.Not quite as good as playing together and feeling everyone's energy, plus you miss eye cues, but still it sounds pretty good...and we have a lot of fun in the process.We are really just recapturing our youths and pretending we are MTV-worthy rock musicians when we are actually playing in our living rooms.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|ToptheFrankFactor      (1000+ posts)      Thu Dec-17-09 09:34 PMResponse to Reply #2526.Great WorkYou guys have done a great job!I'd like to find  a dtrummer and bass player to do old zz top.

They are wastes of flesh in their positions as far as effectively serving the citizens, both of them. We know that the Bush administration's actions warrant serious investigation they did then and they do now. Barack Obama's not going to go there either. Why would he? That could start a trend in holding our leaders accountable. So far they're batting a thousand in the "fuck you I do what I want" game.Corporate power is THE ONLY benefactor from the 9/11 affair. I say affair because while I don't believe it was a plot it was most definitely the result of ignorance, arrogance and malfeasance that was a prayer answered for PNAC and military industrial complex. No formal investigation, blah, blah, blah. It's an enormous scam to anyone still in possession of any sense of common decency and logic.Do you really believe that American's are being served by these, our "representatives"? Please! Poll after poll shows the sane desire for a public option and even single payer yet look at where we are... and with a DEMOCRATIC majority?Why is Max Bachus in charge of the Senate finance committee? How did he get that position? Look at Barney Frank and Chris Dodd. C'mon man! This is a supreme fuck job. It's a Circus! And don't expect Dylan Radigan to expose GE and Comcast or any of the other real players, not to any effective extent, no more than play acting.We are balls deep in some of the most brazen face fucking of the America people ever!

LOLPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topaicram62      (1 posts)Sat Dec-19-09 11:36 AMResponse to Reply #3233.Looking for Progressives? I know where they are.1. GRASS ROOTS DEMOCRACYEvery human being deserves a say in the decisions that affect their lives and not be subject to the will of another. Therefore, we will work to increase public participation at every level of government and to ensure that our public representatives are fully accountable to the people who elect them. We will also work to create new types of political organizations which expand the process of participatory democracy by directly including citizens in the decision-making process.2. SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITYAll persons should have the rights and opportunity to benefit equally from the resources afforded us by society and the environment. We must consciously confront in ourselves, our organizations, and society at large, barriers such as racism and class oppression, sexism and homophobia, ageism and disability, which act to deny fair treatment and equal justice under the law.3. ECOLOGICAL WISDOMHuman societies must operate with the understanding that we are part of nature, not separate from nature.  We must maintain an ecological balance and live within the ecological and resource limits of our communities and our planet. We support a sustainable society which utilizes resources in such a way that future generations will benefit and not suffer from the practices of our generation. To this end we must practice agriculture which replenishes the soil; move to an energy efficient economy; and live in ways that respect the integrity of natural systems.4. NON-VIOLENCEIt is essential that we develop effective alternatives to societys current patterns of violence. We will work to demilitarize, and eliminate weapons of mass destruction, without being naive about the intentions of other governments.  We recognize the need for self-defense and the defense of others who are in helpless situations. We promote non-violent methods to oppose practices and policies with which we disagree, and will guide our actions toward lasting personal, community and global peace.5. DECENTRALIZATIONCentralization of wealth and power contributes to social and economic injustice, environmental destruction, and militarization. Therefore, we support a restructuring of social, political and economic institutions away from a system which is controlled by and mostly benefits the powerful few, to a democratic, less bureaucratic system. Decision-making should, as much as possible, remain at the individual and local level, while assuring that civil rights are protected for all citizens.6. COMMUNITY-BASED ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC JUSTICEWe recognize it is essential to create a vibrant and sustainable economic system, one that can create jobs and provide a decent standard of living for all people while maintaining a healthy ecological balance. A successful economic system will offer meaningful work with dignity, while paying a living wage which reflects the real value of a persons work.Local communities must look to economic development that assures protection of the environment and workers rights; broad citizen participation in planning; and enhancement of our quality of life. We support independently owned and operated companies which are socially responsible, as well as co-operatives and public enterprises that distribute resources and control to more people through democratic participation.7. FEMINISM AND GENDER EQUITYWe have inherited a social system based on male domination of politics and economics. We call for the replacement of the cultural ethics of domination and control with more cooperative ways of interacting that respect differences of opinion and gender. Human values such as equity between the sexes, interpersonal responsibility, and honesty must be developed with moral conscience. We should remember that the process that determines our decisions and actions is just as important as achieving the outcome we want.8. RESPECT FOR DIVERSITYWe believe it is important to value cultural, ethnic, racial, sexual, religious and spiritual diversity, and to promote the development of respectful relationships across these lines.We believe that the many diverse elements of society should be reflected in our organizations and decision-making bodies, and we support the leadership of people who have been traditionally closed out of leadership roles. We acknowledge and encourage respect for other life forms than our own and the preservation of biodiversity.9. PERSONAL AND GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITYWe encourage individuals to act to improve their personal well-being and, at the same time, to enhance ecological balance and social harmony. We seek to join with people and organizations around the world to foster peace, economic justice, and the health of the planet.10. FUTURE FOCUS AND SUSTAINABILITYOur actions and policies should be motivated by long-term goals. We seek to protect valuable natural resources, safely disposing of or unmaking all waste we create, while developing a sustainable economics that does not depend on continual expansion for survival. We must counterbalance the drive for short-term profits by assuring that economic development, new technologies, and fiscal policies are responsible to future generations who will inherit the results of our actions.The polls say so many people want single payer: I dare half of them to make a poster and put it on their windows, cause I don't see these "majority" people.  http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=293263660251&inde...
