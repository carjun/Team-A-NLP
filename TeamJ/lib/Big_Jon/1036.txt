Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz. in Tucson, Ariz. on Saturday, Jan. 8, 2011 after Giffords and others were shot outside a Safeway grocery store as she was meeting constituents.AP | BDNThis graphic from Sarah Palin's "Take Back The 20" Facebook page shows a U.S. map with the cross-hairs of a gun scope imposed over 20 Democrats' districts. Last year, Giffords had expressed safety concerns after being targeted on the map.  The man identified by authorities as the gunman in Saturdays shooting rampage, which killed six and critically injured Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., appears to have left a trail of bizarre and anti-government messages on the Internet.Law enforcement sources identified the gunman as Jared Lee Loughner, 22, of Tucson. Loughner, or someone using his name, left a series of postings and homemade videos that laid out a fervent, though largely incoherent, set of political views.On YouTube, Loughners profile listed Karl Marx and Friedrich Engelss The Communist Manifesto and Adolf Hitlers Mein Kampf among his favorite books. He also included high school English class classics such as To Kill a Mockingbird and The Old Man and the Sea, plus childrens works such as Aesops fables and The Phantom Tollbooth.In one video, titled America: Your last memory in a terrorist country!, a figure in dark clothing and a smiley-face mask burns an American flag in the desert. The soundtrack is a 2001 song by the band Drowning Pool, in which the singer repeatedly shrieks Let the bodies hit the floor!Another, posted Dec. 15, begins with a line of text reading My Final Thoughts: Jared Lee Loughner! What follows on the screen are seemingly unconnected thoughts about currency and dreams, and the words I cant trust the current government because of the ratifications: the government is implying mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling grammar.The videos also say that Loughner applied to join the U.S. Army. The Army issued a statement Saturday saying that he attempted to enlist but was rejected for reasons that officials would not disclose.Another video attacks the police at Tucsons Pima Community College, where he had been a student.School officials said in a statement late Saturday that Loughner attended the community college from 2005 until last fall, when he withdrew after disciplinary problems.The statement said that between February and September last year, campus police were called five times to deal with disruptions Loughner caused in classrooms and libraries. On Sept. 29, the college said, it discovered that Loughner had posted a YouTube video he had made on the campus.In the video, he claims that the college is illegal according to the U.S. Constitution, and makes other claims, the colleges statement said.That day, two police officers delivered a letter of suspension to Loughner at his parents house in a Tucson suburb.On Oct. 4, during a meeting between Loughner, his parents and college administrators, he agreed to withdraw, the college said. School officials told him he could return only if he obtained a clearance certifying that in the opinion of a mental health professional, his presence at the college does not present a danger to himself or others.Loughners troubled past also includes a drug arrest.The videos do not mention Giffords by name. They do not describe any specific actions Loughner planned. And they do not seem to link Loughner explicitly to any mainstream political group or figures.Federal law enforcement sources said Loughner used a Glock 19 semiautomatic pistol that was found with a fully loaded magazine that held about 30 bullets. He had another magazine that held about 30 bullets and two others that each held about 15 bullets. He also was carrying a knife.The sources said he was standing about 15 feet from Giffords and started running, screaming something. Then he began firing rapidly, pulling the trigger really fast.Loughners address is in a neighborhood of ranch houses and ramblers in a Tucson suburb lined with palm trees and cactus, just a few miles from the shopping center where Giffords was shot. By midafternoon, police had cordoned off an area of several blocks, as streams of reporters and other interested people rushed to the neighborhood.In high school, Loughner played saxophone in the jazz band, and his clothes alternated between typical Arizona high school fashions  shorts and a T-shirt  and Goth clothes. Some days, said friend Timothy Cheves, Loughner would wear long, dark pants with chains on them, and T-shirts with the names of heavy-metal bands.He wasnt very outgoing, but he was personable. If you sat down to talk to him, he would talk to you back, Cheves, 22, said. But hed get frustrated with people easily. . . . Hed think that a lot of people were just idiots.That included people in politics, Cheves said: He was like a radical against both parties. . . . From what I got, it seemed like he didnt like anybody that was in power.Cheves recalled one moment when they worked together at a restaurant, the Mandarin Grill, where Loughner was a dishwasher.I was trying to tell him, you know, you need to get your life on the right track, Cheves said. He believed Loughner was using marijuana. I was telling him about God and all that. And he broke down crying, and he gave me a big ol hug, and said, Thank you, youre one of the only ones that ever listened to me. Loughner never talked of using violence, Cheves said, but there was something there that wasnt quite right.According to a report in the Chicago Tribune, Giffords had expressed concern about being the object of a violent act. After being targeted for political defeat by Sarah Palin last year in a campaign that included a map with crosshairs on the targeted districts, Giffords told MSNBC, We need to realize that the rhetoric, and the firing people up and  for example, were on Sarah Palins targeted list, but the thing is, the way she has it depicted, were in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, theyve gotta realize that there are consequences to that action.In the hours after the shooting, Palin issued a statement: My sincere condolences are offered to the family of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and the other victims of todays tragic shooting in Arizona.Related articles:Rep.

Of course this would be pure speculation based without any fact and shaded by my bias, but what the heck..I will call it as I want it to be.AnonymousHe was like a radical against both parties. . . . From what I got, it seemed like he didnt like anybody that was in power. Seems like the the left wingers were a little over zealous Blaming the enemy in their posts on the original story about this incident yesterdayoh well, could we expect anything different? I also noticed that his friend in the story didnt say he talked a lot about Sarah Palin either, could they have been wrong about that too?I think its possible,  jmho.AnonymousIts pretty sad when you would obviously try to turn this into some political thing. No sane person from right or left would do this. You should be ashamed of yourself.AnonymousSounds like Lee Harvey Oswald. But then wasnt he in the evil Tea Party too?God STG, get a life.http://www.facebook.com/people/Cecil-Gray/1027119962Cecil GrayKelley was Giffords opponent in the election. He was a tea partier to the max. He held open rallies with guns and shot them at the rallies. He was backed by Mrs. Palin. Gifford had a bulls eye on her. Too much gun toting gun slinging rhetoric to dismiss it.AnonymousTry changing your name to SingleTrackMind.AnonymousComgresswoman Giffords IS a gun supporter.Heres a photo of gun supporter Giffords on a shooting range (holding an automatic weapon)http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1345413/Gabrielle-Giffords-shot-Congresswoman-fighting-life-Arizona-gunman-identified-Jared-Laughner.html#ixzz1AXZ330hsAnonymousExactly HOW does he sound like a Taxed Enough Already party member ?The shooter, Jared Loughner listed among his favorite books  Hitlers Mein Kampf, and Karl Marxs The Communist Manifesto.NOT even CLOSE to the Tea Party.Reality check needed.AnonymousThe well liked member of the House was one of the people on Sarah Palins Target List.  Looks like Palin got her wish. Its tome we turned the heat on the right wing nuts like Plain, Rush and Beck before we lose what little we have left of our freedoms. They are out to destroy America and are well on their way to doing so.AnonymousPrevious post disappeared.Paul Krugman of the New York Times suggests darkly that Giffords was shot because she was a Democrat who survived what was otherwise a GOP sweep in Arizona and violent acts are what happen when you create a climate of hate (those reponsible for such a climate being, in HIS MIND, Republicans).TBogg of FireDogLake wades straight in and blames Sarah Palin for the shooting because of a graphic of crosshairs placed on the districts of moderate Democrats who voted for healthcare reform. Was the Palin graphic clever? No. But martial imagery is standard political fare and, as Matt Lewis points out, theres no shortage of Democrats whove engaged in it. (VerumSerum has found a Democratic Leadership Committee target map).http://www.verumserum.com/?p=13647AnonymousThe woman was on Sarah Palins Target List. That says is all about the right wing nuts..AnonymousMaybe you should check out the target map put together by the  Democratic Leadership Committee ?google -Democratic Leadership Committee target mapAnonymousMaybe you too should check out the target map put together by the Democratic Leadership Committee ?google -Democratic Leadership Committee target mapAnonymousDepending on the version of the AK-47 it could be full auto capable or not.AnonymousThe article stated the gun was an automatic.

End of story.AnonymousThe article from a newspaper in a country (United Kingdom) that has outlawed private gun ownership with the exception of bird guns and historic firearms is not an authority on semi-automatic vs. automatic firearms.Anonymousnot in the least, thank you.Anonymousthank you, i am very happy with my life.Anonymousnot the Kool Aid Chronicles?

Without those books, he couldnt have been influenced by the TPAnonymousactually, I have Cannondale, a Giant and and an Iron Horse.  happy trails.AnonymousHe didnt have to be a Tea Party member to be influenced by their hatred.Anonymoushe didnt have to be a Tea Party member to be influenced by their anti-government hate speech.  Obviously this guy was a loon, but thats what I think of most TP folks.  Its just rant this.  Hate speech that.  I havent met a TP advocate who didnt need to wash their mouths out with soap.AnonymousIve seen that map.  It is a map of the USA with targets indicating which States the dems are targeting politically.  What Sarah Palin had was a PHOTO of a WOMANS HEAD with CROSSHAIRS on her HEAD.do you see the difference? I do.AnonymousThis will probably be another  case of someone who was given meds for mental issues and things went wrong. Seems to happen alot.AnonymousLink to what you state please.AnonymousGood one, probably your point was lost on her though.AnonymousPot meets kettle.AnonymousSounds more like a follower of Bill Ayers or George Soros.. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/magazine/15wwln_Q4-t.html?_r=1 There are alot of these radicals teaching our young people in out universities. These professors insight violence. The times we live in will bring these people out of the wood work and well see much more of this.AnonymousIts not an automatic, it was a Glock 19 which is a semi-automatic. Learn the difference before posting.AnonymousDont think you will get an act of contrition from her, she is incapable of seeing reason, just spouting the hate  she heard on Olberman and Maddow and from Kos.AnonymousGiffords district was targeted politically, not literally. This is obvious to anyone with a clue.AnonymousReally? Sounds more like a Daily KOS or Democratic Underground person to me.AnonymousHow sad that is.AnonymousCommunist Manifesto? Sounds more like a lefty. Obviously influenced by the hatred of Ayers, Olbermann, and Maddow.AnonymousAppears he was more influenced by the likes of Bill Ayers. Blowing up  government buildings and the like. But that was OK since hes a bud of Obamas. Give it up. Your Tea Party accusations from the start have been way off base.AnonymousJust ignore the fact that Olbermann donated to to Giffords campaign (leading to his suspension), that Maddow doesnt spout hatred, and that it was a Democrat who was shot.  right?AnonymousReading books doesnt make you a killer. He also listed Catcher in the Rye which just about every high school kid reads.AnonymousYou sound like a liar to me.AnonymousYou have no factual basis for this statement. Also, he went to a community college, not a university. Goes to show you have no clue what youre talking about.AnonymousYeah, remember that time Olberman declared that 2nd Amendment rememdies were coming and when Maddow put crosshairs over Giffords district? Oh wait, that wasnt them.AnonymousFunny before the Tea Party came along the libs were out calling for the end of Bush using their hate speech at any chance they can get but people like you are okay with this. An organization comes along such as the Tea Party looking to protect the constitution and you immediately go on the offensive against them. In this instance it seems like the shooter hated everyone, when he was pulling the trigger political parties didnt seem like an issue to him. This whole situation with the Tea Party and Palin have been pushed into the media but a few comments made by upset people with no information except for raw emotion. Hopefully Rep Giffords will be able to address all of us and give her opinion on the matter. In the end all that matters is the well being of the hurt and to show your support for all those that were hurt in this tradgedynot push your agendasAnonymousour favorite grizzly mamma took the photo down.go figureAnonymousAnyone with half a brain knows that Palin had targetted the congrssional district politically, not literally.Stop with the baseless Tea Party hate speech.AnonymousI think when people point out these crosshair maps, especially Palins, and these 2nd Amendment remedies to our problems, its not about whether its coming from the left or the right. Its about the fact that these pundits and politicians are acting irresponsibly. They are very influential people and it seems that they dont care that these messages could be being received by insane people. This sort of behavior is WRONG regardless of who does it.Anonymoussorry, i dont watch or read any of those (shows/sites).AnonymousSane and reasonable people understand that distinction, but lunatics, ones like this shooter, clearly dont. A crosshair map is irresponsible behavior, fine if you like Palin, but you dont have to defend every single thing she does.AnonymousDTOM was making a comment about the photo in the Daily News which shows the Honorable Representative from Arizonas 8th District holding an AK-47.AnonymousWow. Good one. Your mom help you with that?Anonymousit is not baseless to call TP folks incoherent.  its blah blah Kool Aid this.blah blah tin foil that.  cap lock. rant. rant.AnonymousSo why did the NRA give her a D- rating?Anonymousyou dont know the difference betweeninsightand incitelol.Anonymousbut does like to insight violence.  what a crew.  violent and illiterate.  a winning combination.AnonymousGiffords used to be a Republican, so what? The guy that shot her was a nut. It appears he shot her because he was crazy, not that he was a member of this or that political group. But so may libs here cant wait to accuse the Tea Party without any facts whatsoever to back up their accusations.Maddow doesnt spout hatred? I guess it depends on what side of the political spectrum you are on.AnonymousLunatics dont? Well, that explains numerous posts on this board.Dont blame Palin for every thing that comes along and the rest of us wont have to keep correcting you.AnonymousI disagree with you. I have no problem making distinctions of individuals from the whole. Also, Im not trying to say that the shooter is part of any political movement. I am however decrying those politicians and pundits who promote violence as a solution and anti-government rhetoric. 2nd Amendment remedies, a revolution is coming, equated the healthcare reform to socialism and to killing the country. These things have consequences no matter who they come from.This woman was targeted after she voted for the healthcare reform bill. Received death threats and had her offices vandalized. Its disgusting and its promoted by people in the media, indirectly of course. But you cant be surprised this happened when pundits and politicians WANT people to be angry and hate each other, hate the opponent.AnonymousYes, it is. Your hatred of the Tea Party spills out in nearly all of your posts. Seek help.StillRelaxinFact. This area of the country and this politician was targeted by a political party to be in need of political/personal change.  Fact.  Speaking to the passions of its members a political party recently has made frequent Tongue in cheek suggestions that people with weapons may need to use them to protect or Take back rights that might be or have supposedly already been taken from them.  Fact.  People who are mentally ill cant always make distinctions between making Cheeky comments and taking serious actions.  Is there a connection between this mans actions and recent inappropriate comments by politicians?  To deny such would be to deny any meaningful investigation.  Denying intelligent investigation would be like stacking crazy upon crazy.AnonymousYou dont know when to use capital letters or proper indentations.lolAnonymousIf you would read my posts more carefully, youd understand there is nothing to correct. Im not blaming Palin. Im saying shes irresponsible though. Most sane people can understand the distinction between symbolism and literalism. BUT, some people might not. Some people arent reasonable and do do crazy things  as we saw yesterday.AnonymousD.H. Lawrence wrote about Americans: The essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer. He died in 1030 so quote occurred a number of years ago.   Nothing has changed.AnonymousMy bad. Thanks for the correction.AnonymousTime to put all white, heterosexual Christian males on terrorist watch and no-fly lists.AnonymousIn other words, you charge is unsubstantiated..as usual.AnonymousThere has been no tie to the gunman and the prior break ins at Giffords office, as far as I know. Many GOP offices have been shot at, windows broken, etc. in the past as well. Obamacare IS socialism and WILL kill the country, economically.AnonymousNo it was Ed Schultz from the same network who said he wanted to declare war on Republicans and told a Congresswoman to kill herself.You guys like to blame the right, but you should look in the mirror.AnonymousThose in need of help, rarely think they are in need. Frankly I find their posts amusing at best and scary at worst. See the one the poster made at the top.Anonymousere is no evidence whatsoever that anything Palin has ever done is linked to the motivation of the gunman. ZERO. NADA. ZILCH.Until there is, lets stop the Palin bashing and the Tea Party bashing. You people are posting based on pure emotion and zero facts. This explains how Obama got electedStillRelaxinThis comment is innappropriate.  Those you note certainly are creepy people who often say silly things to mislead or stir up the emotions of their followers but I really dont believe they support people running out to kill those who have opposing views.  No ones Wishes have been filled here.  You should go in an delete your own comment.AnonymousThe gunman wasnt a Christian. He even stated online that he would not trust god.Paint some other group with your wide brush. Maybe youll have better luck next time.Mungo Munro>>>>>>>Cheves said: He was like a radical against both parties. . . . From what I got, it seemed like he didnt like anybody that was in power.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<    I am glad most right wingers want nothing to do with this kid. It is a refreshing change from the way many conservatives embrace the Waco wacko and the Ruby ridge guy who used his wife and child as a  meat shield.  Still he sounds like a Tea bagger with his blame everyone for the worlds problems except himself.AnonymousSeriously.that is what you take that as..Sarah targeting those states politically. Not wih a gun. If you go around spewing that stuff, you are adding to the the delusion of those who may be slightly paranoid and believe that Sarah meant a gun. Anyone who believes that is part of the problemlets get real here. And why are some people so afraid of Sarah Palin?AnonymousHe died in 1030? America didnt exist as a country then.AnonymousOnce again, I dont think youre reading my posts carefully enough. I dont understand your hyperbole.AnonymousIts not so obvious to those that want to continue the decisiveness that keeps people attacking (figuratively) each other rather than trying to work together to solve the problems WE ALL FACE TOGETHER.AnonymousOkay.  Just white, heterosexual males then.AnonymousI would take it down tooobviously there are people who are so fragile and on the verge of paranoia that they would see that as a threat. Actually that scares me more. Wowthis country is in for alot more violence. There is no common sense here. And why are you so intimidated by Sarah? she could shoot a grizzly, feed herself and her family if need be, cut a hundred foot tree if she had to to heat her home, fight for the rights of the handicap, and stand in front of millions of people and boost the spirits of the American people reminding them what this country was founded on. And hold her own in a public debate. Whats the problem here? You dont have to like her. But your hatred for her is irrational.Anonymouscuz i dont want to, not because i cant.Anonymousmaybe they outlawed them because they do know better.Anonymousim not that fond of progressives either, fyi.But i dont hate anyone.AnonymousI think it was just a typo.  He died in 1930.Anonymousmaybe your mom didsee, we can sink to your level.Anonymouseither way, it proves the point that terrorists come in all shapes and colors.Irony:  white man is a terrorist in a State that promotes racial profiling.AnonymousIll bet it was the music he listened to. No? Maybe it was violent video games. No? He could have been abused as a child. Wait! I know, it was Sarah Palins fault! Dont mind me, Im just trying to come up with as many excuses as I can, as fast as I can. Why is it that whenever some maniac goes on a shooting rampage, its somehow, someone elses fault?AnonymousThe TP claims to have people from both parties in their movement.AnonymousTP claims to have members from both parties.Anonymousas far as I knownow thats some solid substantiation.AnonymousI guess you havent bothered to take the timeto listen to Olbermann or Schultz.Have you bothered to listen to the leadersof the New Black Panthers or the communistparty? Have you bothered to listen to Van Jones? All supporters of the liberal left/dems.Or Mrs. Piven? Or Dorn? Or the call for Obamaneeding an Oklahoma City? The only peoplecalling for revolution in any of the mediahas been the left wing.Why is it not relevant that this nutcase listed the communist manifesto and mein kampf as someof his favorite readings? Homeland Security isnow saying there are ties to a group who is anti-semitic and he had a video burning the flag.These are not traits of typical right wingers.The left is so quick to blame Beck, Palin, Limbaugh and anyone who opposes them.The only ones always crying racist, homophobicand other such garbage are the left.When the media of the left wants to takeownership in their inciteful rhetoric thenthey can cast blame.Yet nothing points to this kid as being one wayor the other except some readingsand a weird video. But the left will use this as a political means to try to stop the speech ofwhich many Americans are agreeing with aboutpolicy.Until then, they should stop their angry whiningand look at this for what it is. A very derangedperson who committed a vicious crime andstop trying to pass the blame.person who committed an act of violenceAnonymousWe will disagree on this point. I own multiple handguns, rifles, shotguns, antique firearms and I have no desire to go out shoot multiple people with any of them. If people want to kill someone they will figure a way to do it. Dont have access to a handgun well fertilizer and diesel makes a fine weapon of mass destruction. Dont have access to a handgun well a knife will do the job just fine. Dont have access to a handgun well a car or truck will do the job just fine.If someone wants to kill someone they will find a way. Limiting access or banning something does not stop violence.AnonymousWell put. I vote as a conservative, but I do not support the extreme right, just as I think it is foolish to support the extreme left. We all need to meet in the middle to find viable solutions to the very serious problems that we all face in this country. The neverending amped-up rhetoric from both sides is not productive, it is just pandering. ALL politicians need to stop worrying about getting reelected and gaining more personal power and start doing their jobs; being the EMPLOYEES of the American people and representing their best interests as the PEOPLE see them.AnonymousFact  we dont know his political leanings.Fact  we dont know who he listened to or if his dog told him to do this.Fact  we dont know what politicians if any he listened to or respected.Fact  the investigation isnt 24 hours old and still in full swing and people are trying to make political hay out of this.Fact  to attempt to draw conclusions on information in the press is stacking crazy upon crazy.AnonymousDo you think you can hold off condemning anyone until the investigation is over? No one knows if he listened to anyone, was a member of some domestic terror group or if his dog told him to do this.AnonymousAbout as substantial as you slandering LePages cabinet picks without any facts.StillRelaxinPerhaps for the same reason dog lovers say that Pit bulls are nice and when they attack Seemingly for no reason, we shouldnt blame the breed but their owners.  No person or party may have been this mans Owner but the reality of what was going on politically all around him certainly should be considered if we are ever going to determine a motive for his actions or seek to modify our own behavior  to avoid future attacks that Seemingly occur for no reason.AnonymousWell Ive seen that people on facebook are already trying to put blood on Sarah Palins hands for some poster that has a bullseye or something on this womans district because she voted for healthcare.  I would say that is quite a stretch if friends are saying he didnt like either party and especially if he was reading Karl Marx.  Certainly a tragedy but one that some lefties seem to be ready to exploit for (attempted) political gain.  What I am seeing this morning reminds me of the attempts to blame Bil OReily for the abortion doctor death in Kansas City a year or so ago.    WhjatAnonymousYou only wish you were at my level.Anonymoushttp://tinyurl.com/369rug4Check it out. I double dog dare ya.AnonymousBecause crazy people incite fear in a lot of sane people.AnonymousI seem to recall a certain pilot dive bombing his plane into an IRS building and people attempting to link it to the Tea Party and right wing talk show host until his writings were published which showed he was anti-government and it didnt matter which political party was in power.AnonymousPersonally, I find your gloating disgusting. Also, why is it that you defend the crosshairs map as being symbolic and not literal, but you find the phrase shes dead to me to be literal instead of symbolic? You cant have things both ways, otherwise youre just a hypocrite.StillRelaxinFact- I didnt suggest his political leanings.  Fact- I didnt say he listened to anyone or his dog.  Fact- I didnt say he listened to any politician.  Although his actually having ears is proven in photos so its likely that he may have actually heard folks talking about taking up arms.  Fact- Not making logical connections in beginning an investigation would be crazy.  Before you go off in anger again please reread my comments and try to separate reality from the hostility that been building up in your mind over comments that Others have made.  Humm this scenario is starting to look familiar.AnonymousYet more generalizations from STG. I would certainly like to meet the TP advocates who need to wash their mouths out with soap because none of the ones I know would speak as you imply. On the other hand, I would never have guessed you associated with any TP members, but more power to you if you do.I would suggest, however, that you check out the Daily Kos if youre interested in studying hate speech.AnonymousWhos gloating? Whats to gloat about? Im merely showing you and your crackpot cronies here that the left tosses about their violent rhetoric as much as if not more so than the right. You people just cant seem to grasp that, or wont admit to it.Ask the BDN why it felt the need to mention the Palin crosshairs but omit the Daily KOS threat? Fair journalism? Hardly.CentaurmystJared Loughners political views/rants do actually have a theme, but unless you know at least a little bit about the history of the Constitution you probably wouldnt pick up on them.  His views sound similar to Libertarian.  The original Constitution he refers to was more focused on states rights than centralized federal government.  It also did not include a Bill of Rights.  As far as the currency rantingit is about our government spending money it doesnt have.  He doesnt approve of using US currency when the government doesnt have silver and gold to back it up.  Hes opposed to US debt.  Based on his videos my guess would be that his political views are more conservative than not.   I would also guess that he MIGHT have schizophrenia, perhaps paranoid schizophrenia due to some of the language in his rants.AnonymousIf you know of any direct ties, please post them. Im sure the authorities would be interested in your information.If not, then shut up.AnonymousYes, and most would!StillRelaxinWell it certainly is nice that those who investigated the guy you speak of here looked into All logical and possible motives and determined that he wasnt following any political party.  Do you have a point in making this statement to me?AnonymousI dont think that the left is attacking the right.  We can have civil discussions, but as long as you righties continue to suggest that the mainstream media is lying to everyone, you will be not trusted to learn the truth about certain news media that does embellish the truth with right wing ideals.The BDN is no more a liberal newspaper, then the NY Post is right wing.AnonymousFrom reading posts here over time, I see that often some posters here dont even understand the difference between literalism and symbolism!CentaurmystI dont think the books are all that relevant in this.  Yes, he read Karl Marx who was extremely liberal.  But he also read Adolph Hitler who was extremely conservative.  I got the impression that he just had an interest in history.  He had to have been into history in order to come up with those You Tube rants.AnonymousYa.. maybe he wasnt completly crazy.AnonymousYes!And words do carry weight and power; people need to think first.  There are unstable people out there like this killer , and although no one is saying that Free Speech and amendment rights should be stifled in any way,political leaders and others should definitely tone down the unnecessary and potentially dangerous vitriol, bigoted remarks, etc.  Those words do have significance; they can be for good or ill.  Someone can express their political views as Gabby Giffords didand there are countless remarks from people on both sides of the aisle attesting to her approach and how she was kind and decent to everyone.  She is the type of person and leader people should emulate.This tragedy should be a real wake-up call in that respect.AnonymousWe either!  And I read a few times written comments on Fox news siteno thank you very much!I watch those real liberal stations like ABC news, CBS, ,etc.  Have for most of my life and very satisfied with them.  I find they are much more fact based (and not entertainment). I especially like the human interest segments at the end.NBC has the Making a Difference spots  about everyday citizens across the nation and the good and inspiring work they do. Great!AnonymousPalin was never going to be President (most people could see that) and now her chances have been diminished even more.AnonymousHere is the image from SarahPAC clearly just surveyor marks, not a rifle scope.http://tinyurl.com/28tohwfHeres an image of a surveyors mark for those of you who dont knowhttp://tinyurl.com/2cqg9uwHopefully, this puts the loonie claims of Palins responsibility to rest. At least it should for reasonable people.AnonymousMore facts and information about this tragedy will come out as days go by.So far, it appears this murderer was an unhinged, very troubled individual who seemed to fail at quite a lot..kicked out of colleged, denied entrance into the military,etc.  Students and people who were familiar with him, say he was becoming more and more bizarre acting lately.  He had some run-ins with the law as well.I cannot get over how prescient Rep Giffords was..her concern over the vitriol (incl Palins cross hairs targets,etc. which she referred to).  Rep Giffords was/is so highly regarded for her dedication to her constituents, her civility, kindness.   Quite a person to admire, I would say.Hoping and praying for her recovery (likely a very difficult road ahead for her and her family.)So sad about the other people killed and injured. Horrific and tragic .AnonymousTotal BSAnonymous..kicked out of college,  rather.Edit does not work, and there seems to be more technical issues on the wkends, but maybe not.AnonymousYou are part of the problem with that kind of thing .. I have aright to my opinion, as do others.  Many share my view re Palin..many. Perhaps you are not very informed.  I wont say back to youwhat you said to me..once again, people can express their opinionsand that will not change. Her ratings have been going down steadilyfor quite a while.she has only her hard core right wing supporters,for the most part.AnonymousOh yes, a tea-party guy who is very fond of the Communist Manifesto, and other writings by Marx (not Groucho).AnonymousDon Coorough, 58, who sat two desks in front of Mr. Loughner in a poetry class last semester, described him as a troubled young man and emotionally underdeveloped. After another student read a poem about getting an abortion, Mr. Loughner compared the young woman to a terrorist for killing the baby. From the New York TimesSeems prone to outbursts.AnonymousLike when Obama called other Americans enemies?AnonymousLike when Obama called other Americans enemies?AnonymousYeah, Obama should stop calling other Americans enemies.AnonymousAnd the time Obama called Americans enemies.AnonymousThe shooter, Jared Loughner listed among his favorite books  Hitlers Mein Kampf, and Karl Marxs The Communist Manifesto.Yet, he never quoted these books or gave any indication in his other ramblings that he was a communist. I suspect he never read either, but posted those books for show purposes. Screwed up people like him somehow see themselves as enlightened and want others to see them as such.AnonymousYou cant act like the only possible influences are direct ones. Regardless of who he listens to, idolizes, etc, the real fact is that there are some very influential politicians and pundits who are promoting and inciting a hostile political climate. Thats plain and simple. Whether the shooter listened to those politicians and pundits is irrelevant because hes still operating in that tense environment that were all operating in. The shooters position on the political spectrum doesnt change that.AnonymousI posted the photo below. Your claim that it has crosshairs on a womans head is a blatant lie.AnonymousChristina Green, age 9 (born on 9/11/01), was killed. A neighbor was going to the Giffords event and invited Christina along because she thought she would enjoy it, said her uncle, Greg Segalini.Christina had just been elected to the student council at her school. Her mother said on MSNBC, I just want her memory to live on, shes a face of hope, a face of change, she said. Stop the violence, stop the hatred.AnonymousKeep trying to justify whatever you are trying to justifyit is not working.AnonymousI was agreeing with you. Obama should watch the inflammatory rhetoric, just like you say.AnonymousYes, the comment about terrorist for killing the baby.Rant after rant.a very unstable unhinged individual.Also, paranoia and hate of government and conspiracy theories.   Always a really troubling mindset with those kind of extreme views. Then add that to an already unhinged person, failing at much of what he does (college, etc.)Anonymous1/8/11Sheriff Clarence Dupnik of Pima County:When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol of certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is outrageous. And unfortunately, Arizona, I think, has become the capital. We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry.AnonymousI am not going to continue with your game. Take it elsewhere or tosomeone else who might think you make much sense.AnonymousHostility? Interesting choice of words. Where in my posts do you see hostility? Do you often see hostility in posts that disagree with yours?AnonymousA couple of things:At this point I dont directly tie the Tea Party to this tragedy. The only thing at this point that ties in with the Tea Party , to me, is the remarks of Rep Gifford herself (by all accounts a very intelligent ,stable, balanced person who would not even be regarded as a liberal)  She herself spoke before (the videos are there) recently about some threats and incidents at her offices and said something about concern with some of the Tea Party in conjunction with all that.  Something might develop from this, but maybe not at all.I do not listen to Fox news but of course there are out takes,etc. Saw on yahoo news and others:According to Fox news:  Suspect is possibly linked to the American Renaissance Group (pro  white)  This, thru videos posted on his MySpace & YouTube  accts.    The groups ideology: anti-government, anti  immigration, anti ZOA (Zionest Occupational Government) and anti -Semetic.Although I do not watch Fox news, there are of courseAnonymousIf what you read is accurate, then this will be a case of domestic terrorism akin to the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.AnonymousI have read it several places. If you want a link , I could provideit, but I think you will likely be seeing the same things, sooner orlater. What I quoted was attributed to what was said on Fox News.They are saying, at this point in time, possible links to thatgroup, based on things they found on his accts. with YouTube andMySpace,etc.AnonymousOn another note, while I am thinking of it, and just curious: Do youhave an opinion about the possibility (likelihood?) of the BDN commentpages going over to a system of bloggers having to use their realnames (apparently the newspaper in Lewiston and others are going overto this, according to some posters.)  How would you feel aboutthis.completely positive?  I have no problem with that on othersites, but from some of what I have been through on the BDN one(although things are better now than they used to be), and with someof the posters who get inappropriately personal on here, I am not sosure. It does not bother me that much , one way or the other, but justwondering your take on that.AnonymousWhatever. I just agreed with you. If you dont agree with yourself, I cant help you.AnonymousThe act of assassination is political by definition.AnonymousDelete.AnonymousThe act may be political but the motive may or may not be related to any current political party.StillRelaxinThe fact that you disagree with a common sense approach to investigation and you inappropriately insert unrelated thoughts into other peoples comments suggest to me that you are on some level Disturbed.  I chose hostile because the other options like disturbed sounded more serious.  Frankly people who express themselves here as such kinda creep me out.  So if you need to be told that your right, then by all means you are so right in all your endeavors.  I bet if you email enough papers then those conducting the investigation will eventually also come to see the error of their ways.  Multiple threats and acts of violence, no sir, no need to look or even consider any connection there.  Fools!  Their all FOOLS!  If only you could make them see the error  of their ways.AnonymousThe common sense approach to investigating any crime is to run down all leads regardless of where they take you. It is not to focus on one thing and attempt to make the facts fit what people want the outcome to be.That means if it leads to the Tea Party then that is where it leads. If it leads to some anti-government group then that is where it leads. And if it leads to the person acting on his own without influence from some one or some thing then that is where it leads.StillRelaxinSee you CAN make sense.  So what is it that your arguing with me about?AnonymousThanks cher but I found the same information and it was attributed to a Homeland Security memo. Very interesting stuff.AnonymousInteresting indeed.AnonymousFor people to make political hay out of a political act is at least one of the assassins intentions, to be sure.  It is unreasonable to expect otherwise.Anonymouspeople from both parties ?   Democrats and Republicans ?Be specific ?Anonymoushatred ????   good grief.AnonymousThe left, the MSM, the progressives are all trying to portray the actions of this unstable and violent individual as the direct result of the Taxed Enough Already movement.  Because of this, its important for his interests, his background, his activities to be known. The truth needs to be known, not the distortions and the rhetoric that are happening now.AnonymousThis Id like to hearWhy dont you list a few of those specific things about Progressives that youre not fond of ?AnonymousThank you. Saved me the time and trouble.AnonymousAlready Sen. Kyl has come out saying he shouldnt have said anything, wouldnt the Sheriff know whats going on? The spin begins.  ..  on all sides.AnonymousThat is what Sen Kyl thinks; maybe many would disagree.AnonymousIt would be interesting to know why the military had rejected him. It seems to be well known this kid was in trouble, yet he was able purchase semi auto weapon?AnonymousIm sure many do.AnonymousI dont get that eithernot at all.A lot of people get guns who should not.Virginia Tech shooter comes to mind.AnonymousI did not care at all for his language about the guns,etc. So glad he did not win.  The better person won, who is now fighting for her life.AnonymousHorrible.AnonymousI did not mean to respond to the post of that poster (error) .meant to respond to another. However the horrible stands.as pertains to Palin.AnonymousVery goodI am not a conservatative but agree with your commentsand is why I often admire our Maine Senators, and someone like Rep Giffords.AnonymousYup.we shouldnt draw conclusions before all the information is in.AnonymousYes, aviolent nutjobthere is no doubt.But he is like no left wing person I have ever heard. In fact , his rants against the government and immigrants remind me of what I read on these comment pages often from right wingers, not liberals.StillRelaxinConclusions is a word youve inserted into the conversation.  Ive certainly not made any conclusions.  We are free to investigate and discuss the obvious possibilities, yes?AnonymousThank the Lord you are not in charge of the investigation. You start with his writings, his post, his home, etcIf it leads to the Tea Party than that is were it leads. But you dont start there and try to force the pieces of the puzzle to fit what you want to believe.Just to be crystal clear, nothing should be ignored, avoided or denied it the evidence leads the investigators in that direction.AnonymousMichelle Malkin has a graphic that shows the U.S. with targets (archery targets) over certain states. At the top of the graphic are the words  Targeting Strategy. At the bottom are the words  Behind Enemy Lines and goes on to state that President Bush won 9 states by a margin of 10% or less.Before yesterday I am not sure anyone would have taken this graphic in a way other than a strategy to win an election.Not sure about you but I have never considered Democrats or Republicans the Enemyhttp://michellemalkin.cachefly.net/michellemalkin.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/demmap.jpgMaybe all the parties need to take a step back and re-evaluate what is said and how it is said.AnonymousCheesyDit is easier to admit that they are the crosshairs when they plainly are then try to make them into something they are not.StillRelaxinWho said anything about STARTING an investigation by searching for a TP connection?  That would be silly.  I suspect youve said this because If I had said that Id be silly.  Oh wouldnt you have a good comeback for that!  But I havent said anything close to that.  Prove otherwise.  So what does your pretending that I did make such comment say about you?  Manipulative?  Yep.  Some might chalk it up to dysfunctional thinking.  Again I think youre simply so angry and defensive that you no longer can talk or think sensibly.  Which is interesting because other than your false claim the remainder of your comment seems quite rational.AnonymousMichelle Malkin?  Oh, the conservative commentator, I think, I do notfollow her very often.Cross hairs over states.is that what they did with Bush too? Idont think so .will check it again. I think it is a bitdifferent.one is more blatant .No, I am not saying that things said or done to Bush were right andnever said that. But , you will never convince me of good intentionsre Palin. It just isnt going to happen. I have seen and read enoughof her, and I know what I think of her. (not good.)AnonymousThere you go again with the angry and defensive thing again.Rational thought and difference of opinion seem to evade you.Have a good evening.AnonymousDid you see this before, or is it just coming out?I dont condone it, but it does not show gun related graphics. I didnot like the talk of that Republican (Arizona) who ran against RepGiffords and lost to her. I do not think you bring up gun referencesto people running for office.  As for the word target..that wordis used often, and not just in relation to guns. I might say, Thebullies targeted the child they felt was different. That does notequate to guns.I think this direct reference to guns (as the Repub from Arizona,Perry said) is horribly irresponsible and potentially dangerous.Once again, I have never condoned anything inappropriate said or doneagainst Pres Bush.   That said, that does not detract from the concernof this tragedy.It would appear, at least up to now, that he was a lone gunman.adisturbed individual whose behavior had increasingly spun out ofcontrol recently. His rants on MySpace ,etc. are very erratic anddisturbing.StillRelaxinAll you had to do was cut and paste where I might have made a statement supporting what you say I may have stated.  That would have been the easiest way in the world to prove me a liar.  As you did not because you obviously cant, well guess we all know what that means about what we can take from your comments here.AnonymousNo one has called you a liar.AnonymousHaving trouble with this site. What I tried to type is this: jd2008jd,can you explain why Rep Giffords (a moderate Dem, once a Repub) spokeout against the Palin website (cross hairs) and expressed concern? Canyou explain that?Also, no, no fan of Malkin. (will leave her to you.differentstrokes) I dont spend time reading Maddow either for that matter.No, the last thing I read from Malkin, The noble Michelle Obamare her vegetable gardens,etc at the White House, left me speechless.Not impressed with Malkin at all.StillRelaxinProve that I stated that an investigation of this event should start with a look at the TP and I wont have reason to call you one either.  If you cant well I guess I dont have to.AnonymousYour words  My point has been that this is one of the logical places to begin asking questions.AnonymousGuess thats the end of Target stores and their logo!  Obviously this is ridiculous. Of course in the course of a campaign a candidate uses various means of targeting the opposition. Even wonderful moderates such as Congresswoman Giffords. Its a POLITICAL campaign for heavens sake. If one drew a circle around districts which were to be competitive SOMEONE would complain they were targeted excuse me targets. We all target  in life. We target our budgets, we target dates to reach goalsAnonymousYes, the word target  is used in many ways.  It is not always usedin refererence to guns. Not the point.Using gun graphics (cross hairs) was disturbing to Rep Giffords, whowe pray for. Sorry, I do not agree with you (but then) No, I agreewith Rep Giffords and others on this, not you.We all have different opinions.Good night.StillRelaxinSo youre admitting that you lied?  Based on your previous statements I didnt think you had it in you.  ONE of the logical places to begin clearly implies that its one of SEVERAL things to look into.  Keep looking, this attempt to support your deception has failed to protect your honor.AnonymousThis time, your argument did not persuade me of much. Once again, Inever talked horribly against President Bush (he was my President) asI hear many hear speak of our current President.Also, I am not a gun lover (granted) although I am for gun rights forthose who want to own them (lawfully.)  I have no interest in thempersonally.I do have a problem with people like Palin talking way too often togun references, and the way she does. (no, not on her show ofcourse.something I would have had zero interest in watching.)Once again: why do you think the very balanced, fair minded RepGiffords expressed concern re Palins crosshairs thing?  Thats okayif you dont answer. I am sure we see it differently, which is fine. Ido see it as Rep Giffords did, and have for a long time.Vive le difference!!AnonymousI have nothing to admit. I havent called you a liar. It appears that you do not like people with opinions that are different from yours. Hope you enjoy the rest of the evening.StillRelaxinBacking away without honor.  Well theres a name for that too.  Clearly your mistake here is to  frame your own arguments by making your own statements and then trying to pass them off as statements of others with who you wish to argue.  Thats dishonest, manipulative, and insulting to all who come here.  I do hope you have learned a lesson here, but somehow I doubt it.CentaurmystHe cant have been radically liberal because if he were he never would have tried to go into the army.  Based on his rantings I would say hes probably a paranoid schizophrenic that wasnt on medication and became psychotic.  The fact that he targeted a politician does indicate there was some political views in the mix.  He very well could have latched on to radical anti-Giffords rhetoric.  No politician wants their words/rhetoric to be taken literally but ALL public figures need to speak more responsibly because they ARE role models.  Politics needs to be run like professional sportsfines and sanctions for certain behavior.   As for the gun purchaseif it wasnt stolen or borrowedthere are always ways for people to get their hands on guns if they want them badly enough.  Also, if he does have schizophrenia, he is still young and it might be fairly new and not yet diagnosed or treated.  There would be nothing to prevent him from getting a weapon if that were the case.CentaurmystThe little girl that was killed was in the book Faces of Hope.
