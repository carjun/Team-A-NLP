Expect next year's sales to jump 20%!A Great Recreational Activity for the Whole FamilyWhile attending university in Oregon I often took my folding card table, tent, Coleman lantern, sleeping bag and tins of food and bottled water with me on my short trips to various spots on the Rouge River. I would set up my folding card table near the side of the river, get out my folding chair and lay the notebooks and textbooks on the table. Then I would start doing my homework.The first time I visited the Rogue River doing my homework for school a strange and frightening thing happened. I heard screams and laughter! The river was smooth and quiet just below my campsite. The screams and laughter appeared to be coming from the direction upriver. I looked upriver where the waters curved around a slight corner and entered a canyon covered with moss and dangling vines. Here the water was a rush as it carved its way through the canyon and over the huge boulders. More screams and laughter...I got up from my chair and began walking upriver to see if the source of the human screams and laughter were indeed coming from upriver. Indeed, they were. The noise the people were making had bounced off the canyon walls making their way to my ears. What I saw amazed me.There were six white water rafts parked at a small beach area in between the canyon walls. A full camp had been set up with tents, a cook shack, tables, portable leisure chairs... everything needed for a camp out for forty people for a few days. Several white water rafts could be seen making their way down the river to the campsite where other rafters were waiting in anticipation. The smiles of joy and yes, a little bit of fright covered the faces of the white water rafters finishing up the third of four legs of a five day white water rafting adventure down the Rogue River. Each night the rafting guide prepared hearty meals fit for a king; grilled New York steaks, baked potatoes, corn on the cob, enough to fill the stomachs of the adventure hungry rafting party. Each night there was a whitewater rafting river party complete with food, sodas, beer and wine. Indeed, these people were having the time of their life. Some whitewater rafters bring their fly fishing poles to fish. The river trout are plentiful. Some whitewater rafters bring their gold metal detectors. Catching some gold could be a lot more exciting than catching a fish. The river canyons are full of gold fever. It's just waiting for someone to pass by.Story continued further down this page.Tip: Ask your whitewater rafting guide to stop at the Galice Resort river restaurant & bar for lunch.

As the sun set and the moon rose over the tall pine trees of the Rogue River National Forest five campfires bloomed into existence. The fifty or more members of that white water rafting party were putting what appeared to be New York cut steaks on grills over the campfires for cooking. It appeared that baked potatoes and fresh corn on the cob were also on the menu as the rafting party cook began preparing the evening meal for the rafters. Soon after dinner was finished, wine and beer were distributed to those who imbibed in the spirits. Digital camera flashes to catch the memories could be seen as the rafters broke out into joyous song and dance. These people were having the time of their lives!There are exciting whitewater rafting river trips available around the world.

Some of the best fun begins after camp is set up for the night in a desolate river canyon buried in the depths of the forest.  Steaks, baked potatoes and corn on the cob are cooking and a bright campfire illuminates the happy faces of the rafters enjoying good times, food and beverages.
