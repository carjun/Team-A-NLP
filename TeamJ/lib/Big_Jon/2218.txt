Just as importantly we need to put the gun metaphors away and permanently."Olbermann continued, "Left, right, middle - politicians and citizens - sane and insane. This morning in Arizona, this age in which this country would accept  "targeting" of political opponents and putting bullseyes over their faces and of the dangerous blurring between political rallies and gun shows, ended."He concluded his special comment with this powerful statement, including an apology for his own actions: "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence. Because for whatever else each of us may be, we all are Americans."WATCH:Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyRead the full transcript here.

The real point is that Sheriff Clarence Dupnik has opened the can of worms and they are loose. The discussion of vitriolic rhetoric should have started long ago, and now is as good a time to have it, regardless of Loughner's motives.People need to realize that this rhetoric is not only fueled by ideology, it is fueled by money, fame, ratings, etc. Too many people are as addicted to this rhetoric as cocaine or heroin, and they are willing to pay money, homage and fealty for ever increasing purity and strength. Extremists who sell fear, hate and violence are nothing more than drug dealers trying to increase their profits, expand their territory and wipe out their opponents. It is not only a few crazy politicians and pundits who are to blame for all this vitriol, it is the people who consume it who are equally to blame.There is no need to blame this awful tragedy in Arizona on anyone other than Loughner to see that the issue of debate and discourse needs to be addressed and people need to do more soul searching than minimizing and deflecting.            kolotyluk: I think Keith Olbermann has made an very good point,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/kolotyluk/keith-olbermann-arizona-shooting_n_806311_73344473.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itsteeev3                                                    3 minutes ago (11:04 PM)                        42 Fans                If it weren't for vitriolic rhetoric, Newt Gingrich would have retired in disgrace a long time ago.            steeev3: If it weren't for vitriolic rhetoric, Newt Gingrich would havehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/steeev3/keith-olbermann-arizona-shooting_n_806311_73344852.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itBigleague                                                    8 minutes ago (11:00 PM)                        138 Fans                Now I'm not really that into Olberman even though he is head and shoulders better than anything on Fox and Limbaugh or Palin. I am going to say that I appreciate the fact that he came out to apologize for angry words he has said and if in any way they could have possibly ever contributed to a person's crimes. The others all just deny and say that nothing they could ever say either has any impact on anybody who listens to them (even though that is exactly what their jobs are intended to do) or that when it does it was not what it looked like or sounded like and they are not responsible in any way.

I also agree that TV broadcasters who seek to inflame rivalries into hatred have no place in our society.  I was once a regular viewer of Mr. Olberman, but I stopped watching precisely because I felt that he -- night after night -- spent far too much time calling people names, questioning people's honor and inciting hatred of those with opposing political views.  Though my political positions generally jibe with Mr. Olberman's, I still found his hosting of the show to be needlessly confrontational.  To be completely fair, Mr. Olberman is not nearly the only one who does this, since it seems to be the main way our "news" channels stay profitable.  But, I would respectfully ask that Mr. Olberman examine his own practices and techniques before feeling the need to lecture the rest of us.            kenhamlett: I agree with Mr. Olberman that violence has no placehttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/kenhamlett/keith-olbermann-arizona-shooting_n_806311_73343415.html                            Permalink                        |                            Share itsteeev3                                                    11 minutes ago (10:56 PM)                        42 Fans                I disagreee.

Due to the hateful political rhetoric, lies and distortions by the right, it was only a matter of time before some nut took it seriously.   The right will never admit or applogize for their part in inciting violence. They just do not have the same principles.  Remember, killing of Dr. Tiller, O'Reilly never really took responsibilty for his words.At the end of the day it is the fault of the shooter, but when political leaders and talk show hosts are IRRESPONSIBLE with their words, things like this will always happen.
