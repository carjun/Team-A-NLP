I seriously don't know what's going on here. Can I see the results of the checkuser? Throwaway85 (talk) 08:18, 3 December 2009 (UTC)After looking into this further, I came across this post on J.delanoy's talk page. I'm actually somewhat concerned about this. I've had (ancient) dealings with Nja, and he questioned my status in the past. If you look, somewhere a C/U was done on me in regards to Domer48, which came back negative. Also, check comments from rd232 on one of the first messages in my talk archive. I've yet to see what sockpuppet I'm accused of having. Furthermore, there has been no evidence presented of a c/u having been done. I'm concerned here. Throwaway85 (talk) 08:26, 3 December 2009 (UTC)This. Brandon (talk) 09:05, 3 December 2009 (UTC)The only thing I can think is that there was another person at my university posting on an/i at the same time. I'd still like to see the c/u, as I'm sure I would be vindicated. Actually, having just done a whois lookup, it seems that that is exactly what happened. Both of those IPs listed resolve to my university (of over 10,000 students). I'm not sure who technical reasons is, but the account was created today. I've been here since August, I believe. Furthermore, if you look closer, you'll actually see that we were on different sides in the discussion (of which I was not a part, save for one comment). I had not posted on Talk:Holocaust denial until after reading that thread, which you'll see from the talk page there. Prior to today, I had never posted on any jewish-related topics, rather my attention was primarily on the IRA page, although I'vew been branching out recently. Furthermore, I don't recall ever having any interactions with the people technical reasons had beef with. I merely made one joke in reference to crafty's tongue-in-cheeky claims of being in a cabal.It seems this has been a misunderstanding, due primarily to bad luck and to one of my fellow students having a grudge against Jews. I can't speak for them, but if you wouldn't mind reviewing the points I have made and reconsidering the block, I would be most appreciative. Also, I think it best to mention now that I would appreciate it if this comment could be deleted from the record after my case is reviewed, as I don't want to out myself. One more thing, if you could whitelist those IPs, I would appreciate it, as they belong to my university and I do a lot of editting there. I don't know what the proper channels are to request that, but it can wait until after my case is reviewed.Thank you, and I look forward to continuing to contribute. Throwaway85 (talk) 10:01, 3 December 2009 (UTC)One final note: While I don't disagree with the block of technical reasons, I'm not sure it's a case of deliberate sockery. He could very well have closed his browser, opened it again, and editted as an IP without realizing he had been signed out. Our entire campus is a hotspot, with dozens of access points. He could have reconnected to the university's wireless network and been assigned a new ip, or he could have editted from a different building, etc. Once again, block = yes, sock = not necessarily. If you check my history, I think you'll see that I've editted from many different IPs, all within the same range.This blocked user's unblock request has been reviewed by an administrator, who declined the request.

It appears that I was a victim of collateral damage, as I commented on an an/i thread started by another user at my university who was subsequently banned. The CU, naturally, showed us as being on the same IP range. No hard feelings, but I'd appreciate it if somebody could review the post I made here: User talk:Throwaway85. Thanks.Decline reason:Your request was already reviewed and declined, I agree with that finding. The IP and useragent evidence is convincing. Chillum 23:35, 3 December 2009 (UTC)If you want to make any further unblock requests, please read the guide to appealing blocks first and then use the {{unblock}} template again. If you abuse this procedure by making too many unconvincing or disruptive unblock requests, you may be prevented from editing this page as long as you are blocked.You know, a total of three users or IPs have used Firefox 2.0.x from your university within the last three months. You, your IP sock, and another person who created an account with it in early October and never edited. J.delanoygabsadds 17:36, 3 December 2009 (UTC)Wow. Check again. I'm on 3.5.5 and have been for ages. I did switch from Ubuntu to Windows7 a couple months ago, not sure if that entailed a new ff version.. Here's a snip of this screen and my about: [2] Or you could just look at the edits in question, look at my edit history, and realize there's no way we're the same person. Please. Just assuming the tiniest bit of good faith, actually look at the edits/editors in question, and ask yourself if we really seem like the same person. Then go back and read what I've written here. I'm not mad about the intial block, these things happen. But this is starting to get a bit silly. Throwaway85 (talk) 19:00, 3 December 2009 (UTC)Actually, sorry but I do think a couple of the computers either in the library or in one of the labs are runnning an ancient version of ff. Still, You'll see I'm currently on 3.5.5. I don't even think you can get ff 2.x for windows 7. it certainly hasn't been available for download since Windows 7 came out, and there's no reason I would ever use an outdated browser, with all of the security flaws that entails. Also, and I really can't stress this enough, I was on the other side of the debate from the blocked editor.Throwaway85 (talk) 19:03, 3 December 2009 (UTC)And, seeing as I have time on my hands, ask yourself this: Why on earth would I create a sock to start a thread on AN/I, about users I've never encountered, on a page I hadn't visited until after the thread was made? Look at what I posted in that topic and tell me that it was the reply of one of the OP's socks. This is just plain silly. Throwaway85 (talk) 19:33, 3 December 2009 (UTC)But hey, if you really want irrefutable proof, I can give you the netlink ID I use to sign onto the computers/internet at school and the contact info for the network administrators here. You can ask them if I was the one who was using those IPs at those times. Just give me an email address and I'll send it to you. Seriously, it wasn't me. I just want to get this cleared up so I can resume contributing to the project. Throwaway85 (talk) 21:55, 3 December 2009 (UTC)I don't need to ask your network administrators what IPs you were using. I know which ones you used. You have used quite a few browsers, including several versions of FF3.0.x and 3.x. You only used one version of FF2.0.x, the same one as your sock did. I conducted my queries based on my own initiative - no one asked me to look at you. Indeed, I did not directly look at you until I saw that you were editing from the same place as that IP. Before blocking you, I talked it over with another checkuser and he came to the same conclusion that I did. Looking at your IP information and your contributions again will not change my opinion, since I reviewed both extremely painstakingly before I blocked you. J.delanoygabsadds 22:59, 3 December 2009 (UTC)I'm sorry, but that simply doesn't ring true. My edit history has nothing in common with that editor, and, again, we were on opposite sides of the debate. I criticized him directly and called him a conspiracy theorist. If you are so certain that that editor was a sock of mine, then surely you wouldn't object to contacting an univolved admin and asking for a second opinion. I'm literally a 5 minute walk from the network admins' office right now. I can get them to send you an email with my netlink ID, my internet activity, and even the netlink ID of the person who actually made those edits. Hell, given that I'm pretty sure Holocaust denial is against my university's TOS, they could probably revoke their internet priviledges as well.Look, I know you're confident, but you're wrong. Please either take another look or have an uninvolved admin/cu do it for you. If I'm in the wrong, then surely that will be their conclusion as well. I'm telling you, empatically, that I am in no way related to that other editor, save for attending the same university. Why is it so hard for you to believe that two people from the same university, and thus necessarily the same IP range, could comment on the same thread independently of eachother? Throwaway85 (talk) 23:08, 3 December 2009 (UTC)Also, the version of firefox in question is the one installed on the public computers here. I'm sure I've editted from them at some point. If you want, I can log into one of them and edit again, then edit from my laptop again. Hell, I'll take a picture of the two of them next to eachother and upload it to photobucket. Also, I wasn't offering to have the network admins tell you what IP I was using, I was offering to have them tell you what students were using each IP. We all have individual logins, and our histories are tracked and logged. You will quite clearly see that I was not the one making those edits. Do you understand the concept of open wireless? You have thousands of students all using a limitted IP range. I wouldn't be surprised if we were using the exact same IP, that's how wireless works. Same IP, different port. Throwaway85 (talk) 23:27, 3 December 2009 (UTC){{unblock|I'm not trying to abuse the template here. I know what the IP and useragent evidence says. Of course it says we're the same person, we were very likely editting from the same IP as I was in the library on the open wireless at the time. I've explained all of this, and have offered irrefutable proof that I am not the same person I am accused of being a sock of. If anyone wants to provide me an email address to contact, I would be more than happy to have the network administrators at my university send you a message with the logs detailing what students each of us were. I know the checkuser process is usually very good, but in this case it returned a false positive. Please review what I have said on my talk page, and take me up on my offer to have my school's network administrators contact you. I am not trying to disparage any admin involved, or even the process itself, but a mistake has been made and it needs to be rectified.}}I'm kinda puzzled here myself. Is there evidence somewhere that's not visible on this page or via Checkuser? I also don't understand what's going on with Chillum saying "The IP and useragent evidence is convincing"; Chillum, not being a checkuser, should not have access to such evidence. As far as the Firefox 2 evidence, it looks like it that browser was used on exactly one day (local time, it spans two days UTC); the IP involved is quite explicitly a university library. What am I missing here? --jpgordon::==( o ) 00:09, 4 December 2009 (UTC)Jpgordon, I have no reason to doubt our checkusers findings, I don't have to look at the data myself as competent trustworthy people have already looked and presented their findings. If I get contrary information from the same or another checkuser then I will of course reconsider my position, however an IP and a useragent match is a very strong indication that it is a the same person. If your findings disagree with another checkuser then I will defer to whatever decision you two can agree upon, I have no objection to someone with more information coming to a different conclusion. Throwaway85, after you get a response one your 3rd unblock request I ask that you stop posting. 1 is enough, 2 is plenty, 3 is borderline. Chillum 00:26, 4 December 2009 (UTC)It's not quite that simple. He has used several other browsers as well. A few other checkusers are discussing this on the mailing list. J.delanoygabsadds 00:34, 4 December 2009 (UTC)Okay, I will leave it to your capable hands. Chillum 00:43, 4 December 2009 (UTC)I'm talking to the network admin people as we speak. If nothing else, they can show at what times I personally was assigned each IP, although they are not allowed to release the logs. They also are not allowed to tell me what student was posting as the other user, although if a violation of the TOS occurred, which it may well have, they will follow up on that independently. Throwaway85 (talk) 00:37, 4 December 2009 (UTC)What I've learned so far is that the 142.160 IP was from one of our labs. I was not personally assigned either of the two IPs listed on the AN/I page at any time, according to the help desk. They are composing a request that the network administrators compose a detailed log of every IP address I was assigned last night, and what times I was assigned them. Also, if it helps, I would be happy to provide my MAC address (in a private email) to anyone who wants to check the access logs of wikipedia.org. Throwaway85 (talk) 00:45, 4 December 2009 (UTC)Apparently, they can't look by netlink ID, but only by individual IP addresses. They've determined that I didn't use either of the two that were posted on AN/I. If I could request the exact IP address that technical reasons was using at the time he was blocked, as well as the IP address I was using when posting on that thread, they can say which students were using them during which times. There's a 3 minute buffer before an IP is reassigned, so there's no chance of direct overlap, although two users can use the same IP if 3 minutes has passed. Throwaway85 (talk) 00:48, 4 December 2009 (UTC)Your request to be unblocked has been granted for the following reason(s):Checkuser results not convincing enough. --jpgordon::==( o ) 00:52, 4 December 2009 (UTC) Request handled by: jpgordon::==( o ) 00:52, 4 December 2009 (UTC)Unblocking administrator: Please check for active autoblocks on this user after accepting the unblock request.Much obliged. This has been a trying ordeal, and I'm glad it's finally over. Thank you.Throwaway85 (talk) 01:00, 4 December 2009 (UTC)[edit] Perhaps this is what your looking for:Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee/Audit Subcommittee. Since most of us can't have access to checkuser info, these guys look like your best opportunity to discuss the issues with people who can truly grasp what happened. AniMate 02:35, 4 December 2009 (UTC)That looks promissing, although it is not any particular c/u's conduct that I take issue with, but rather the way in which sockpuppet investigations of large organizations with thousands of users on a limitted IP range are conducted. I don't wish to denigrate the actions of anyone involved, as, while they may have acted hastily, I believe they acted in good faith and with the best interests of the project in mind. Perhaps I'll take the issue up on the mediawiki checkuser policy talk page, here. Does that seem like an appropriate venue? Thanks for your input, Throwaway85 (talk) 02:41, 4 December 2009 (UTC)I still think the subcommittee would be willing to handle your questions or point you in the right direction. I'm guessing that since most of the cases they deal with involve an editor calling for a checkuser/oversighters head, this would be a welcome request. Worst thing they can do is decline to investigate. Also, I've dealt with J.delanoy before. He's one of the good guys and I wouldn't be suggesting any of this if you were out for his blood. Either venue will likely lead to your questions being answered. AniMate 02:53, 4 December 2009 (UTC)I've started a discussion here. I'd be grateful for any input you might have. Throwaway85 (talk) 03:15, 4 December 2009 (UTC)I just wanted to apologize for declining your unblock request in error. Our check users are a stand up bunch of folks who I trust, however they are human and make mistakes. In the same circumstances I would probably make the same decision, but that does not mean I don't regret being incorrect. I will be watching your discussion with interest. Chillum 03:38, 4 December 2009 (UTC)Thank you kindly. As I said earlier, I take no exception to the actions of any administrator or checkuser, as I'm well aware of the optics of the situation, and the great utility of the checkuser tool. I wouldn't even describe J.delanoy's actions as incorrect, merely that they gave undue weight to the checkuser results given the circumstances. Still, your kind words are greatly appreciated. Throwaway85 (talk) 04:19, 4 December 2009 (UTC)[edit] Your dealings with SlrubensteinHello. You wrote this diff [3] in which you spoke about your dealings with Slrubenstein and his misuse of tools. However, your editing history under this username shows no prior interactions with Slrubenstein. Which misuse of tools are you claiming? The above diff is problematic: please could you explain it? Thanks, Mathsci (talk) 07:41, 4 December 2009 (UTC)Sure thing. Right here: [4]. Also, I found his behaviour in the corresponding AN/I thread to be inflammatory and unhelpful. Best of luck to you if you actually try to sort through that mess though, it spans numerous talk pages, the AN/I thread, and my corresponding comments in the archive. Rd232 might be a good person to talk to in regards to the matter, also I believe Wehwalt was involved. Throwaway85 (talk) 07:49, 4 December 2009 (UTC)It wasn't helpful that you didn't provide a diff there. Your statements seem to have resulted from a feeling of injustice about a block connected with the editing of a Troubles related article. Is that correct? It was User:Wehwalt who undid User:Slrubenstein's block, a prior involvement not mentioned in the D4D thread. Thanks for that information. Mathsci (talk) 08:30, 4 December 2009 (UTC)My apologies. I was merely opining on my previous dealings with Slrubenstein, not filing any complaints about specific behaviour. Yes, Wehwalt undid Slrubenstein's block, the latter being in direct violation of WP:WHEEL, as stated under the ANI Defense heading in my talk archive, and corroborated by other admins. Also, my problem with him is that he reblocked me for an "offense" (see the archive for my feelings on that) that I had already been unblocked for, apparently without bothering to fully read my talk page, the only place where I could edit. He apparently formed his opinions on the AN/I page, and wielded his tools on the basis of those opinions. His actions showed a lack of the due care and consideration one would hope for in an administrator. Also, the block had nothing to do with a troubles related article; the initiating incident occured on my talk page. Now if you don't mind, I'm not going to say any more on the matter, as it's still a sore spot.Throwaway85 (talk) 08:59, 4 December 2009 (UTC)[edit] Garter SnakeAn uncontentious posting seems something of a rarity on this page, but here goes. Listing sources at the end of an article was accepted practice at one time, and is still used by some inexperienced editors. However, in-line referencing is the standard now, and is essential for article gradings of B, GA, A and FA. If you look at yesterday's front page article, Tawny Owl (one of mine I'm afraid), it should give you an idea of what referencing should look like. 06:38, 6 December 2009 (UTC)Excellent, thanks for the advice. I'll review the sources in question and see if I can bring the article in line with current style guidelines. Throwaway85 (talk) 08:52, 6 December 2009 (UTC)[edit] Closure and so forthI would rather he hadn't closed it. However, you've had your say, and another admin formally closed it, so I guess it is OK. Do you feel there is more to be done?--Wehwalt (talk) 00:23, 24 December 2009 (UTC)No, I'm fine with the close, I really didn't think it was actionable. Like you said, I would simply have prefered if another admin did it. I've apologized to Moreschi for any offense he may have taken. Thanks for looking into it. Throwaway85 (talk) 03:25, 24 December 2009 (UTC)[edit] RequestHiya, would you please consider refactoring this, to not include the "immature and petty" comment?[5] Better is to discuss someone's behavior, rather than trying to make judgment calls about the person's character. For example, you could remove the above phrase and replace it with something like, "Does not reflect well on you." Thanks, --Elonka 06:46, 31 December 2009 (UTC)Done.

If a new user is being outright incivil/disruptive/vandalizing, then report them to WP:AIV for quick administrative action. But if the situation involves complex or complicated matters like a heated editorial dispute between long-established users or someone gaming of the system (e.g. prolific sockpuppetry) ect, then a report to WP:ANI is warranted.

Throwaway85 (talk) 09:16, 9 January 2010 (UTC)[edit] Bat-eared FoxHi, you removed an external link from this article, pointing out that WP is not a collection of links (I agree, and since this is the ONLY link in the article, I don't see how it can be regarded as a collection) also that WP should not "be used for advertising or promotion" (which this link does not do....). I think the site is very useful for depicting skull shapes. Could you explain why you find the link offensive? cheers Androstachys (talk) 12:47, 10 January 2010 (UTC)Sorry, allow me to clarify further. There are a couple of issues with that link. The first is that the link is simply a hardlink to an image of a fox's skull. While informative, if such were to be included in the article, it should be uploaded to the commons and inserted as a picture. This brings us to the second problem: The picture is watermarked, which is a very good indication that it is not available for free use. Unfortunately, only picutres released under certain types of licenses are able to be used on Wikipedia. The image you linked to is certainly informative, and would make an excellent addition to the article, but it would have to be released under one of those licenses. I hope this answers your question. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. Throwaway85 (talk) 22:03, 10 January 2010 (UTC)I'm puzzled - I thought the whole idea of an external link was to give a reader further useful information, information which was, for instance, copyrighted and could not just be pasted onto the article. Androstachys (talk) 06:10, 11 January 2010 (UTC)You know, I've been reading it over, and I can't find anything that specifically outlaws it, although my understanding is that we shouldn't link to images in the way you did. I'm going to contact an admin who is far better vesrsed in these things than I, and see what they have to say. I apologize for the template message on your talk page, as I realize it was vague and didn't convey much usefull information. Throwaway85 (talk) 07:39, 11 January 2010 (UTC)I've started a discussion here, and I invite you to participate in it. I might well be wrong, but we'll see what the people in the know have to say about it. Throwaway85 (talk) 07:52, 11 January 2010 (UTC)User:Carnildo has mentioned that, while probably not a copyright violation, it is considered poor manners, as we are eating up their bandwidth without providing extra hits to their advertisers. It's generally frowned upon in the web development community. Throwaway85 (talk) 22:33, 11 January 2010 (UTC)OK, so if I understand it correctly, deep-linking is impolite because it bypasses advertisers. Presumably going in through the front door would be the right thing to do eg http://www.skullsunlimited.com/ cheers Androstachys (talk) 18:31, 12 January 2010 (UTC)That's my undesrtanding, although I never got a definitive answer. I say go ahead and add the link, as it certainly is informative. Be sure to properly label it, so people don't think it's someone adding random links (as I originally thought). If there's an ability to link directly to the page that contains the image, without linking directly to the image itself, that would be best. I wouldn't be surprised if you run into more resistance on the matter, but I can't see any reason why it would not be allowed. Good luck!

Throwaway85 (talk) 07:38, 12 January 2010 (UTC)[edit] Frederick II and the Kingdom of SicilyIf you need a reliable source about the central and powerful role of Sicily in the Empire of Frederick II, you can see "David Abulafia, Frederick II. A Medieval Emperor, Allen Lane the Penguin Press, 1988, ISBN 88-06-13197-4" that also was in the sources of the wiki article about the same Frederick II. I know very well this book because I studied it when I did my examination in Medieval History. Thank you for your attention.---kayac71- (talk) 08:55, 12 January 2010 (UTC)I'm not trying to say your are wrong, I'm sure you know far more about the subject than I do. I'm simply saying that the language you chose needs to be directly sourced, otherwise it violates WP:OR and possibly WP:NPOV. Please don't take offense to my reverts, they were nothing personal. Throwaway85 (talk) 08:58, 12 January 2010 (UTC)During that time the Kingdom of Sicily created one of the first relatively modern bureaucracy and so it was one of the first well ruled states in Europe, it also has a very flourishing agriculture and was at the center of the Mediterranean trade; thus permitted at Frederick II to have a solid base for his imperial policy. The book of Abulafia that I nominated above affirms exactly the same. Thank you.---kayac71- (talk) 09:08, 12 January 2010 (UTC)That's perfectly fine. Please be sure to properly cite any and all additions. Let me know if you need a hand. Throwaway85 (talk) 09:10, 12 January 2010 (UTC)[edit] Noob tubeI have declined your PROD on this article because it has previously been PRODded and declined. I raised the original PROD so I support its deletion; this is purely procedural. I have not had time to take the article to AfD, but this is clearly the next step. I42 (talk)I was just about to ask you about that. I've seen CSDs go through on pages with more value. I'll look into AfD. Thanks Throwaway85 (talk) 11:06, 12 January 2010 (UTC)AfD raised now. I42 (talk) 11:10, 12 January 2010 (UTC)Well that was fast. Thanks.

Cheers, NJA (t/c) 12:29, 2 February 2010 (UTC)Cheers, appreciate the heads up. When I saw the name of article and the multiple people reverting, in addition to the 3RR vio, I thought it was a 4chan vandal. My bad. Thanks again. Throwaway85 (talk) 12:36, 2 February 2010 (UTC)Not an issue at all, I thought the same at first and I just wanted you to know. Doesn't mean their 3RR and attitude should be ignored however (reported to WP:AN3).

I'd be happy to pass opinion if required/requested but I don't think that my view on the situation is markedly different than any other 'pro-imager' so I'm happy to let the mediation run it's course and see what happens.

My friend Mountain Girl 77 and i need some help. We would like to make an article on our school, Eagle County Charter Academy. Could you give us some advice?;)CamrynRocks! (talk) 18:04, 23 May 2010 (UTC)I think that's a great idea! The first thing you want to do is gather sources. If your school is mentioned in newspapers, or on news websites, that would be great place to start. You'll also want to go over your school's website to gather information about how many students it has, who the faculty and administrators are, and the like. Try asking your principal if your school has ever received any awards, I'm sure they'd love to have that in the article!Once you've gotten all of the information that you want to say, and can source it, then it's time to write. Check out some articles on other, similar schools to see what they say and how they're written, then try and copy that.I would love to help you write it, but unfortunately I'm travelling in South America right now, so I don't have regular access to a computer. Fortunately, Wehwalt, who you know, is widely recognized by the community as one of our best article writers. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to give you a hand.Good luck with the article, and let me know if there's anything else you need! I think it's great that you're going to write, and I wish you the best of luck!Throwaway85 (talk) 19:03, 31 May 2010 (UTC)Very flattering. I'm happy to help, but Camryn and her friend need to start the article (I've given very similar suggestions as to how) and I will be happy to look it over and smooth out the problems.--Wehwalt (talk) 19:25, 31 May 2010 (UTC)[edit] Contemporary media reporting on the HolocaustGlad to see some support for the idea of having such an article, I'm also interested in working on it once the AfD is over and the dust settles. Fences&Windows 18:18, 26 June 2010 (UTC)I think it just makes sense. I'm on the road atm, so I'll be limitted to finding information available online, but it certainly seems both doable and desirable. Throwaway85 (talk) 20:10, 27 June 2010 (UTC)[edit] ==Before accusing me of something, you should check what you are saying. I have not violated anything, since i have been repetetly insulted, threated by that user. I came to request an intervention after days and days of harassment, violent threats and insults. I have never been warned or blocked or anything here. I virtually have no activity in Wikipedia except for my userpage. Anybody who is tempering my entries and/or stealing my identity is commiting a serious violation. Now i understand the dozens of threats made by that user when he says "he and his team" will continue to vandalise my page forever , i didn t understand which team, but now I start to get an idea about his "contacts". That 's absolutely shameful, after been insulted, my page vandalised dozens of times, violently threated, one people came saying it was me not him. I requested an investigation and answered about that. It is becoming clear to me now who are the "friends" of that user, tempering my identity and fabricate false accusations. Remember the rules say any editor, active or less active, administrator or just IP editors are all the same, there are not class A or class B users. Maxcrc (talk) 16:14, 18 July 2010 (UTC)[edit] =[edit] BarryispuzzledHere is the link to the Barryispuzzled archive: [[6]]. It's obvious from his edits, his pointed attacks on me in particular, and (for a "new" editor) from his familiarity with editing practices and linking formats that this is Barry trying again to disrupt things. Once you see the archive (and the other two cases involving scores of socks, you will draw the same conclusion. Smatprt (talk) 22:16, 21 August 2010 (UTC)Doesn't matter, you still can't assume they are a sockpuppet and remove their contributions without a finding of such. If you believe it to be true, take your supporting diffs to WP:SPI. Throwaway85 (talk) 23:34, 21 August 2010 (UTC)I knew that the links didn't mention him, they were provided as context for Smatprt's actions.

Throwaway85 (talk) 20:31, 23 August 2010 (UTC)[edit] SockpuppetingStrange that supporting a candidate based on his shameless arrogance and slimey, weaselly nature should draw such an earnest, good-faith response as yours. But looking over the other supports, it seems mine isn't even the most ridiculous - oh well:( Badger Drink (talk) 11:33, 25 August 2010 (UTC)I agree (sincerely) that this user is good natured.

FranceIsHog (talk) 11:38, 25 August 2010 (UTC)(ec)Actually, now that you point it out, I must have been rather absent-minded when I wrote that and completely missed the tone of your comment. Also, there are ways to express one's disapproval of a candidate without calling them shamelessly arrogant, slimy, and weaselly. Please reconsider your word choice in the future.
