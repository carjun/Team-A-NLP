What is a Hick, one thing I can talk about with some authority is hillbillies, hill jacks, rednecks, hicks and funny related stuff. I came from a long line of folks down yonder in Arkansas where my Dad was born and raised. Some of um cuter than a speckled pup wise sum of um looks like they dun went and fell out the ugly tree hittin ever branch on the ways down.Weeze from a few other places but I'm not gonna mention them cause I don't wanna get a whooopin! Now I often talk about my real roots you know my dna and xyz and all but as my daughter often reminds me its were your raised and get your up bringing that most influences you.  What the hick funny hillbilly redneck sayings jokes and giftsWhat the hick funny hillbilly redneck sayings jokes and giftsI now live in Ohio now and it is very different from the more southern experiences of my childhood. I often take great pleasure in anything reminding me of laid back southern ways. Ohio lacks what's great about the south. They wouldnt admit it but what the HICK do they know. Ive decided to write down all the funny stuff I remember from my childhood southern influences and such experiences. These are the kind of things you just dont say around Ohio or you run the risk of being frowned at as an out cast, after all they may really think your daft. Cuz well you know thays caint take a joke.Its like a funny dark side those havin an inner hick, redneck or hillbilly laugh about and those who havent laugh about as well. But the bottom line is laughter is the best medicine and Im sure its something every hick, hillbilly or redneck can be proud of. So I'm gunna take you back to when heck was a pup and ever porch swang wuz in the good company of a big ole Mason Jar filled to the brim with some of Momma's good ole sweet tea.What the hick funny hillbilly redneck sayings jokes and giftsLarry the Cable Guy: Morning ConstitutionsAmazon Price: $7.69List Price: $19.98Tailgate PartyAmazon Price: $7.97List Price: $19.95Larry The Cable Guy - Git-R-DoneAmazon Price: $2.00List Price: $14.99Larry the Cable Guy - Health InspectorAmazon Price: $4.24List Price: $14.98The Best ofAmazon Price: $6.53List Price: $11.98Larry the Cable Guy's Christmas SpectacularAmazon Price: $3.75List Price: $9.95Do You Have a Hillbilly Bone Down Deep Inside?

Now heck fire yuns know I dont cuss cuz Ive never wanted my two little girls to cuss.

Now yous may as well know i growed up with three rotten brothers and that be the reason I'm meaner than a striped ass snake, so forgive me if I get a bit rascally... Well the memories of my brothers forever blowing bubbles is the reason I became famous for using other creative terms to cuss and well my daughters have learned that instead. My daughter came up with what the cheese, "what the flip", "cheeze it" instead of the other more commonly heard phrases. Today we were driving to the store and she saw something odd and said a new one. Id like to take this opportunity to introduce the new phrase my daughter just invented today, What thehick 4-10-10 I loved it and claimed Im gonna use that for my sayings hub.

Cooter Brown supposedly lived on the line which divided the North and South during the American Civil War, making him eligible for military draft by either side. He had family on both sides of the line, so he did not want to fight in the war. He decided to get drunk and stay drunk for the duration of the war so that he would be seen as useless for military purposes and would not be drafted.Now if that ain't finer than a frog hair split four ways!katiem26 months ago Crys K. I'm so EXCITED to now know who Cooter Brown is!  Thank you Thank YOU THANK YOU!  This is a great story.  I'm so thankful that you left such a cool comment that has added a great deal to this Hillbilly Tribute.

Thanks :)akirchner5 months ago Hi Katie - I don't know HOW I missed this! Especially since I went from city slicker to redneck dweller 6 years ago this week!  I have certainly had quite an edurkachun since I done moved here! Seriously, it has it's moments when I would like to scream and run from this town to a more 'civilized' place but alas the housing market I think will hold us here for a bit yet.I get a lot of new material living here though - but then I worry that if I post too much of it, the good old folks (all 11,000 of them) will figure out I'm poking fun of them and really be layin' for me! (That is if most of them can read - I'm so bad!)katiem25 months ago Oh dear Akirchner I do know what you mean, my being one who's moved from it to the city well... we can go on a bit about it.  Don't know exactly why but we city slickers do like to look back and laugh on our inner hillbilly, it makes for great material.  You really must work on a hub, just keep it under wraps for a while and do it well, you might be surprised and find they too like to laugh at themselves, besides rarely do folks think it's about them... Great to hear from you on your hillbilly, redneck and hick experiences even though you have much to tell... :)Ign Andy5 months ago Really funny hub,O Brother, Where Art Thou? is definitely my favorite so hilarious.

I been laughin'til the cows come home! I guess one of my favorite sayings is "Dear Gussie!" and "Shut the door, you ain't been raised in no barn!". Some sage advice I got was, " Don't cross your eyes, cause they likely to get stuck that way." and when I needed a good talkin' to or a whuppin',"Just wait til yo daddy gets home, he'll fix you good!"
