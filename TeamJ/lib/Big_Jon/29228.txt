We were drawn by the lures of a bigger place and a new neighborhood experience, and after about a year on the other side (of Interstate 5), North Park has won us over. Its central, its happening, and its got personality  so landlord willing, well be renewing our lease for another 12 months.Still, its hard to be away from The OB and to avoid comparing certain elements of life there with life in The NP. Heres an incomplete and unscientific review of some differences that have jumped out since we moved from Ocean Beach to North Park:Noise pollution: In OB, the number one source of nasty  noise has gotta be the airplanes, especially the bastard cargo plane  that flies out daily in the late afternoon or early evening. I once  heard that students who attend an elementary school in the flight path  and go on to Correia Jr High and then Point Loma High lose what adds up  to a full year of instruction because classes often pause to wait for  planes to pass overhead.North Park signNorth Park is plane-free but has its share of ear-shredding Harley-Davidsons and cars that rattle from cheaply amplified bass. The top noise controversy in the neighborhood right now seems to involve the potential extension of the operating hours of the Bluefoot Bar, which currently stays open until 2 a.m. only on the weekends. Ownership would like to add the weeknights, but some neighbors have protested actively.EDGE: NP because OB has those damn planesParking: One complaint from those North Park bar neighbors mentioned above is that late-night bar patrons tend to emit sounds similar to hyenas when they return to their cars, which  due to limited parking on streets that serve businesses  are often parked on residential blocks. At the same time, said patrons complain about having to do laps around several residential blocks to find their parking spots. One solution developed in recent years is the parking garage at 30th Street and North Park Way, which is an efficient parking solution as far as towering cement eyesores go.A sidewalk in Ocean BeachIn OB, parking is a bitch on Newport and at the beach lots on weekends and during other peak times, like the hour before sunset. On big holidays like the 4th of July, it might take you 20 minutes to walk from your car to the beach. Still, even on most crowded days, it rarely takes more than a few minutes to find a spot in OB  and the stroll to wherever youre going is likely to be pleasant, so its usually no big deal to park a few blocks away.EDGE: OB for less hassle and for freedom from ugly, hulking parking garageThe people-watching: 30th and University is an intersection of not just streets but cultures. At a given time, a Hispanic woman and an African-American high school student might share a crosswalk with a Korean senior citizen and a tattooed young white guy wearing a wife-beater and a pompadour. The most prevalent theme is hipster, with the  look on the street often including rockabilly tats on the forearms and  tight pants on the lower bodies, for ladies and gents alike.Over in OB  well, from May through October, the beach yields a steady stream of eye candy nearly every day. Like many beach towns, a year-round constant is people of all ages wearing wetsuits and carrying surfboards, many of which spend significantly more time under arms then under feet. Whereas in North Park, youll probably see someone cruise by on a motorized scooter, in OB the trendy transportation is more likely to be a raised pickup truck.EDGE: Shout to NP for the diversity, but OB wins with the beachNorth Park homesCocktails with attitude: PacShores on Newport Avenue is legendary for its wonderfully low-priced mixed drinks and its consistently unfriendly nighttime barkeeps, who could effortlessly ignore a firefighter if the bar was ablaze.Meanwhile, on a recent Sunday afternoon at Mosaic on 30th Street, more than one member of the staff voiced displeasure with a group of patrons who had the nerve to cheer occasionally at the Chargers game, which was playing on multiple large-screen TVs. Not sure if the hostility was a one-off, but it definitely was a turn-off.EDGE: OB because PacShores is so old, it has a right to be rudePolice helicopter intensity: When the 5-0 circle in helicopters over OBs skies, they dont tend to get on the microphone too often. But they do frequently pull that strange late-night maneuver where they hover in a given spot with their lights off, having fun with the night vision or something. That was always a wee bit creepy, to say the least.Over here in North Park, Ive heard at least two instances where the police were not just circling in a helicopter but were urgently using its loudspeaker. On one afternoon manhunt, the cops used the mic to repeatedly describe a person they were looking for. Another time, at about 2 a.m., the message was come out with your hands up!EDGE: NP for the added audio excitementDaytime moon over Brighton Street in OBArea bike rides: The bike ride from OB to La Jolla offers one of the worlds most glorious stretches of scenery, both natural and human. The bayside cruise is mellow and dotted with the smaller-scale vacation rentals, while the beach-side boardwalk offers not just ocean views and Brazil-cut bikinis but also a good chance of seeing that slow-motion RollerBlade guy.Still, the beach life just hasnt been the same since the party-pooper set banned drinking. At festivals in and around North Park, however, drinking still reigns supreme  and festivals with drinking seem to go on almost every other weekend. When it comes to exercise and nature and visuals and all that, North Parks biking options include Balboa Park, which is loaded with bike trails and touristy fun, just like the beach.EDGE: NP because of all the festivals you can ride home drunk fromUtah St. meets University Ave. in North ParkJack in the Box vibe: North Parks got a J-Box at the intersection of 30th and Upas, with a nighttime crew headed by a typically jovial Hispanic woman with cool tattoos who happily asks if you want whipped cream and a cherry on your chocolate shake. Customers are more unpredictable. Recently, when a woman waiting in the drive-thru lane two cars behind me thought I left too much space between my car and the one ahead of me, she rolled down her window and yelled, You are inconsiderate!Over in OB  at least up until about a year ago  a visit to the late-night drive-thru at Voltaire and Sunset Cliffs was all about the lady manager with an unusual haircut whose enthusiasm was palpable over the menu speaker and unforgettable in person. If you ever ordered from this woman, you know who she is, and you know you were smiling as you drove away with your two tacos for 99 cents.EDGE: OB for the customer service thats so good it feels awkwardDing! Ding! Thats the end of Round 1, with the score OB 4, NP 3. Well be back after these messagesShare|Did you find this article interesting?

Several things: great photos  but what did you do to the pic of the OB street and trees? Also, since when has North Park been called NP?  Plus, I heard over the years many audio announcements from the police helo in OB  the ones I loved to hate were like this: Black male suspect, white shirt, dark pants! And finally, what the f*ck are you doing still going to Barf in a box???Replydave riceDecember 15, 2010 at 10:06 amLove it!  And love both neighborhoods too, Ive got a few friends in North Park (never heard of NP myself), and would have no problem living there myselfsometimes the allure of a cheaper apartment calls out to me, but then I remember my tolerance quotient for hipsters and my general failure to see irony in observations like But its PBR!  Tall boy!  Dont you get it?  No.  And I dont want to yank my daughter out of school and move her across town  shes settled in good after 3 years in class herewell, 2.75 by your math given the airplane noise I suppose.Anyway, glad youre enjoying the rest of what San Diego has to offer and sharing it with uscan I assume theres a Round 2 coming?ReplyJonDecember 15, 2010 at 10:43 amGreat fun Shane!  Ive always felt a certain kinship between NP and OB.  Theyve got the neo-hipsters, weve got the neo-hippies, we both have great bars and nightlife, and everyone that lives in the surrounding suburban wastelands think that we are somehow dirty ghettos (because we enjoy diversity?).  One edge that I think NP currently has on us though is food.  The restaurants that have popped up around there in the past few years are amazing!  The Linkery, Urban Solace, El Take it Easy, etc While we have some fun options here, I just dont think we are quite up to par with NPs eateries yet.  Or perhaps Im just burnt out on our local fare?  Anyone is free to disagree with me.ReplyMarilyn SteberDecember 15, 2010 at 11:29 amWonderful article, Shane.  Ive sent it to a friend in Clairemont who has lived in both places and, incidently, works for JIB at corporate headquarters.  I cant wait until she reads your comparisons.ReplySethDecember 15, 2010 at 12:36 pmAlways a good read, Shane. I like North Park well enough, but as a fellow transplant, I just cant get past the idea of living away from the beach in Socal.ReplyShane FinneranDecember 15, 2010 at 2:19 pmThanks for comments, yall!Frank, regarding the initials, The OC begat The OB which happens to rhyme with The NP so there you have it. On that one OB photo, it looks weird because I added a Photoshop filter called Cut-out. As far as Jack In The Box, I dont do much fast food but I will always reserve a special place in my stomach for delicious sandwiches like the Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich (which interestingly is neither spicy nor crispy).Dave, I hope therell be a round two, whether from me or anyone else. Jon, there certainly are an array of amazing restaurants in North Park, at least thats what everyone tells me, as I lost my senses of taste and smell in a childhood bottle-rocket accident.Marilyn, you have a friend inside JIB corporate? That Jack seems like such a ham around the officeSeth, I hear you on the beach proximity. I wasnt sure if Id survive this past summer (my first away from OB in 10 yrs) but the effects of withdrawal were muted (or perhaps just postponed) by the unusual and relentless cold weather and water we had this year.ReplyFrank GormlieDecember 15, 2010 at 4:38 pmOkay, so does the cut-out filter make the image appear to be drawn/ painted?In general, your photos are awesome. Especially the one near the beach looking south.Oh, one other thing: OB was called OB waaaaaay before The OC or OC.ReplyShane FinneranDecember 15, 2010 at 4:47 pmThank you, Frank! Yes, the cut-out filter does just that. It has a few settings you can adjust to tinker with photos and is a lot of fun. (The computer program I use is actually Photoshop Elements, which is the consumer version of Photoshop and offers lots of useful features. Its sold with the also-awesome video-editing software Premiere Elements for less than $100.)ReplyShane FinneranDecember 15, 2010 at 5:26 pmbtw my taste and smell are intact  that was a second-rate Simpsons reference that was funny when I typed it, I swear!  Replydave riceDecember 15, 2010 at 7:36 pmIm now feeling inspired to try one on the backwater suburb where I grew upReplyPatty JonesDecember 15, 2010 at 9:18 pmI hear ya Dave. I toyed with the idea, for a few minutes.Replydave riceDecember 17, 2010 at 10:58 pmEh, what fun is it when theres no real contest?  I had a pool and a big yard at my old place andthat about concludes the good things Ive got to say.ReplyDallasDecember 15, 2010 at 2:39 pmGreat read, Shane! As an original OBceian in my teens to living in North Park as a young adult to now again living here in OB, I can say that both neighborhoods have a special energy about them. Maybe its the laid back history of both areas or maybe its that both neighborhoods attract a certain type of people. One thing is for certain, that while both areas are unique, they do have many similarities. North Park offers more living space. My apartment on 30th and Redwood cost me nearly half of what I pay for place of about the same size on Voltaire in OB. But with North Park, I didnt have the beach a block away. While OB tends to get its share or trendy types Yah, you know the types  in surfing culture theyre called Hodads (and where the restaurant got its name). In North Park, these scenester socialites can get away with it a bit easier. This is mainly because North Park is simply one urban area that is connected to other urban areas. One can get away with living in University Heights or Mission Hills (another once trendy neighborhood) but frequent North Park and pull off being a native. Ive seen people try to pull that off here in OB and they are quickly called out on it. Not that these people are not welcome, in most cases Ive seen them given an education (getting schooled) and after living a full season or so being fully accepted. But its just easier to spot a non-native in OB Hell, its easy to spot a Pointer from an OBecian in the element. But I digress. Both neighborhoods have much to offer. In fact, I have an OBecian friend who recently got married and theyre ready to have kids. Being in a small one-bedroom cottage here in OB is no longer feasible. And after talking to our landlord, the only place locally they can move to would cost them nearly $1000 more a month. I suggested to them that they move to North Park where they can find a nicer two-bedroom house built in the 40s for as much as they pay now here in OB. They dont want to leave the beach, but unless they decide that they will pay more to stay, its likely that theyll end up North Park.I love living in OB and while Ive considered moving back to North Park, every time I cant seem to leave this wonderful little place by the beach. I guess in the end, its like this: North Park has just about everything that OB can offer. Great places to eat, strong sense of community, places to party, and close enough to the every essential item of comfortable living. But OB has the beach and the small town attitude still exists here.ReplyOBTinyHouseDecember 15, 2010 at 4:18 pmI know exactly which Jack-in-the-box employee he is talking about! I lived NP adjacent and its nice because its not as effected by the marine layer but nothing beats being able to walk to the beach.ReplyOB MercyDecember 15, 2010 at 4:45 pmI paid my dues by growing up in the San Fernando Valley. Ugh. I lived in the same house for the last 25 yrs and hardly knew my neighbors. People just did not hang outside their houses and talk to each other. Just not done in LA. And its true, nobody walks in LA!  I spent so many visits in OB over the years with the goal always being to move here someday. When I finally moved down here just a year and a half ago, and until I could find work, I lived in La Mesaugh again. Felt just like the SFV, heat and all. It also seemed to be a cultural wasteland like the Valley. Then I moved to North Park. Besides thinking the area was pretty cool, good restaurants, and interesting peeps, I was only 8 miles from OB.I was getting closer!Then I finally found a good job (in this economy!), and moved to OB. My life feels SOOOO different now. I know most of my neighbors, we stand outside and talk to each other, we go to parties and events together, and each block in OB seems to be its own little community. I cant even begin to tell you how much I love it here. Living at the beach was always a life long dream, and it was not going to happen financially in Malibu or Venice. OB is one of the last affordable beach communities in So Cal. Im an old hippie, and have always been a bit eccentric, so I fit right in here. Every time I hear someone say theyre moving out of OB, they say they dont want to, but for some personal reason they must. I always think, how can they? But its only because Ive been trying to get here for 30 yrs!Its true, it seems to be very white here, and I miss the cultural diversity of LA, and I think generally speaking the restaurants are a bit better there, but things are changing here in SD too. And being an actor is much harder down here.I have an agent, but there is just hardly anything to audition for here. But I truly feel like Im living in  a different country here..I know that sounds weird, but thats how I feel. Hollyweird has its charm, but I got over it a long time ago!ReplyPatty JonesDecember 15, 2010 at 5:35 pmMercy! I had great fun watching you learn to wind surf!ReplyOB MercyDecember 15, 2010 at 9:33 pmThanks Patty!ReplyGoatskullDecember 15, 2010 at 7:50 pmNP is cool.  I live in Hillcrest these days and hang out a lot in NP.  My two favorite bars are Bar Pink (owned by John Reese of Rocket From The Crypt fame) and Toronado, a great hipster beer joint.  But the lesser know and in my opinion much cooler hang out is South Park.  Youll find me at the Whistle Stop and/or Hamiltons.  Still love and miss OB but not enough punk rock there.Replydave riceDecember 17, 2010 at 11:01 pmHamiltons is cool, and South Park is nice in that its like the North Park of the 90s that had just started gentrifying but still retained a healthy dose of grit.  Ive got friends in Golden Hill, which is another really cool neighborhood with a cool mix of characters of all sortReplyPatty JonesDecember 15, 2010 at 9:20 pmShane, this was a fun piece!
