A fifth-generation Texan who resides in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, he holds dual citizenship, being a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda and a United States citizen.In early 2009, Stanford became the subject of several fraud investigations, and on February 17, 2009, was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with fraud and multiple violations of U.S. securities laws for alleged "massive ongoing fraud" involving $8billion in certificates of deposits.[4][5] The FBI raided three of Stanford's offices in Houston, Memphis, and Tupelo, Mississippi.[6] On February 27, 2009, the SEC amended its complaint to describe the alleged fraud as a "massive Ponzi scheme".[7] He was arrested by the FBI on June 18, 2009.[8][9]Contents1 Early years2 Knighthood and revocation3 Family and personal life4 Career5 Legal troubles5.1 Fraud allegations5.2 Other business matters5.2.1 Tax liens5.2.2 Money laundering investigation5.2.3 Trademark infringement lawsuit6 Interests6.1 Cricket6.2 Media7 See also8 References9 External links[edit] Early yearsStanford grew up in Mexia, Texas. His father, James Stanford, is former mayor of Mexia and a member of the Board of Directors of Stanford Financial Group. His mother, Sammie, is a nurse. After his parents divorced in 1959, Stanford and his brother went to live with their mother. Both of his parents remarried.[10][11]James' father, Lodis Stanford, began as a barber and became an insurance salesman. In order to provide credibility to his company, Allen Stanford falsely stated that his grandfather started Stanford Financial Group in 1932.[12][13] Stanford Financials clients were affluent investors, institutions, and emerging growth companies throughout the world. Assets under management or advisement were in excess of US$8billion.[citation needed]Stanford graduated from Eastern Hills High School in Fort Worth, Texas.[11][13] In 1974, Stanford graduated from Baylor University in Waco, Texas, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in finance.[14][15][edit] Knighthood and revocationA February 2009 Houston Chronicle article described Stanford as "the leading benefactor, promoter, employer and public persona" of Antigua and Barbuda. Knighted by the country in 2006, Stanford used the title "Sir Allen." Antiguans also generally referred to Stanford using the title.[16] In October 2009 the National Honors Committee of Antigua and Barbuda voted unanimously to strip Stanford of his knighthood, and informed the prime minister of this decision on October 26. On November 2, 2009 the recommendation was forwarded to the Governor General. The order to revoke Stanford's knighthood and insignia was approved and was served upon Stanford in April 2010.[17]Stanford was the first American to be knighted by Antigua and Barbuda[18] and was presented with the honor by the then Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda, Sir James Carlisle which was later rescinded on April 1, 2010 after Governor-General Dame Louise Lake-Tack signed the order revoking his knighthood. In Antigua and Barbuda in October 2009, the National Honors Committee of Antigua and Barbuda voted unanimously to strip Stanford of his knighthood, and informed the prime minister of this decision on October 26. On November 2, 2009 the recommendation was forwarded to the Governor-General who then ratified it.[edit] Family and personal lifeThe headquarters of Stanford's company were in the Galleria Tower II in Uptown HoustonIn November 2008, Stanford denied rumors that he had fired his girlfriend, Andrea Stoelker, the president of Antigua's 2008 Stanford Super Series tournament board of directors, reportedly after she had a liaison with Chris Gayle, the captain of the Stanford Superstars: "These rumors are complete horse manure. We've been together seven years and we're happier than ever."[19] Stoelker had also been the manager of The Pavilion, a 5-star restaurant in Antigua owned by Stanford.[20]In April 2009, after an exclusive tour, Reuters reported that Stanford's office at the Houston headquarters of the Stanford Financial Group was adorned with a personal bathroom with a private exit, together with a sizeable bar in his massive office. Journalist Chris Baltimore summed it up as "a mass of marble and mahogany that once boasted a five-star dining room, movie theater, professional kitchen and wine bar. [...] Every part of the building is grandiose, which speaks to the larger-than-life image Stanford created as a jet-setting financier, sports promoter and philanthropist."[21]Looking around the office, Baltimore found it "easy to just gawk because of the grandeur of the place":Among several framed certificates hung on a wall is one with the gold seal of Antigua and Barbuda pronouncing Stanford Knight Commander, which allowed him to use the title Sir Allen Stanford, and a letter on White House stationery dated Jan.25,2006, signed by then-President George W. Bush.Then on to the bathroom -- a chamber of black granite and mahogany, with a gigantic mirror and granite countertop, flanked with shelves of fluffy white towels and toiletries, including a bottle of "Brilliant Brunette" shampoo.[22][edit] CareerStanford started in business in Waco, where he opened a bodybuilding gym, but it failed.[23] His first success in business was in Houston real estate from the Texas oil bubble burst in the early 1980s.[24] His partner in the real estate venture was his father James. In the 1980s, Stanford and his father made a fortune buying up depressed Houston real estate and selling it years later as the market recovered. When his father retired in 1993, Stanford took control of a company with 500 employees.[19]Stanford moved to the Caribbean in the 1980s, first to Montserrat and then to Antigua.[19] With the Stanford Finance, he started a bank on the island of Montserrat in 1985, Guardian International Bank, which he moved to Antigua during a British crackdown on Montserrat's offshore-banking industry in 1980s and renamed Stanford International Bank, an affiliate of Stanford Financial.[15]In early 2007, Stanford and Baldwin Spencer, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda and a former Stanford ally, began verbally feuding in public.[25]In 2009, Antigua's Financial Services Regulatory Commission has named a British firm, Vantis Business Recovery Services, as a receiver of Stanford International Bank and Stanford Trust Company, the Associated Press reported.[edit] Legal troubles[edit] Fraud allegationsMain article: Stanford Financial GroupReports surfaced in early February 2009 that the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a major U.S. private-sector oversight body, were investigating Stanford's company Stanford Financial Group,[26] questioning the means by which Stanford International Bank manages consistently to make higher-than-market returns to its depositors.[27] A former executive told SEC officials that Stanford presented hypothetical investment results as actual historical data in sales pitches to clients.[28] Stanford claimed his CDs were as safe as, or safer than, US government-insured accounts.[29]A leaked cable from the U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas reported as early as 2006 that companies under Stanford's control were "rumored to engage in bribery, money laundering, and political manipulation." The U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas at the time was reported to have "managed to stay out of any one-on-one photos with Stanford" during a charity breakfast event.[30]Federal agents raided the offices of Stanford Financial on February 17, 2009,[31] and treated it as "a kind of crime scenecautioning people not to leave fingerprints."[22]The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Allen Stanford with "massive ongoing fraud" centered on an eight-billion-dollar investment scheme.[4][32] Stanford's assets, along with those of his companies, were frozen and placed into receivership by a U.S. federal judge,[33] who also ordered Stanford to surrender his passport.[34]CNBC later reported that Stanford tried to flee the country on the same day as the raids on his headquarters: he contacted a private jet owner and attempted to pay for a flight to Antigua with a credit card, but was refused because the company would accept only a wire transfer.[35]FBI agents, acting at the request of the SEC, on February 19 located Stanford at his girlfriend's house near Fredericksburg, Virginia, and served him with civil legal papers filed by the SEC.[36] Stanford was not arrested until June 18, 2009.[37] Stanford has surrendered his passport to federal prosecutors, and he has hired the prominent criminal defence lawyer Brendan Sullivan, who represented Oliver North.[38] The SEC often files civil charges before criminal charges are filed.[39]Following the allegations, various governments have taken over Stanford's business operations. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) announced that it has taken over the local operations of the Bank of Antigua (BOA) which will be renamed the Eastern Caribbean Amalgamated Bank (ECAB).[40] The Venezuelan Government also took over the Stanford Bank Venezuela, the local branch of Stanford's bank in that nation.[41][42]On February 27, the SEC said that Stanford and his accomplices operated a "massive Ponzi scheme", misappropriated billions of investors' money and falsified the Stanford International Bank's records to hide their fraud. "Stanford International Bank's financial statements, including its investment income, are fictional," the SEC said.[7][43]In an interview on April 20 at the law offices of Houston criminal attorney Dick DeGuerin, however, Stanford denied any wrongdoing. His companies had been well-run, he claimed, until the SEC "disembowelled" them.[22]On June 18, 2009, Stanford was taken into custody by FBI agents.[44] According to DeGuerin:Federal agents in black SUVs surrounded his girlfriend's house this afternoon, and just sat there. I told him to walk out and introduce himself. So he did, and he asked them, 'If you've got a warrant, take me into custody. If you don't, I'm going to Houston.' And they did, so they arrested him.[8]On June 25, 2009, Stanford appeared in a Houston court and pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud, conspiracy and obstruction.[45] His lawyer claimed that he, Stanford, had resorted to liberal alcohol intake to grapple with the strain of the proceedings.On August 27, 2009, Stanford was admitted into the Conroe, Texas Regional Medical Center. He was being transported from the private prison in Huntsville, Texas to the Federal Courthouse in Houston to attend a hearing concerning his attorney, who has asked the court to be dismissed from Stanford's case. En route, Stanford complained of a racing heart.[46]On September 26, 2009 it was reported Stanford had been hospitalized due to injuries sustained in a fight with another inmate at the private Joe Corley Detention Facility. His injuries were described as non-life threatening.[47]On November 8, 2010, it was reported that Stanford had been hospitalized due to injuries sustained in a fight with other inmates at a private prison near Conroe Texas. Photographs show him with his neck in a brace, his eye half-shut, a bandage wrapped around his head, and shackled hand and foot.[48][49][50][51]A US judge has set a date of January 2011 for Stanford's fraud trial.[52] Stanford, Federal Bureau of Prisons #35017-183, is incarcerated at the Federal Detention Center, Houston.[53][edit] Other business matters[edit] Tax liensThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, affirming much of a United States Tax Courts ruling on a dispute emanating from Stanfords days of running the bank in Montserrat. In short, the court found that Stanford and his wife, Susan, under reported their 1990 federal taxes by $423,531.36.[54] Public records show Stanford owes hundreds of millions of dollars in federal taxes. There are four federal tax liens from 2007 and 2008 against Stanford totaling more than $212million.[55][edit] Money laundering investigationThe FBI and other agencies have been conducting an ongoing investigation of Stanford since 2008 for possible involvement in money laundering for Mexico's Gulf Cartel.[56][edit] Trademark infringement lawsuitIn 2001, Stanford said publicly that his great-great-great grandfather was a relative of Leland Stanford, the founder of Stanford University.[57] He funded the restoration of Leland Stanford's mansion in Sacramento, California in an effort "to help preserve an important piece of Stanford family history," and hired his own genealogists to prove he was a member of the Leland Stanford family.[24] ""We are not aware of any genealogical relationship between Allen Stanford and Leland Stanford," said a university spokesperson at the time,[24] and in 2008 filed a trademark infringement suit against Stanford claiming the schools name was being used in a way that creates public confusion and is injurious.[57][edit] Interests[edit] CricketStanford created and funded the Stanford 20/20 Cricket tournament in the West Indies, for which he built his own ground in Antigua. The first Stanford 20/20 Cricket Tournament was held in July and August 2006. The second tournament took place in January and February 2008 with a global television audience of 300million.[58] Trinidad and Tobago took first place in this tournament. This team also took home the US280k Super Series prize after defeating Middlesex on October 27, 2008.[59]In June 2008, Stanford and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) signed a deal for five Twenty20 internationals between England and a West Indies all-star XI with a total prize fund of 12.270m (US $20million) to be awarded to the team that wins the Championship. It was the largest prize ever offered to a team for a single tournament.[60] This was in jeopardy after a row with Digicel, the sponsors of the West Indies cricket team, who were unhappy about sponsorship of the event. Eventually, the dispute was sorted out and the first Championship was won by Stanford Superstars, who defeated the England team by 10 wickets, humiliating them in the Twenty 20 arena.[61]On February 17, 2009, when news of the fraud investigation became public, the ECB and WICB withdrew from talks with Stanford on sponsorship.[62][63] On February 20 the ECB announced it has severed its ties with Stanford and cancelled all contracts with him.[64][edit] MediaStanford owned two newspaper businesses in both Antigua and Barbuda[65] and Saint Kitts and Nevis,[66] which both went by the name of The Sun. Following the scandal, both newspapers have put workers on notice that their full operations would cease in April 2010.[67][edit] See alsoHouston portalBiography portalCaribbean Star AirlinesCaribbean Sun AirlinesFBIStanford 20/20Stanford Cricket Ground, Coolidge, AntiguaLaura Pendergest-HoltPonzi schemeStanford Financial Group[edit] References^ "The World's Billionaires: #205 R Allen Stanford".
