"Decisions piling up, going in circles" deemed mentally competent by N.P.D. investigator Ronald Appel to sell her home. Olga Bass deemed mentally competent by police and her attorney to sell her home of 25 years.  All the proceeds from the sale went right into her attorney's business associate's stock brokerage!!!!!!Several days before signing away her home. Kaiser Permanente diagnosed "Nonfocal,Paranoia with Auditory Hallucinations"  The real estate broker stated in the police report my mother was, "SHARP AS A TACK."Physicians diagnosis: Olga Bass, "Non-Focal, Paranoia with Auditory Hallucinations. Now with songs playing in her head for almost a week." Kaiser Permanente MedIn Section 35 of the police report, Mary Hamler stated the following to Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel, "Ms. Hamler said that Olga Bass was mentally capable of making decisions including the decision to sell her residence."In Section 6 of the police report, Attorney Scott Henry Carter, Mary Hamler's Probate Attorney stated, "Olga Bass was fully aware of finances and had handled her assets with no interference or assistance by him."Elder Abuse - Real Estate Fraud - Financial FraudUpdated November 2010. This happened to me and my mother, Olga Bass, now deceased.Elder Abuse: If you do not speak your voice will not be heard, if you do not write your message will not be seen. The information that I provide will hopefully help others to avoid the difficulties that I have encountered. And, perhaps help stop crimes in progress.After reading my email, Attorney Steven Peck wrote, "Unfortunately, this may be a very typical scenario as it regards what is transpiring to our elders in society today, including the promising of particular results, praying on their instincts to trust the "trusted" individuals, and the costs to the elder to recover their trusted funds." Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel who investigated my complaint saw no evidence of Attorney Steven Peck's observations what so ever.It could be human nature to say that such a thing could never happen to some one in my family. Why, I thought I had done my research effectively; hired an attorney (Scott Henry Carter) that specialized in Elder Law and protecting the elderly, moreover, I had asked the attorney for a referral of a home health aide to monitor my mother in the nursing home to shield her from and report any abuse. Attorney Scott H. Carter referred Mary Hamler to me.Even more, I hired a financial adviser, Mark Deemer of Prudential Wachovia Securities, to monitor my mother's investments and pay bills when necessary. Mark Deemer also referred Mary Hamler as a Home Health Aid. Additionally, I employed a property management company, Pro Properties Only, to manage, lease, maintain, collect the rents from my mother's home and deposit the proceeds into her account. So how was it possible that this support system collapsed, completely?In short, my mother's home of 25 years was sold, Attorney Carter opened a new account to deposit all the proceeds from the sale of the home at his business associate's firm, Northwestern Mutual, Mary Hamler, unlicensed to make medical decisions had been making my mother's medical decisions including the administration of psychotropic drugs instead of Kaiser Permanent physicians and psychiatrists, Mary Hamler opened a joint bank account my mother as a partner in the account, and Mary Hamler assumed my Power of Attorney involving my mother's estate. All the above, including the real estate broker selected by Attorney Carter, agreed my mother was mentally competent to make the decision to sell her home. The official Kaiser Permanente medical and psychiatric documents on this page clearly indicate my mother, according to law, was legally mentally incompetent according to The Due Process in Competency Determinations Act (DPCDA) Sections 810-814. This law was ignored by Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel during his investigation and never mentioned in the police report involving my complaint submited to him. Why?My Mother was legally mentally incompetent when she made major changes to her estate.Olga Bass, Legal Mental Capacity and Elder Abuse, Part 2 of 4The Due Process in Competency Determinations Act (DPCDA),which is embodied in sections 810-814 of the Probate Code, requires that a determination of lack of mental capacity be supported by evidence of a deficit in at least 1 specific mental functionThis document was carefully worded, no mention of mental incompetency or DPCDA Sec. 810-814. My mother's 4 physicians+psychiatrists weren't interviewed by Appel Find the guilty innocent by means of Selective Interview methods.  Do not ask questions of the witnesses that may incriminate them! A horific process of Don't Ask-Don't Tell.I had obtained Power of Attorney with Full Authority from the Napa Superior Court and I was representing myself as my own attorney.  When my mother's Kaiser Permanente physicians and psychiatrists refused to discuss my mother's diagnosis and mental competence with me I sought out an expert independent opinion from Dr. Janet Cain of Napa, California.I submitted my mother's medical and psychiatric files to Dr. Cain for review and opinion.  Although there were numerous diagnosis of Dementia, Auditory and Visual Hallucinations, refusing to take her meds, hiding her meds under her pillow in the nursing home and suicidal ideation Dr. Cain stated to Officer Ronald Appel in Section 40 of the police report, "Dr. Cain said that she could not form an opinion based upon the records Steven Bass had provided her with.  Dr. Cain said that doing a post mortem evaluation without speaking and evaluating Olga Bass would be impossible."This is important for adult children of elderly parents to know.  Doctors' and psychiatrists' officially written reports and diagnosis of Dementia, auditory and visual hallucinations are valueless when used at a future time to determine the mental state of a victim in the past.  Incredible!  Notice by Napa Superior Court Order Subpeona to appear rejected...With our apologies, Mr. Bass, we won't be attending to your court order by subpoena for questioning. Subpoenas are worthless. My mother's Kaiser Permanente Primary Physician Dr. Lippman. Refusal to appear in court by subpoena.Appel's refusal to attend trial by subpoena for questioning.  Note written by Napa Police Department Records Supervisor Imelda Preciado.My primary physician's refusal to attend trial by subpoena. I was spent and at the edge of death.  The refusal of the above persons to attend trial caused me grievous disappointment in the United States legal system.  Elder Abuse marches on.The disappointment above was only exacerbated by the three attorneys that had originally agreed to represent me and then either failed to do nothing or filed a complaint then withdrew counsel.  The first attorney, Duncan Footman Esquire, agreed to represent me but never filed a complaint with the court after five months after having agreed to represent me.  Statutes of limitations would be expiring and I was going out of my mind, waiting, waiting.  Emails from Footman: Next week, next Wednesday.  Next week and next Wednesday week after week never came.The second attorney was Michael Stewart Esquire.  After looking at the evidence I had collected, Stewart said he would take my case, represent me.  He said, "To get a fair trial your trial will have to be moved to another city outside of Napa."  He copied my files, some 1,000 pages of evidence I had collected.  Thirty days later I received a kind letter in the mail stating he was no longer going to represent me.  Another horrific shock.  I asked for my evidence files he had copied.  He refused, stating, "They are mine, I paid Office Depo for the copying charge! Those belong to me!"The third attorney, Gary Cloutier Esquire, whose legal staff reviewed my complaint and supporting documents, who agreed to help me actually filed a lawsuit against Mary Hamler in the Napa Superior Court.  Weeks passed.  Twelve hours before the first case management meeting in Court I received an email from him that he was withdrawing legal counsel.  I went into emotional shock and appeared in court without legal counsel.It is shocking that three key witnesses refused to appear in Court.  It is equally disturbing that three attorneys abandoned representation.  I feel there was a lot of back door talk and am highly suspicious that these people were offered compensation to take the actions they did.  Elder Abuse-  you will find very, very little support involving your claims and accusations.I am not unfamiliar with government corruption. The Northern Sierra Summer Home Association, Sacramento, California, was formed as a response to excessive Special Use Permit fees levied on cabin owners on United States Forest Service lands.

Red flags went up. Perhaps unknown to the home health aid I had enrolled my mother in a Kaiser Permanente medical insurance program and had taken out long term care insurance as well.My suspicions that the home health aid was lying about the cause of the sale of the home were confirmed with the appearance of the tax statement. Only two thousand dollars in medical expenses. During the police interview, the home health aid stated that she "misspoke" and stated instead that the home was sold because of the expense of cost for repairs. The witness to that statement, a manager at a local public storage, apparently could not be induced to deny having heard the home health aid make her statement. The manager was out of the loop.The cost of the repairs to my mother's home was $10,000. As shown in the real estate sales contract, my mother reduced the sales price of her home to the buyer by $10,000 to make the stated repairs. This evidence was submitted to the police investigator.The home had been generating $10,000 a year in rental income for my mother. She had owned the home for twenty-five years and it was insured against damage and fire.My mother's attorney, in an email to me, stated that "no rights whatsoever" were given to the home health aid. A false representation, according to court documents the home health aid had acquired financial Power of Attorney. I discovered the transfer of my Power of Attorney to the home health aid after my mother's death. While I started asking questions of others about the sale- the financial adviser, the real estate broker, the property manager, and the financial advisers, my mother's former home was put on the market and sold for a profit of US$300,000. An attorney informed me that the home was probably sold so that the sale of the home could not be rescinded. The sale of a home under emotional duress and a sale based on fraudulent foundation could have been rescinded.Kaiser Permanente physician Barbara Paul, M.D. recorded in the Patient Progress Report six days before mother, age 87, signed the contract to sell her home that "Since Thursday a lot of probs piling up/decisions going in circles/trouble deciding what to do. Now w/songs playing over and over in her head for almost a week. A/P Paranoia w/auditory hallucinations". For the past weeks the home health aid had been taking my mother to meetings with the attorney, financial adviser and real estate broker about selling her home. All eventually benefited by the commissions and fees earned directly from the sale of the home.Shortly after my mother signed the contract to sell her home, she was admitted to Kaiser Permanente Emergency Room with the presenting complaint, "I had to give up my home." According to the Kaiser Permanente medical report, three days later my mother was diagnosed with Dementia.After the home health aid began taking my mother from her nursing residence to her home the followed symptoms were recorded by Kaiser Permanente leading up to the sale of her home:Home health aid, look over Olga's home (from HHA's invoice)another entry, Home health aid, look over Olga's home (from HHA's invoice)Vertigo, Dizziness, Weakness, FatigueHypertensionCough, Weakness, FatigueOlga said, "She was going to die, was not going to eat or take any more medication".

After commissions and credit to the new owner ($10,000for repairs to her former home) an amount just over $100,000 remain.Attorney Scott Henry Carter stated during the police investigation that my mother was mentally competent to make the decision to sell her home.On March 11 the home health aid, Mary Hamler, and Napa, CA. attorney Scott Henry Carter, are present when my mother opens a new account with "acceptable risk" at Northwestern Mutual to deposit all proceeds from the sale of her home. The account was opened at Scott H. Carter's business associate's company, Northwestern Mutual. There was no need to open a second account. My mother had an existing account at Prudential Securities. Warren Nelson of Northwestern Mutual benefited directly via commissions earned as a result of the opening of the account.The law enforcement investigator, Ronald Appel, according to the police report, who was assigned to investigate my complaint did not interview the physicians or psychiatrists who had provided treatment for my mother. He could have interviewed them about my mother's state of mind before, during, and after she signed the contract, but no interview took place... even after my complaint was published as front page news in the local newspaper, the Napa Sentinel. My mother's attorney stated to the law enforcement investigator my mother was "mentally competent" to make the decision to sell her home, as well as manage her financial affairs. According to the police report, the police investigator diminished the seriousness of my mother's mental state. I gave the police investigator copies of all of the above medical records.The police investigator could have interviewed the property manager that was managing the rental of my mother's home to confirm if my mother's attorney was telling the truth. The attorney stated that my mother decided to sell her home and then moved into the nursing home. NO. She had been living in the nursing home for over a year before the home sold. Had the police investigator questioned the property manager, the property manager would have said, oh no, Olga moved into the nursing home over a year ago. Her home has been rented to a tenant and her daughter for over a year. The attorney selected the real estate broker that sold the home. The real estate broker who listed and sold the home reported to the police investigator that my mother, mentally, was "sharp as a tack".All proceeds from the sale of the home were used to open a new account at a stock investment company managed by a business associate of the attorney, Northwestern Mutual. The attorney, Scott Henry Carter,stated that the account was shut down after the collapse of the stock market.The attorney stated that the remaining funds were transferred to my mother's original account at Prudential Securities. That does not make sense to me. The police report does not mention what the opening balance was at Northwestern nor the closing balance. The new Northwestern financial adviser was never interviewed during the police investigation. The closing balance equaled the opened balance. Does that constitute the failure of the account? The police investigator could have asked these questions. Is the transfer of the funds from Northwestern to Prudential a statement of Northwestern's incompetence, or were the funds transferred for a different reason? When I asked questions to my mother's Prudential Securities financial adviser Mark Deemer, about her account, the financial adviser stated,"You are getting my hackles up!!!"I filed a complaint against Mark Deemer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Their email response to my complaint was this, "Hire an attorney. It is your word against theirs." and that was the last I heard from them until I filed another complaint. SEC referred me to the financial adviser's complaint (legal) department. The complaint department has not contacted me regarding any action taken. As far as SEC's recommendation to hire legal counsel, I do not have $75,000 to hire an attorney. That is the starting cost to hire an attorney to begin legal proceedings against the accused. Elder abuse and fraud persist for these very reasons.Complaints filed with regulatory agencies are but voices in the wind. Legislation passed to fight against elder abuse is worthless when regulatory agencies do not respond and follow through with filings by complainants. The result of these types of responses has a horrifying and stun to silence effect on the complainants and the victims. The home health aid, MaryHamler,wrote a note to Kaiser Permanente instructing them to contact her and not me regarding any issues involving my mother. This information, written on a small yellow sticky note, was recovered when I obtained my mother's medical files from Kaiser Permanente after her death. Kaiser Permanente was taking instructions from Mary Hamler, a women who I later discovered had no legal authority to give Kaiser Permanente instructions of any type, yet she, Mary Hamler, without medical certification, had, according to written documentation provided to me by Kaiser Permanente, had been "making my mother's medical decisions for years". I just went into shock.The home health aids invoices, both from Mary Hamler and Denelle King, recovered after my mothers death showed billings for up to $60.00 a day at $20.00 per hour for cleaning her room at the nursing home. Room cleaning and maintenance had been included in the services provided by the nursing home and those services were billed for in the monthly nursing home fees. I reported my complaint to the State of California Governor's Office emergency response unit for elder abuse. Agent Araceli Flores was assigned to my complaint. Agent Flores met with me several days later. Then she spoke to the police investigator assigned to investigate my complaint. I waited a month for a response from Agent Flores. Nothing.Then I called her at her Sacramento office asking her what had happened, why had I not heard from her. No one answered the phone. I left a telephone message with her answering service, cries and pleading to her for her to continue her investigation and please contact me. Agent Flores never responded. I then called her supervisor leaving a message for help. Again, no response.Two months later, I received a banker's box from the State of California elder abuse investigating unit containing the files I had given to Agent Flores for review. There was no cover letter in the box, only my research and findings involving my complaint.After reading the police report involving my complaint I learned that Agent Flores was convinced by the police investigator to drop my complaint.... everything would be taken care of on a local level. No need for an independent investigation by State of California officials. The police investigator provided information about the investigation, and, "Ms. Flores seemed satisfied that an active investigation was being conducted." Ref.: Sec. 27. Ms. Flores said the City of Napa had jurisdiction over this ongoing investigation and that her involvement in the matter would end." Neither Flores or Appel informed me of this. I did not learn about until I obtained the police report later.The police investigator could have allowed Agent Flores to continue her investigation. What would have been the harm? Allowing the State of California to conduct its own independent investigation would have not cost the local police department any cost in labor hours or any other of its resources. It was about that time that I stopped contacting other state and federal agencies about my complaint. Crushed and demoralized, I thought any other independent investigation would be shut down by the local police department.At the time of my interview with the police investigator, he informed me that the home health aid still had some of my mother's funds in her Prudential Securities account. A year and a half had passed since my mother's death. I asked the police investigator why my mother's attorney, financial adviser, or the home health aid had not informed me of the existence of these funds? The police investigator responded, "The money is probably being used to pay bills." A year and a half after my mother's death? What bills? No accounting was provided showing what bills remained unpaid. During the entire course of my independent investigation, the home health aid refused for over one year to respond to my telephone calls, emails, and USPS certified mail I had sent to her. She cancelled her email account. What was my mother's money doing in the home health aid's account? And, an account with Prudential Securities! Approximately two weeks after the police investigator informed me of the existence of the funds I received a check from Prudential Securities for $6,300.00. There was no letter providing an explanation for the check. The check did not list the home health aid's name. The name of a subsidiary branch of Prudential was named as payee. My mothers elder law attorney is still in business today. The real estate broker and the financial adviser, both working for international corporations, remain in business. The financial adviser at Northwestern Mutual, has retired, I was told. The home health aid, according to her attorneys court testimony "lost her business" of $60,000 a year. No demand for retraction of information I provided on the three front page newspaper reports about those people was made. No counter lawsuit for defamation or libel was filed.I was in a state of emotional and physical collapse under the multiple pressures of the shocks of discovery, trial preparation, subpoena preparation, key witnesses repeated refusals to accept subpoenas, the police investigator and primary physician asking me to change the date of the trial, my uncertainty if I had answered demurs correctly, strict protocols for court document preparation, court deadlines, trial management meetings, settlement conference preparation, preparation for examination and cross-examination questions of the defendant and the witnesses and was unable to take my legal proceedings further. An attorney I had just met whom I asked advice how to prepare for the trial management meeting saw the deteriorated emotional and physical condition I was in and suggested I drop legal proceedings. I agreed. Immediately she called the defendant's attorney and said, "We have a settlement!"My God, I had made a mistake. "We"?Three hours later I was in court dismissing the lawsuit.About the Author... Stephen is available as an Elder Abuse Prevention keynote speaker for your event or seminar.

Those documents verify the shortage of $40,000 Prudential Wachovia Securities financial adviser Mark Deemer opened my inheritance account with. Tax documents from the IRS show the account was opened with $40,000 less than what Mark Deemer opened the account with. Deemer has refused to respond to all email enquiries I have sent to him regarding that shortage.Several months ago Michael Derkacz, property manager at Concordia Manor nursing home, sent me an email indicating that my mother had moved into the nursing home over a year earlier than claimed by my mother's attorney, Scott Henry Carter (see email below).  Why would Scott H. Carter lie about the date she moved into the nursing home?  Why did not police investigator Ronald Appel ask attorney Scott Henry Carter to show documents to confirm his claim?  Officer Appel stated in the police report that he interviewed attorney Carter in his office.  My mother's legal file undoubtedly was in the same office.If you are an attorney who would take my complaint under consideration please contact me. I did not before have first hand information to contradict the attorney's statement made to police. Evidence I provided to the police investigator; income statements from the rental of her home and billings to my mother by the home health aid showing my mother's address at the nursing home while the home was being rented were apparently deemed inadmissible. The email I refer to above is accompanied by a scan of my mother's "MOVE-IN" contract indicating the date she became a resident at the nursing home.A Woodland, California attorney, Michael Stewart, who reviewed my research and was unable to take my case because he did not have sufficient staff said I had cause for the following legal actions:real estate fraud financial fraud undue influence negligence breach of contract unfair business practice legal malpractice fraud constructive fraud churning breach of fiduciary duty collusion conspiracyThe attorney also said that I would not get a fair trial in Napa. The trial would have to be moved to another city."...there is nothing substantive in Mr. Bass's charges."Police Officer Ronald Appel: "The attempt to have a judicial review of Mr. Bass's allegations and support documents in obtaining search warrants lend support that there is nothing substantive in Mr. Bass's charges."Sample #1 of Rejection Letters from State and Federal Agencies.Dear Mr. Bass,We have received your web complaint as shown below.

A handbook on how to identify and report potential elder abuse and elder financial abuse is available at the Lake County District Attorney's Office.Advocating Elder Law ReformI am an advocate of elder law reform.I believe the following legislation should be passed. The immediate family must be contacted, the testing of mental competency, a determination if the cause of major estate changes are justified, in addition to a review of medical and financial records should be made:before elderly parents revoke Parent to Child Gift Deeds involving the sale of their homes or other real estate. One of the persons interviewed by police said my mother sold her home because she did not like the property manager. The question must be asked, does the reason for the sale of the home justify the sale?,before elderly parents revoke Powers of Attorney for finances transferring the power to a home health aid or other day worker,before medical providers, such as Kaiser Permanente, accept written communication from a home health aid to cease all communications with family members,before home health aids are allowed to make medical and psychiatric decisions for elder patients without proper medical licensing and permission of family members (in my mother's situation and without my knowledge or consent, Kaiser recorded that the home health aid had been making my mother's medical-medication decisions "for years"),before aging parents open new stock and securities accounts family members be notified and a mental competency examination be conducted by licensed professionals. The key question must be asked, why is the new account being opened when there is an existing account at another securities company? In my mother's case a new and second account had been opened at a competing stock brokerage after my mother had been diagnosed with Dementia.and in conclusion, that State and Federal agencies be allowed to conduct independent investigations of elder abuse complaints without influence or interference from local police departments. Legislation should be passed barring local police departments from any interference involving State and Federal investigations of elder abuse until State and Federal investigations are complete.Elder Abuse: If you do not speak your voice will not be heard, if you do not write your message will not be seen.

Both the financial adviser and the Securities and Exchange Commission have failed to respond. The most recent concern I wrote to the SEC about was a US$40,000 discrepancy regarding the amount due me by Prudential Wachovia. SEC ignored by request for intervention. Instead, SEC forwarded my concern to the Prudential Wachovia legal department as did the financial adviser. It is possible that as long as the theft and loss to the consumer or the beneficiary is $40,000 or less, such complaints do not meet the litmus test for the standard required for attention and complaints simply fall on deaf ears. I am very, very disappointed and gravely saddened. Meanwhile the statute of limitations for legal actions tick away one day at a time.

She moved into Concordia Manor , apt. c-211.  As I have stated before, we do not have a scanner. I can fax this to you or mail it. Your choice.Michael D.The receipt below, written in Mary Hamler, clearly indicates Attorney Carter lied to Officer Appel.This evidence, the receipt below, in addition to many others given to Appel, bearing my mother's residence address at Concordia Manor, was suppressed by Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel. No where in the police report are the receipts commented on. To do so would have invalidated Attorney Scott Henry Carter's police statement that my mother moved into Concordia in 1998 after her home sold. Attorney Scott Henry Carter's police statement, Section 8 of the police report, "The sale of the house went through in March 1998 and Olga Bass moved to Concordia and later to Napa Nursing Center." Horrific lies, horrific suppression of evidence, horrific lack of vetting the statements made.The evidence I provided to the Napa Police Department investigator Ronald Appel was simply ignored.  This invoice clearly demonstrates that Mary Hamler and Denelle King were aware my mother was living at Concordia.  This and many other invoices having my mother's Concordia Manor address, predating the sale of her home, were given to  Officer Ron AppMary Hamler, Olga's home was sold because she did not like the property management company.From Mary Hamler's police testimony, "Ms. Hamler said that Olga Bass had told her that she had wanted to sell the house because she did not like the property rental company handling the house.  Olga Bass had decided to sell the house because of the costs to make certain repairs to the house.  Ms. Hamler said that Olga Bass was mentally capable of making decisions including the decision to sell her residence."I was never informed of any problems involving the property management company.  Regarding the costs for the repairs, my mother paid for all of the repairs and the home was still sold.  Irene Winnie, Social Worker, Concordia Manor: "The decision to sell the house was that of Olga Bass and that she was in complete control of her mental facultiesOfficial Police Report testimony given to Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel by Concordia Manor Social Worker Irene Winnie.Mary Hamler police testimony, "Olga Bass was mentally capable of living on her own".

Mary Hamler stated on Page 8, Section 35, of the police report-interview that "Olga Bass was mentally capable of living on her own". An outrageous lie that every nursing home administrator, every home health aid agency, every government agency whose responsibility it should be to safeguard seniors, all, should be climbing the walls at such an unfair, unjustified statement. Why, Mary Hamler, if my mother was capable of living on her own, did you make medical decisions involving the administration of the psychotropic drugs that were administered to my mother!The sale of my mother's home occured over 1 1/2 years after my mother moved into Concordia Manor.  Additional evidence against attorney Carter. Olga Bass's home was leased to Jennifer Colombo while Olga was in Concordia Manor nursing home. This is contrary to attorney Scott H. Carter's police statementIn Section 8 of the police report, Attorney Scott Henry Carter stated to Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel, "It was clear to him (Carter) that Olga Bass was cognitive of what she was doing and what she wanted. The sale of the house went through in March 1998 and Olga Bass moved to Concordia and later to Napa Nursing Center."Attorney Carter lied again to Officer Appel when he stated that my mother moved from Concordia to the Napa Nursing Center. Attorney Carter omitted that my mother was moved from Concordia to the Christian Retirement Residence prior to being admitted to the Napa Nursing Center. Officer Appel did not interview the owner - manager of the Christian Retirement Home.The physician's record does not concur with Attorney Carter's evaluation. Moreover, Attorney Scott Henry Carter lied to Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel when he stated my mother moved into Concordia when her home sold. As the rental receipt below clearly shows, my mother's home was leased to Jennifer Colombo as early as January 1, 1997. The Move-In contract farther down this page clearly indicates my mother moved into Concordia Manor before her home was leased by the landlord, Pro Properties Only, to Jennifer Colombo.It is notable and horrifying as well that Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel elected to suppress this evidence. It is equally horrifying that Officer Appel elected not to interview Jennifer Colombo to determine whether or not Attorney Scott Carter had told him the truth or lied. In fact, Jennifer Colombo's name appears no where in the police report. Don't ask, don't tell.It is also notable that Officer Ronald Appel did not interview the two psychiatrists or the two primary Kaiser Permanente physicians who had been treating my mother.  Their names as well appear no where in the police report. Olga Bass's home was leased to Jennifer Colombo while Olga was in Concordia Manor nursing home.  This is contrary to attorney Scott H. Carter's police statement Conclusive evidence below that my mother's attorney, Scott Henry Carter, had knowledge of the rental of my mother's home.  The words below, "..your attorney.." Within 6 days, my mother went from paranoia to "sharp as a tack".Within six days, my mother went from diagnosed as "Non-focal", having auditory hallucinations- hearing voices and songs in her head, and being extremely paranoid to "sharp as a tack".  This is difficult to believe.Attorney Scott H. Carter selected Catherine Fetzer of Coldwell Banker, Napa, California to sell my mothers home.  Ms. Fetzer agreed completely with attorney Carter that my mother was mentally competent.  In fact, in the police report, Ms. Fetzer stated that she had met several times with Mrs. Bass and said that her mental faculities were "SHARP AS A TACK".Eviction notice for Jennifer Columbo to give up her lease at my mothers home, 2560 Hawthorne Court, Napa, CA.  Why did attorney Scott H. Carter lie to police? Attorney Scott Henry Carter wrote the eviction letter evicting Jennifer Colombo from my mother's home.The real estate sales contract signed by my mother on  October 29, 1997 over a year after she had been living in Concordia Manor nursing home. Olga Bass: "very psychotic behavior, extremely paranoid, is hearing voices, songs" on Oct. 22, 1997, seven days before she signed the home sales contract . From day to day the pattern of disturbance is evident.  My mother was diagnosed with Dementia later. Attorney Carter stated my mother was competent to sell her home.Irene Winnie, Social Worker, Concordia Manor: "The decision to sell the house was that of Olga Bass and that she was in complete control of her mental facultiesOfficial Police Report testimony given to Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel by Concordia Manor Social Worker Irene Winnie.Diagnosis: STILL Paranoia, Tangential Speech, Auditory Hallucinations, Refer to Psyc. for Evaluation.  Irene Winnie-  "Olga Bass was in complete control of her  Evidence ignored, suppressed, diminished in value and severity or deemed inadmissable by investigating Officer Ronald Appel. The embezzeled funds (the check below).The embezzled funds. Officer Appel informed during his interview of me of the existence of approximately $6,000 in Mary Hamler's account. I asked why I had not been informed of the existence of those funds before now, approximately a year and a half after my mother's death. Officer Appel replied, "The money is probably being used to pay bills." A year and a half after my mother's death? Why hadn't Scott Carter, Mary Hamler, or Mark Deemer informed me of the existence of those funds? No response.Mary Hamler, Mark Deemer, and Scott Carter do not encourage communication. Without receipts for expenditures, I will have to pay the full amount of tax on that money as earned income.Mr. Mark Deemer, Mary Hamler, and Scott Henry Carter, would you please send me a list of the bills that were paid to close out the account regarding the $6,3000 check below.One reason this money was not revealed to me by Deemer, Carter, or Hamler could have been they did not want me to ask the question why had not that money been included in the amount of inheritance money used to open my account.  Then they would have had to reveal that the funds were in Hamler's account.  That would have led me to ask how the funds got into Hamler's account.  Then it would have had to been revealed that financial power of attorney had been terminated and put into Mary Hamler's name.  I did not discover that my power of attorney had been terminated until after my mother's death.The cause for the delay of notification, testimony given to Police Officer Ronald Appel: "Mary Hamler said she had overseen a small portion of Olga Bass's assets.  She had paid Olga Bass's bills through the account the two had set up.  Mary Hamler was eager to finish out the account but was advised by Scott Carter the attorney for Olga Bass to wait until all the bills had been paid.  Mary Hamler said that the account currently held about $6,000.  I suggested that she contact Scott Carter about closing out the account and forwarding the remaining funds to Stephen Bass."The police report does not state that Appel asked Hamler, Deemer, or Carter for an accounting to determine what, if any bills, needed to be paid or that were paid. I need those receipts!!!I had repeated communications with both Carter and Deemer during the year and a half before.  Neither men informed me of those funds or that my power of attorney had been terminated and put into Mary Hamler's name.  Mary Hamler rejected all certified mail I sent to her in my efforts to get questions answered.This check does not bare Mary Hamler's name or her business name, Marelle Services.These are the funds kept in Hamlers account 1 1/2 years after Olga's death. If not listing Mary Hamler's name on this check, could this be considered collusion and conspiracy between Deemer, Carter, and Hamler?  Why would the check not have Mary Hamler listed as the payee?  Scott Henry Carter billing of $1,922.80 for legal services for 2560 Hawthorne Ct., showing he had knowledge of the sale. According to real estate agent Fetzer,  Prudential Wachovia Financial Adviser Mark Deemer (Napa, Calif.) violated Prudential Securities corporate law in talking to my mother about the sale of her home "Prudential or Wachovia Securities is not involved in any way in the sale or rental of real property."Mary Hamler- sit in on meeting about selling Olga's home with Mark Deemer. See receipt above: 9:20 to 12: 05, nearly three hours to clean and straighten my mother's room, C-111 at Concordia Manor. Fee? $55.00.Both Hamler and King billed my mother on a regular basis for cleaning, dusting, vacuuming and straightening her room at Concordia Manor. Room maintenance had been included in my mother's contract with Concordia.The question remains, how many of the other 35 elderly persons billed by Hamler and Kingpaid them unnecessarily for services that were included in their nursing home contracts?The selling of my mother's home for $135,000.00 because of repairs and their cost. Ref. above: Sec. 53 of the police report: Police Officer Ronald Appel spoke to Mary Hamler about the sale of Olga Bass's home: "I spoke to Mary Hamler about the statement that she is to have made to Stephen Bass regarding the need to sell the house to pay medical bills. Ms. Hamler said she had made the statement but that she had misspoke. She meant to convey that the house had been sold because of the repairs and that this is what Olga Bass had wanted." If the justification for the sale of the home had been the repairs, and their cost, as real estate broker Katherine Fetzer stated below, the logic that my mother sold her home because of the repairs and their cost then paying for the repairs is illogical. The cost of the repairs:1. Comfort Zone Sheetmetal for Gutter $600.1. Performance Garage Door for repairs $1,922.002. Bill Howell Roofing for Repairs $3,250.003. Termite work to: Silverado Termite $5,360.00This and all other documents on this page were made available to Napa Police Officer Ronald Appel. The quality of this evidence was either diminished in value, deemed unacceptable, intentionally avoided, or ignored.The real estate contract stated that the home was to be sold "AS IS". After the sales contract was signed by my mother, she made out a check to Glen Nunley for $10,000 for additional repairs. The check was made out by my mother after she had been diagnosed with Dementia. I was not notified of the diagnosis, nor was I informed of the $10,000 given to Nunley. The real estate contract was violated. I only learned of the of the medical diagnosis after my mother's death when I obtained my mother's medical records from Kaiser Permanente. I learned of the $10,000 in funds given to Nunley long after I obtained documents after my mother's death- long after the sale had been completed. Evil, vile, ruthless people.Below Fetzer wrote my mother spoke of me often, wanting to see me. Conversely, many of the people interviewed by Ronald Apell stated we were distant.  Fetzer changed her statement during police interview, "Fetzer said Mrs. Bass was angry at her son." and that "She had been contracted to sell the residence at the request of Olga Bass".Sec. 7, Police Report, Att. Scott H. Carter: "Olga Bass was fully aware of finances and had handled her assets with no interference or assistance from him."Below, Olga is diagnosed with Dementia Feb. 2, 1998.  Below, Olga is diagnosed with Dementia Feb. 2, 1998. Revocation of Gift Deed signed 24 Feb 98."The purpose of his work(Carter)was to establish a trust to protect her estate from taxes and to limit probate costs" Carter lied. My mother and I met with Carter for the main purpose for passing title of her home to me after she passed away.Attorney Carter signs and notarizes Olga's Revocable Gift Deed on February 24, 1998. After diagnosis of Dementia, Carter opened a new account to deposit the proceeds from my mother's home. No need. Mother had existing acct. with Prudential. Warren Nelson was a business associate of Scott Henry Carter.  According to the police report, the account turned bad because of the stock market.  The remaining money was transfered over to Prudential."...there is nothing substantive in Mr. Bass's charges."Police Officer Ronald Appel: "The attempt to have a judicial review of Mr. Bass's allegations and support documents in obtaining search warrants lend support that there is nothing substantive in Mr. Bass's charges."Another lie by Attorney Scott Henry Carter: ..."no rights whatsoever were signed over to Mary Hamler."

Another lie by attorney Scott Carter's recommendation the best way to transfer title after death was a revocable living trust. I thought both my mother and I were clients of Scott Henry Carter.  No.  Carter was careful in all his billings to my mother that contacts with me were noted NC As a result, I was never a client, therefore I could take no legal action against him.Mary Hamler gave police testimony that "Olga Bass was mentally capable of living on her own."  Below, Kaiser Permanente diagnosed my mother as a "danger to self Information omitted from the police report...Reference above: "Dr. Lippman made it clear that however, that the pt. (Olga Bass) apparently made at least two suicidal notes/gestures."May 13, 2002, POA form signed by my mother, Olga, and given to Mark Deemer, Prudential Securities. City of Napa Business License Department: No business license issued to Mary Hamler, Denelle King.  No history for Marelle Services.  No taxes paid. The business license clerk suggested I walk across the hall to see if there was tax paid on Hamler's and King's income.  The tax collector said no and that "These people are completely off the radar!"Hamler and King operated Marelle Services from approx. 1996 to 2004 when Hamler's attorney said she lost the business because of my publications in the Napa SenThe tax clerk for the City of Napa told me that there had been no history of any business income tax paid by Marelle Services.  According to www.manta.com, Marelle Services generated an income of $60,000.00 per year.  The tax clerk told me, "These people are completely off the radar".  This evidence was submitted to Officer Ronald Appel and omitted from his police report.Denelle King failure to respond. Typical responses from Mary Hamler and Denelle King when I was making enquires regarding my mother's estate. Hamler gave testimony she was out of the state, did These types of responses from Mary Hamler and Denelle King only hightened my suspicions of wrong doing.  Hamler also blocked her email address rejecting my enquires.Letter rejected from Mary Hamler Hamler told Appel she did not get any of my letters because she was out of the state of California.  How was she aware I sent her letters if she was out of the state?Letter rejected by my mother's attorney Scott Henry Carter.  Was he out of the state of California as well? Question to Mark Deemer: "Do you know who authorized the forwarding of my monthly Prudential statements to (Mary Hamler) P.O. Box 2309? Wachovia Prudential Securities Financial Adviser Mark Deemer, "No I don't know the answer to that question."Mark Deemer and Mark Deemer alone had computer access to change the mailing address on my monthly statements.To this day, March 23, 2010, Mary Hamler retains months of my Prudential financial statements. She has not returned those statements to me. She refuses to accept the many letters I have sent to her. She cancelled her email account preventing me from making enquiries by email. Repeated telephone calls were not returned. Those documents noted that the account was Transfer on Death (TOD). Mark Deemer terminated that account and opened a new account classified as a retirement account. I still do not know where or how much money was in the original account. This type of pain goes on year after year after year after year, the pain of no response, no explanation, nothing. Although Deemer and Hamler have my contact information, neither of them have made any effort to return my monthly Prudential Securities statements. Below: Kaiser Pharmacist Yolanda True reviewed the meds my mother had been taking. Yolanda said my mother had been poly-drugged.  According to a Kaiser Permanente physician's memo, Mary Hamler had made my mother's medical decisions for years.Sec. 7, Police Report, Att. Scott H.

Carter: "It was clear to him that Olga Bass was cognitive of what she was doing and what she wanted." Carter giving testimony to Officer Appel regarding the sale of Olga's home.diag2 Problems involving the Police ReportThere was no mention of the evidence I provided regarding the following:1. Neither Mary Hamler nor Denelle King had a City of Napa Business license to operate their home health aide business in the City of Napa. The City Clerk told me there was no business license on file for either Hamler or King. The clerk suggested that I walk across the hall and ask the business tax clerk if the tax collector had any information on Hamler or King. The clerk keyed into her computer the names Mary Hamler, Denelle King, and Marelle Services. Hamler and King had been in business for six years according to invoices. The business tax clerk stated no history, these people are completely off the radar. According to Manta.com Hamler had an annual income of $60,000 per year. Police Officer Ronald Appel omitted that information from his police report.2. Kaiser Permanente secretaries in Napa were a great assistance. It was the secretaries who suggested I check with the City of Napa business licensing department to determine if either Hamler or King possessed a business license. After I reported back to them that they did not, one of the secretaries suggested that I contact the State of California licensing department for home health aides to determine if either Hamler or King possessed the necessary credentials and licensing certification to conduct business as a home health aide in California. The HHA licensing and certification department stated they had no record of either Hamler or King having any certification or license. I asked Attorney Scott Henry Carter specifically for a home health aide. Carter recommended Mary Hamler. That neither Hamler or King had State of California Home Health Aide licensing or certification was omitted from Officer Ronald Appel's police report.3. Although, as per Kaiser Permanente record, Mary Hamler had made my mother's "medical decisions for years" she was unable to have my mother assigned to hospice. My mother's attorney, Scott Henry Carter, was also unable to authorize my mother for hospice care. Why? He was her attorney. 4. The police report noted that Mary Hamler had said "she meant to convey the house had been sold because of the repairs and that is what Olga Bass wanted." Then, the police report noted that Glenn Nunley, the buyer of the home received a credit of $10,000.00 for repairs which was paid out of the escrow account at the time of the sale of the residence. The sale of the home to Nunley had been listed "as is". The true sales price was not $135,000. The actual price, after the $10,000 credit, was $125,000. I was never alerted to this arrangement and only discovered it months later after my mother's death.5. Neither of my mother's psychiatrists nor her primary physician or staff nurses were interviewed by Officer Ronald Appel. Why?6. There was no mention in the police report about Jennifer Colombo, the woman who had been leasing my mother's home while my mother was a resident at Concordia Manor.7.The police report omitted that my mother's home had been earning $10,000 per year in rental income for her while she had been a resident at Concordia Manor.There are other problems to be noted as I am able.

Its me, Gramie3, from the emails. I am so glad to see you have uploaded this all on here. We are still at a standstill in our situation with Mr. Scott H. Carter. He is a crook and I hope you can do something about this!World-Traveler9 months ago Hello Grdngmom3Thank you for contacting me again. It is horrifying to hear that the problem involving Attorney Scott Henry Carter has still not been resolved and now it has been over a year. Silence, rejection, delay and denial: A strategy resulting in depression, frustration, dismay, and disappointment.I was worried about you. I had not heard from you in quite some time. The activities of Attorney Scott Henry Carter involving my family's estate brought me very, very close to the edge of death.Discovery after discovery of fraud and deception were having a severe compounding effect on me. As attorney Michael Stewart said, there was evidence of the following:1. real estate fraud2. financial fraud3. undue influence4. negligence5. breach of contract6. unfair business practice7. legal malpractice8. fraud9. constructive fraud10. churning11. breach of fiduciary duty12. collusion13. conspiracyCarter is indeed a "wizard" as his email namesake demonstrates. A wizard at deception. I do hope other people of Napa, (Napa, California) other clients of Scott H. Carter, will come forward and voice their complaints about this unethical and ruthless attorney. He has caused both my late mother and I unbearable torment, excruciating pain, unnecessary financial loss.Grdngmom, I am pleased you decided in joining me to come forward and make your complaint against Attorney Scott Henry Carter public. Now others may do so as well. If they do not write their message will not be seen. If they do not speak they will not be heard.It took me two years of research into my mother's estate to uncover the discoveries that I made. It was not easy, not at all. I do encourage other clients of Scott H. Carter, former as well as current clients, to look over carefully all aspects of legal affairs involving their relationship with Carter as well as individuals or companies that have been involved with their estates, indirectly or directly through Carter or any of his associates.Ask Carter for the complete legal file that he has on you yourself, a family member, or relative. Is there any sign of delay or resistance? If so, there could be a problem, and even after obtaining the legal file, the problem itself may be burried under events and situations that may be unknown to you.Do not delay. If an executor to the estate is assigned, as almost happened to me, you could be barred by law in obtaining any information about the estate in question.Any prospective change in the family estate involving Scott H. Carter or his associates (stock brokers, home health aides, real estate brokers) should be scrutinized very closely before any paperwork is signed. Be aware that my Power of Attorney was terminated without my knowledge, only discovered years after the change was made, given to Mary Hamler, the home health aide Carter referred to me to monitor my mother for nursing home abuse.It is of vital importance that a mental capacity examination be given by a licensed geriatric psychiatrist, not referred by Scott H. Carter, to any elder parent or relative before any new bank or securities account is opened, any transfer of funds be made, any changes in medical power of a attorney or financial power of attorney be made. Medical and psychiatric records and history should be reviewed. Is the intent to make legal changes consistent with the previous desires and wishes of the elder parent or relative, or is the legal change asked for sudden and inconsistent with previous intent? And, that the following questions be asked of the elder parent or relative:1. Why do you want to make this change?2. Who has talked to you about making this change?3.

I understand how you have been feeling based on your emails to me. Please keep writing.Sincerely,Stephen BassGramie38 months ago Hi Stephen!Have you gotten any help with your case yet? I wrote a big long comment a couple of weeks ago and for some reason it didnt post, so I will just summarize:Saw many similarities from your story including the use of Fetzer and Wachovia in our case. Our estate is STILL not settled. Why? Because we are STILL waiting on Scott Carter to finish the paperwork. Its been nearly 15 months now.Take Care, I keep checking in here to see if you have nay updates...World-Traveler8 months ago Hello Gramie3Thank you for your email.  No, I have not found an attorney to help.  My statute of limitations is running out.  It appears there is no attorney willing to go up against Scott Carter.  He has somehow managed to completely insulate himself from approach.  Statutes of limitations have run out on your case if the statute is one year.I did not get your previous post.  I do not know why.World-Traveler8 months ago Clear flag Attorney Monday, April 19, 2010 11:18 AM From: "Ed Doonan (via HubPages)" Add sender to Contacts To: s_bass2001@yahoo.comEd Doonan (eddoonan@webpayee.com) has sent you this message.(email address not verified)Good morning, I am investigating a possible complaint against atorney Scott Carter. an you please contact me (916)718-5603 directEd Doonan (eddoonan@webpayee.com)(email address not verified)Dear Mr. Doonan,Thank you for your message Mr. Doonan. Can you tell me the nature of your possible complaint against attorney Scott H. Carter? Are you an attorney, law enforcement (active or retired), or private security consultant?Thank you.Stephen BassGrdngmom35 months ago Stephen,Did you ever speak with the guy who was investigating a complaint against Scott Carter? I wonder what happened with that? Supposedly our estate is wrapping up this week, after 18 months and a total of 50,000 in lost rent and attorney fees, thanks to Mr. Carters total mismanagement in handling the trust, mainly his inability to complete things in a timely manner. Will be filing complaint with the state as soon as it settles! Hope you are well!World-Traveler5 months ago You can Google Doonan's name and telephone number.  He is working for either Apell or Carter or both.  When I started asking him questions all I got was silence.Carter buries legal issues two, three and four levels deep.  Carter lied when he wrote to me by email that he had a confidentiality agreement with my mother and as such he could not release any information about anything involving her, yet there was no mention of any confidentiality agreement when he was interviewed by the police department.  Carter has the elderly signing away their estates when they have been pumped with enough pharmaceuticals, in my mother's case, by the woman Carter recommended, Mrs. Mary Hamler.These people have caused my mother and I unbearable grief, torment, and financial loss.Consider yourself lucky that you only lost $50,000.  My loss is well over $500,000.00 and growing each day.  Family home gone, equity gone, rental income gone.  GONE, GONE, Gone...  Thank you Attorney Scott Henry Carter!!!dallas934443 months ago Wow!  Will come back and read again....World-Traveler3 months ago dallas93444Thank you.Mtnsong2 months ago OMG!  Sending this to others in Napa!  This is my mother's attorney! BAttling elder abuse is hard.  I know, I have been caught in the same battle against my brother.  Mother was his income and leaching off of her for years!  Attorneys should protect the elderly not exploit them!  My mother just passed away.  I will definitely get another attorney!World-Traveler2 months ago If you are referring to Scott Henry Carter as your mother's attorney, YES, definitely get a new attorney!!!You need to obtain your mother's legal file from attorney Carter to see what changes in your family's estate were made without your knowledge.  To do this you will need to obtain Letters of Administration with Full Authority from the Napa Superior Court.  Then, send a copy to Carter by USPS Registered Mail Reciept Requested.  Good luck.Also be aware that a retired attorney in Napa, a retired attorney who had nothing to lose, told me that the Napa District Attorney, the "Voice for Victims", does not often take elder abuse cases where the losses are less than $500,000.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sitesThe Vallejo, Calif. attorney who reviewed my case wrote, "Bass- said he spoke w/Hulbert who denies signing this doc b/c it's illegal for nurses to sign wills... Kathy Hulbert was Gladys Bruno's nurse at Piner's Nursing Home, Napa, California.The Ramos family was large but only Mary Hamler was selected as the Executor of the estate.There had been a "falling out". Mary Hamler was paid for caregiver services by both my mother Olga Bass and Gladys Bruno. Hamler got control of both of their estates. When I met with the Rios family and mentioned Mary Hamler's name, the adult son threw up his arms and said, "I don't want any part of it!" and walked out of the room.  The nurse said the family had a falling out.  Hamler took control of the estate.Source: http://Divide and conquer.Legal actions taken by Mary Hamler were illegal. She was operating a business without a City of Napa business license and under the pretense of being a HHA. The State of California had no Home Health Aid training certification or license on file for Mary Hamler.  Scott Carter and Mark Deemer misrepresented Hamler's qualifications. My mother's home was listed for sale "AS IS".  Then purchaser Glenn Nunley received a $10,000 credit from the sale to make the repairs. Glenn Nunley's statement to Napa Police Department Investigator Ronald Appel...My mother's home was listed for sale  "AS IS"."Mr. Nunley said that he had received a credit of $10,000 for repairs which was paid out of the (Olga Bass's) escrow account at the time of the sale of the residence."  Mary Hamler, the women I hired to check on my mother for elder abuse, stated to police investigator Appel, "Olga Bass had decided to sell the house because of the costs to make certain repairs to the house."My mother, then age 88 years, was deceived.  My mother believed she had sold the house to avoid the cost of repairs to her home only to end up paying for the repairs at the close of escrow.  Hamler sat in on the meeting with my mother's Prudential Wachovia Financial Advisor Mark Deemer when discussing selling her home.My mother, Olga Bass, had owned her home for 25 years, paid in full without liens or encumbrances. It had been leased for over a year bringing in a steady income for my mother.Elder Abuse of Olga BassOlga Bass- http://hubpages.com/hub/Please-Support-My-Petition-involving-Elder-AbuseOlga Bass- Part 4 of 4.
