   ThinkProgress           David Frum On Tucson Tragedy: Lets Blame Pot Rather Than Easy Access To Guns    ThinkProgressWonk RoomYglesiasProgress ReportThink ProgressDavid Frum On Tucson Tragedy: Lets Blame Pot Rather Than Easy Access To Guns            By Zaid Jilani  on Jan 10th, 2011 at 1:11 pm          David Frum On Tucson Tragedy: Lets Blame Pot Rather Than Easy Access To Guns Following Saturdays tragic shooting of several people, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), by 22-year old assassin Jared Loughner, many have asked how someone who displayed so many obvious characteristics of mental instability was able to easily obtain access to a semi-automatic firearm. As Time Magazines Nathan Thornburgh points out, Arizona has particularly weak detection and reporting of mental health. (It is technically illegal to sell firearms to the mentally ill.) In a post on FrumForum, conservative pundit David Frum dismisses renewed calls for gun control and instead says that the incident should remind us why we regulate marijuana, noting that Loughner is suspected of being a marijuana user. He writes that there may be renewed pressure to control the weapons that committed the crime, but instead chooses to place blame on the trend these days toward a more casual attitude and easier access todrugs:After horrific shootings, we hear calls for stricter regulation of guns. The Tucson shooting should remind us why we regulate marijuana.Jared Lee Loughner, the man held as the Tucson shooter, has been described by those who know as a pot smoking loner. [...]After the Tucson shooting, there may be renewed pressure to control the weapons that committed the crime. But what about the drugs that may have aggravated the killers mental disease? The trend these days seems toward a more casual attitude and easier access to those drugs. Among the things we should be discussing in the aftermath of this horror is the accumulating evidence of those drugs potential contribution to making some dangerous people even more dangerous than they might otherwise have been.It should be noted that, of course, marijuana is illegal. However, the extended magazine that Loughner used in the shooting  which allowed him to get off as many shots as he did before he was subdued  was illegal until the assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Additionally, in an interview Mothers Jones conducted with Bryce Tierney, a friend of Loughner, Tierney claims that the alleged shooter quit drinking and doing drugs in 2009  years before the shooting took place.Update The Atlantic's Andrew Sullivan notes that the Drudge Report is now exclaiming that Loughner is a "left-wing pothead."TweetPrintFeatured Comment: Max_1 asks, "Can Frum please point out the other pot related shootings?"AnonymousDont shoot me, Im just the dealerI wonder what David Frum has been smoking.

This Frum guy seems a bit confused about cause and effect, doesnt he?http://www.youtube.com/BizarrobrainBizarrobrainIll say it till Im blue in the face, correlation does not equal causation. Schizophrenics have a greater instance of substance abuse, but also have a greater instance of stress inducers such as poverty, exposure to violence, broken homes, abuse, and so on. It doesnt take a genius to see how, in general, people who come from a more troubled background are going to be more likely to abuse substances.Of course, the cons have latched onto the cannabis aspect, and this stupid unfounded assertion wont die. Never mind that cannabis use has increased over the last 30 years, while the rates of schizophrenia occurrence have remained stable. Never mind that close to 90% of schizophrenics smoke cigarettes. But weed? Well that shit will give you the reefer madness. This is a pathetic attempt to draw fire away from the media, Frum.I know I shouldnt expect anything else from an ex-Bush speech writer (hes one of the main people responsible for pushing the idea that Iraq attacked us on 9/11). No wonder you left Canadaonly the conservatives here in the US are gullible enough to believe your bullshit.Anonymous.Gun-friendly laws made Arizona shootings possible, Brady Center president tells Rawhttp://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/01/gun-friendly-laws-arizona-shooting-brady-president/The president of the Brady Center To Prevent Gun Violence told Raw Story that excessively permissive gun laws are a culprit in the tragic shootings of 20 people in Tucson, Ariz. Saturday.Among those shot by 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner were federal judge John Roll, who was killed, and Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), who was critically wounded. The gun Loughner used was lawfully purchased, The Associated Press reported.Apparently everyone who knew him lately describes him as very disturbed  the military rejected him, the school he was at asked him to leave, Paul Helmke said in an interview. But those are not disqualifying factors in this country from getting a gun.The Washington, D.C.-based Brady Center, a leading group in the cause of gun control, was named after President Reagans press secretary Jim Brady, who was shot and permanently disabled during an assassination attempt on the president.We need to face up to the fact that there is a problem with gun violence in this country, Helmke said, advocating primarily for background checks on anyone seeking to purchase a weapon. We now allow people to get guns that can shoot a lot of bullets quickly and kill a lot of people, and thats what we saw yesterday.(continued).mhandrhYeah, sure, thats the ticket!

Ive represented hundreds of potheads in my day, and if theres one thing clear its that its hard to get the dedicated pot smoker interested in doing anything  let alone shoot a lot of people.  The biggest problem with my pothead clients is getting them to make it court or other appointments on time or to come out of their self-induced fog long enough to do what theyve been ordered to do.  Its too bad Loughner wasnt smoking pot on Saturday.  If hed had a couple of bowls he might have decided just to relax in front of the TV with a bag of Doritos instead of going on a killing spree.http://www.youtube.com/BizarrobrainBizarrobrainYeah the only thing Ive ever seen a stoner kill is a two liter of Mountain Dew and a big bag of chips.AnonymousI dont use drugs and I dont even advocate the legalization of weed.

Pot makes people relaxed to the point of inertia.Someone high on pot doesnt go on  a shooting rampage.Someone high on alcohol can and will do anything.So, I say, legalize pot for individual usage, tax it and use the money to go after real drug criminals.BTW,  anyone know anything about his parents??AnonymousIs Frum channeling the completely bogus, anti- marijuana propaganda film Reefer Madness?AnonymousPoint of fact: lots and lots and lots of right wingers smoke pot.  They often (but not always) therefore refer to themselves as libertarians.  I wouldnt be surprised if the number of pot smokers in the U.S. is fairly evenly divided between the political left and right at this point.AnonymousA Glock is a great gun.The first Glock pistol was introduced in 1980.  The original Glock 17, was chambered in 9mm parabellum, with a capacity of 17 rounds.  The Glock soon gained the reputation for never jamming, which caused the Austrian Army to be very impressed with the pistol.  The army soon selected the Glock 17 to be their official side-arm.  This remains true to this day.As recently as 2006, data shows that the .40 caliber Glock 22 was the most preferred choice of police departments in the United States.The reputation of Glock pistols is legendary. The reliability of the feeding mechanism, firing pin, slide and extractor approaches the reliability of a revolver. Glock pistols are famous for their functionality. Glock pistols have been put through torture tests that will boggle the mind.  If you could watch a torture test youd see guys bury the Glock pistol in mud, they pack the Glock pistol with sand, they let it soak in salty water for a week, and freeze it in ice. Theyd shoot the Glock slide with a .22 caliber bullet, drop the Glock pistol from an airplane and dig it back out of the ground that it sunk into. Then, amazingly, theyll pick it up, shake it off, load it, and it will fire. It is one of the most reliably operational guns on planet Earth, bar none.http://pulse.yahoo.com/_OPYWPOJE7P364MYUADOYFJW6UIAny MouseI blame the Daily Kos, the Huffington Post and ThinkProgress for their hate filled rhetoric.AnonymousAccording to a law enforcement memo based on information provided by DHS and obtained by Fox News, Jared Loughner, the alleged shooter of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, may have been influenced by a pro-white racist organization that publishes an anti-immigration newsletter.http://mediamatters.org/research/201101100007Ah, strange how that doesnt mention that sneaky lil lady Mary Jane.AnonymousProgressivism kills people.http://pulse.yahoo.com/_OPYWPOJE7P364MYUADOYFJW6UIAny MouseI blame Keith Olbermann, undoubtedly the worst person in the world.AnonymousPOT, Maybe I missed something.

Some tokers may experience psychological distress following marijuana ingestion, which may include feelings of panic, anxiety, and paranoia but the effects are temporary. With very large doses, marijuana can cause temporary toxic psychosis (defined as any major mental disorder of organic or emotional origin marked by derangement of personality and loss of contact with reality, with delusions and hallucinations and often with incoherent speech, disorganized and agitated behavior, or illusions). This occurs rarely, and almost always when marijuana is eaten rather than smoked. Beyond that there is no convincing scientific evidence that pot causes psychological damage or mental illness or just raging insanity in either teenagers or adults.http://www.youtube.com/BizarrobrainBizarrobrainOh shitmind blown.AnonymousIf hes a progressive like hes been described as being, he likely doesnt have a father at home.AnonymousYeah , how desperate do you have to be to trot our Reefer Madness imagery in an effort to deflect from the actual issue.

If you teach your children to hate, with words, deeds and actions, what type of people are you creating?By the same token, dont the words that the talking heads on the right use matter as well? They may not move a rational person to act violently, but there are always people on the fringes that can be moved to act in irrational ways.

Trolls think that everybody who commits a crime is a liberal.Tom DeLay just got sentenced to three years in prison.  Im just counting the minutes before a troll claims hes a liberal, too.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PZPpWTRTUBamboo_HarvesterThank You ~ My mistake.Anonymoushey Elbruce,glad to see youre back.you:One quote does not create a political climatereality: ** Obama: They Bring a KnifeWe Bring a Gun** Obama to His Followers: Get in Their Faces!** Obama on ACORN Mobs: I dont want to quell anger. I think people are right to be angry! Im angry!** Obama to His Mercenary Army: Hit Back Twice As Hard** Obama on the private sector: We talk to these folks so I know whose ass to kick.** Obama to voters: Republican victory would mean hand to hand combat** Obama to lib supporters: Its time to Fight for it.** Obama to Latino supporters: Punish your enemies.** Obama to democrats: Im itching for a fight.I posted this yesterday..you must have missed it.BTW-that was just Obama..care to see some other less than pleasant rhetoric coming from other Dems/pundits?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PZPpWTRTUBamboo_HarvesterLOL (:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PZPpWTRTUBamboo_HarvesterI posted on the wrong thread  Thx.EugenDebsYou are a LIAR you are a dick and you are a diseaseEugenDebsGOD but you are stupid and pathetic. NONE of those are a call for violence and unless you are too STUPID to breathe you know that so that makes you a LIAR tooEugenDebsWell I did my own, admittedly limited study on the long term effects of smoking pot. About 25 years worth and I never remember wanting to shoot anyone EVERAnonymousWHAT THE FUCK?!http://pennsylvaniaforchange.wordpress.comCats r FlyfishnReally?  You fell for the lies.  Im sure that scam artists love you because you fall for all their lies.http://pennsylvaniaforchange.wordpress.comCats r FlyfishnOf course he would say that.  Hes probably making money off of the illegal gun trade.  Yes, its guns for pot while innocent Mexicans are killed by smuggled guns.  If marijuana was legal in this country, the Mexicans wouldnt need more guns, you fool.AnonymousLOL! And your post would be referred to as idiot. Period.AnonymousMr. Frum is naive he confuses Weeds, Cheech and Chong etc. with reality. Most pot heads I know are right to hard right. Big Gov, gun control, the man, and gays. They hateem all! Just like their bros and sis in  Republicanland.AnonymousThe only thing Ive wanted to kill while stoned is a can of Pringles.Leftside_AnnieIts me, its me, Dave! I got the shit!Leftside_AnnieAdd Doritos to that, and you have Nirvana.Leftside_AnnieWhy dont you shoot yourself then? Youre a tiresome bore.http://profiles.yahoo.com/u/BVCIOPPYBYZ2UKU4FUMRYE4XGUJeffrey KYes, pot is an equal opportunity employer across all kinds of social and cultural lines, hippies and rednecks, judges and ditch diggers all seem to like it about the same.  The only real dividing line Ive noticed is that (with some notable exceptions) a much bigger percentage of guys than women enjoy it.Leftside_AnnieSane conservative?OMG, youve actually MET one?!?Leftside_AnnieThank you for your CONCERN.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PZPpWTRTUBamboo_Harvesterdavid frum (Canadian Jew, speech writer for g bush jr)Obviously you learned nothing from the naziswhatta worthless piece of shit you are  should you ever decidehang yourself with your phylacteries I will applaud you hardily.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PZPpWTRTUBamboo_Harvesterdavid frum, you are a poor poor excuse for a human beingyour mamma must be proud of you ..but, you will never clean your hands of the blood from aiding the bush regimehttp://tpzoo.wordpress.comJaneElizabethTheresaSechnyForgive me if Im repeating anyone elses comment, butThis is the same David Frum who said:Frum: Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us and now were discovering we work for Fox.

Its not the reefer smokers who have the blood of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis on their hands.  We dont need any lectures from the likes of you.  If people had listened to us hippies about George Bush, Iraq, and tax cuts, wed be several trillion dollars less in the hole right now and somewhere between 200,000-1,000,000 people who died violent deaths in Iraq would still be alive.So STFU, you moronic war criminal.AnonymousReefer Madness!Pot doesnt MAKE you do anything but to the extent it has an influence, it will make you LESS likely to shoot someone.All we are saying, is STFU, Frum.

Its when he makes sh!t up that he comes up with stupid remarks.Remember that the GOP/AEI kicked him out as a heretic because he dared to tell them the truth (a year or two too late).AnonymousGiven that IPs suggestion has zero chance of being enacted (unless our legislators are dumber than previously thought), I think he was being sarcastic, not serious.But if you were railing against petes suggestion of a national standard for firearm licensing, youre more paranoid than you think.AnonymousRWAs will only back laws that will bring uncomfortable change to groups of people who are not them.Thats why SB1070 passed Im not Latino, so I dont care if the cops get a papers please law in their favor. and its why gun regulations were dismantled in AZ I dont want cops telling me what to do with MY gun.AnonymousI bet he ate bread too. 99% of all the people in prison were former bread users.http://www.google.com/profiles/thechefhatesyouthe orjYou have to look at the effects of the various drugs. Pot has a tendency to make people lethargic and hungry and thats about it. To my knowledge theres no peer reviewed, respected scientific evidence that suggests that pot makes people violent.http://pulse.yahoo.com/_RT7QVB4M24IUIV5MCB3DUUXIVEDietPepsiPleaseIt was probably the pot smoking that kept him sane.  It is quite common for those suffering mental illness to self-medicate with alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs (and I am not saying that all pot smokers have mental illnesses, so lets stop that before we get started).  If it is true that he stopped smoking pot and drinking alcohol in 2009, that is probably why he continued to have mental problems through 2010 and up to this event.  But it is easy to blame the pot smokers or blame Loughner himself.  Because that way we dont have to face our abhorrent treatment of the mentally ill in this country, the lack of identification and treatment, or our free-for-all gun laws (or non-laws) that allow virtually anyone access to whatever type of firearm they want, or our nasty, hateful, and inciteful political rhetoric.  Loughner is to blame, now lets go out and not do anything about it.  Yippee!http://www.facebook.com/people/Thomas-Douglas/756770456Thomas DouglasOnly potsmoking gay Muslims that have had abortionswhich seems like a total contradiction, though Im sure more of them exist than the conservatives favorite walking contradiction: Atheist Islamist Marxist Socialist Fascist. The strategy is in the insanity of it all.http://www.yuregininsesi.comyuregininsesiIf the shooter had access to cheap, legal marijuana, he would not have killed anyone. If he is a schizophrenic, he may have found the effects of the marijuana medicinal in nature. He probably stopped smoking pot and returned to a less-sane state.blog comments powered by DisqusJump to TopAbout Think Progress | Contact Us | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy (off-site) | RSS | Donate 2005-2011 Center for American Progress Action FundRSSView Most PopularMost TweetedMost EmailedMost CommentedLast 24 HoursThis WeekThis MonthVIDEO: House Republicans Explain Why They Wont Give Up Their Own Government-Sponsored Health CareChamber President Tells Congress To Starve To Death Financially New Consumer Protection BureauRep.
