 ARIZONA OUTRAGE: Rep. Giffords Shot in Tucson; U.S. Judge Killed; Gunman Identified as Jared Loughner, 22 : The Other McCainHomeAbout Robert Stacy McCainAbout Smitty The Other McCain"One should either write ruthlessly what one believes to be the truth, or else shut up."  Arthur KoestlerARIZONA OUTRAGE: Rep. Giffords Shot in Tucson; U.S. Judge Killed; Gunman Identified as Jared Loughner, 22Posted on | January 8, 2011 | View CommentsUPDATE 5:05 p.m. ET: According to CBS News, Jared Loughner, 22, reportedly used a semi-automatic pistol with an extra-large ammo clip in the attack that critically wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), killed at least five others  including a 9-year-old girl, a federal judge and one of Giffords aides  and wounded several more people.Information about Loughner is sketchy. It appears he has had at least one previous run-in with law enforcement. What appear to be messages Loughner left online suggest he was suffering from mental illness. Da Tech Guy has scheduled an extra hour of his radio show tonight to discuss this bloody tragedy.UPDATE 5:25 p.m. ET: It has been confirmed that U.S. Judge John Roll was killed at the scene.UPDATE 8:35 p.m.: Arizona Shooter Seems to Be Someone Desperately Needing Mental Health Care. According to various reports, Loughner had a criminal history and had attempted to enlist in the Army but was rejected.Ill be on Da Tech Guys radio show tonight to talk about this sad incident. You can listen liveat the WCRN Web site.Please note that the updatesbelow are not allin chronological sequence. Im trying to post new information in order of importance.UPDATE 6:05 p.m. ET: Warner Todd Huston has transcribed the demented gibberish in the online videos posted by Jared Lee Loughner.Beyond the general incoherence, the evidence of mental illnessin the video text includes psychological projection: While Loughner commits numerous errors ofvocabulary andsyntax(e.g., conscience dreaming instead of conscious dreaming) he nonetheless denouncesthe majority of peoplewho are illiterate. This suggests grandiosity and scapegoating, both symptomatic of paranoia.I wouldnt be the least bit surprised if it turns out that Loughner had previously been treated for mental illness.UPDATE 5:15 p.m. ET: Donald Douglas at American Power has a round-up on the shooting, including attempts by progressive bloggers to blame Sarah Palin.Linked by Bob Belvedere at the Camp of the Saints  thanks!UPDATE 4:10 p.m. ET: The Associated Press names the suspect apprehended in the shooting as Jared Laughner.UPDATE 4:42 p.m. ET: Commenters below have linked to the YouTube channel of someone named Jared Loughner, who in recent weeks had posted weird videos with semi-literate text about conscience dreaming and new currency. If this Loughner is the gunman in custody, it appears that he is mentally ill. This is eerily similar to Pentagon gunman J. Patrick Bedell. See my March post at the Hot Air Green Room, Whatever Happened to Crazy?UPDATE 4:55 p.m. ET: Ben Smith of Politicouses the term anti-government political views to describe the content of these YouTube videos, but incoherent and cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs might be a more accurate characterization:You dont have to accept hte federalist laws, the video[by Loughner] says; it also insists on the gold and silver standard, talks of revolution, and suggests that the government is imposing mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling grammar. His linked MySpace page, no longer available, included statements about the gold standard and about SWAT teams paying for their equipment with illegal currency. Among his long list of favorite books in his YouTube profile are Mein Kampf, The Communist Manifesto, Siddhartha.As I would note also in reference to the Pentagon shooter Bedell, the political beliefs of the mentally ill are difficult to categorize ideologically. Crazy is not an ideology. When somebody starts babbling word-salad stuff about mind control, etc., the problem is not politics. The problem is that somebody forgot to take their meds.UPDATE 4:20 p.m. ET: A federal judgeand a 9-year-old girl arereportedly among those killed in this incident. Medical authorities have said they are optimistic about Giffords survival.Left Coast Rebel, VodkaPundit and Weasel Zippers are all blogging aboutthis senseless tragedy. Instapundit is also aggregating. Via Memeorandum, we see that progressive blogger TBogg says f*** it, Im going there to blame Sarah Palin.UPDATE4:02 p.m. ET:Troubling news that there may have been more than one gunman. Fox News reports:Initial reports said that Giffords had died but a hospital spokesman and three House sources told Fox News that she remained alive in a nearby hospital where she was undergoing surgery. At least 19 people were shot at Giffords Your Corner event held outside a Safeway grocery store in Tucson, including three members of the Democratic congresswomans staff in Arizona. Five have died and nine are in critical condition at the University of Arizona Medical Center. A suspect is in custody. Authorities are looking for a possible second suspect.But thats just apossible suspect.Theseearly reports are bound to be confusing.For one guy to shoot 19 people would probably require that he have at least two weapons or else an extra-large clip. Will clarify as further news becomes available.UPDATE 3:46 p.m. ET: Interestingly, Giffords was one of the Democrats who didnt vote for Nancy Pelosi as minority leader Wednesday. She voted for Rep. John Lewis, Georgia Democrat and civil-rights hero. Giffordswas barelyre-elected in the 8th District, edging Republican Jesse Kelly by less than 4,000 votes, and only won bycampaigning wellto the right of the Democratic leadershipon immigration and other issues.UPDATE 3:10 p.m. ET: Contradicting earlier reports that Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was dead, the Washington Post now reports that the Arizona Democrat is in surgery and reportedly in critical condition. The number of others wounded or killed is also in dispute. Still no word on the identity of the gunman or his motive.UPDATE 3:25 p.m. ET: As noted below, some are attempting to theorizeapolitical motive in the absence of any actual knowledge. Given that we dont even know at this pointhow many people were shot, or whether theyre dead or alive, it is irresponsible in the extreme to speculate about a motive.The Anchoresswrites: Its kind of disgusting when you hear someone is shot and the first thing you do is try to figure out how to fit the terrible news to your political worldview.Da Tech Guy recalls the Bill Sparkman fiasco.Linked by the Lonely Conservative  thanks! Ive also been on the phone with Da Tech Guy, whose show tonight on WCRN 830 AM willobviously now have to include discussion of this horrible crime.PREVIOUSLY: Democrat Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was among seven people fatally shot at an event in the parking lot of a grocery store. The gunman, described as being in his late teens or early 20s, is in custody.Ed Morrissey has been aggregating the story for more than an hour.UPDATE: According to the New York Times, Giffords spokesman said she was shot point blank in the head. The total number of people reportedly killed or injured is 12.No word yet on a motive, but . . . point-blank in the head?The word for thatisassassination.UPDATE II: Joel Achenbach of the Washington Post notes that some Daily Kos commenters appear to be trying to blame this on . . . wait for it . . . Sarah Palin.UPDATE III: Regardless of who perpetrated this outrage or why, its terribly harmful to the political process.While I was on Capitol Hill for swearing-in events Wednesday, I saw Democrat Rep. Raul Grijalva (AZ-7) walk past on the sidewalk. He was walking alone, with no aides or anybody else with him. I said hello, smiled and waved.Every regular reader here knows how enthusiastically I covered Republican Ruth McClungs challenge to Grijalva in the election.But its just politics, people!No matter how intense the debate or how serious the issues, no oneought to fear for their safety merely because they become involved in the political process, either as an elected official or any other capacity.

Giffords Survives Tucson Shooting; headline. daveinbocaI tuned in for a minute to another demented soul named Keith Olbermann who laid the blame squarely on the Fox network and Republicans.   The show after this airhead loudmouth was LockUp, where he should spend time with fellow P.O.S. Loughner.As for Ms. Giffords, I saw her on C-Span reading the Constitution with reverence and understand she refused to vote for Nancy Polizzi for Minority Leader, but voted for civil rights leader John Lewis instead.   Too bad such a fine woman was attacked by a madman and Im hoping shell recover with her full capabilities.   Her astronaut husband is due to make a Shuttle mission very soon.  So very sad.   But the moonbats who were completely silent when the Panama City FL murderer wannabe Duke was shown to be a libtard who quoted Think Process and Media Mutters, are now squeaking in their usual manner about this nutjobsaying he was a right-winger. http://streetsweeperchronicles.blogspot.com/ Streetsweeper95bFound a blog by BlueBoy located on DailyKos here:http://boyblue.dailykos.com/ http://theothermccain.com/2011/01/09/text-of-memo-from-the-department-of-homeland-security-on-arizona-shooting/ Text of Memo From the Department of Homeland Security on Arizona Shooting : The Other McCain[...] Is Not ReportingArizona Shooter Seems to Be Someone Desperately Needing Mental Health CareARIZONA OUTRAGE: Rep.
