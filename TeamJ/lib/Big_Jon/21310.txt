Obviously, friends of the dog park dont want there to be any more.The appeal:PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont bring your dogs to this park if they are in any way unsocialized or aggressive. And please dont bring your smaller to medium sized dogs to this park as it can be extremely unsafe and even fatal. According to the vet this isnt the first time a small dog has been brutally killed at these types of parks. Also watch out for that Husky as it is likely dangerous towards other pets now. I would hate for anyone to be going through what I am going through. That dog was my baby, he was a part of our family. We are all beyond upset, including our other dog; his best friend. This was our little family. Know your rights. There is very little action that can be done. Dogs are considered personal property. Dogs need to be more protected than this. They are family members to most people, as ours was to us. Carrie GarrettFor more info contact dogparkfriends@cox.nethat tip to Sharon JacksonShare|Did you find this article interesting?

You post a ridiculous comment then you apologize for it. Why post it in the first place?

You have the freedom to say whatever you want, but the Rag doesnt have to provide you a platform.Replydoug porterJuly 7, 2010 at 10:26 amthats right abby. the first amendment to the constitution refers to Government suppression of free speech. during the picket line at the Black, I was appalled that some of the counter-protesters thought that a boycott of the Black or calling for this sticker to be removed from sale was a First Amendment issue. Since there was no government involved and nobody was even asking the government to intervene, this argument was merely more proof of the ignorance that some people have about how our system works.Replymr freshJuly 5, 2010 at 2:37 pmonly dogs that drink alcohol and panhandle should be banned.ReplyMarilyn SteberJuly 5, 2010 at 5:48 pmEven though we live only a block away from Dusty Rhodes dog park, we dont go there because of aggressive dogs.  After an owner refused to see her big black dogs (Bouvier  des Flanders?)  were aggressing a boxer puppy we saw the manner of things.The small dog park in Pacific Beach is not monitored either, and we left there because of dogs clearly over the height/weight limit: a pitty with bad manners, and a Coton de Tulear with even worse manners.It is a joy to see a dog running off leash.

Whoever is responsible for this mess, must be a complete moron.I am amazed this young woman would bring thattiny dog into a dogpark with large dogs.Bill Zardus  ..ccdogpark at YahooDotCom  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Dogpark-National-News/ReplyjohnJuly 30, 2010 at 11:32 pmSo Bill I was wondering, is this the kind of expert help you give everyone who suffers the loss of an animal they consider a family member- post something toned down and civil on their local blog here then behind their back on your own blog post this unedited version?Zeus is the fifth small dog to be fatally attackedat this dog park in the seven years it has been open.unquoteWow ! Whoever is responsible for this mess, mustbe a complete moron.I am amazed this young woman would bring that tinydog into a dogpark with large dogs. And then ofcourse she wants to blame this incident on everyonebut herself.If it was up to me, dopes like Carrie would beprosecuted for abusing their own dog.Bill Zardus ..ccdogpark at YahooDotCom -Wow! dopes like Carrie? While I would offer it was not a good idea to have a tiny dog playing with the big boys, you should at least sympathize with her loss as more naivity than negligence.Or perhaps you forgot your own advice to yourself?And some of you wonder why I say: poorly designeddog parks are dangerous !!!5 dogs killed and all of them, small dogs.Well that certainly is a coincidence, ehh.It is hard to put into words how angry these storiesmake me, but I should probably take some time and calmdown before posting my online comments.Im really having a hard time seeing you as good with dogs, Bill, with a temper like that and such a propensity to be irrational and downright mean to others. However these revelations about your troubled personality really frame those comments about my opinions being crazy.  Another field where we should step aside for your expertise! Bill, lighten up. If you arent having fun its not worth doing! Now that this is all out of the way in the interests of those with the small dogs, I see you are deeply involved in this issue and thus are an expert- can you give me a candid answer because you WILL naturally have been exposed to more information on this than any of us and I dont have the hours to put into researching it:Should a small dog get in the jaws of a large one, even heaven forbid a pit bull- what are the various means, albeit understandably dangerous, which could be employed by each of their owners to intercede? Even if you disagree and feel the issue should be addressed by separation, cast this aside and consider that while many would not get near a snarling large dog others would risk their own safety for that of their dog. The large dog owner would get a safer advantage and there are methods to relax his bite.I think this information should be available to those who wish to learn it, even myself who am on the Dog Beach Jetty almost daily as its virtually my yard, but not currently a dog owner, would like not to feel helpless and stand by doing nothing.ReplyCarrieJuly 6, 2010 at 12:40 amThank you for posting this, I was just informed. If anyone wants to get involved please call the city parks to help get the small area built, as it has been approved and been not implemented. Zeus was fatality number 5 I am finding out. Lets try to prevent number 6 at this park. (619) 525-8213 is the city parks. I dont have an email for them. Bigs and smalls want to play, socialize, and run, and having a safe place, and having to self monitor is the only way this can happen without these preventable tragedies. Also thanks for getting the word out to small dog owners, cause I might have thought thought twice to bringing my small dogs to a mixed park. I cant describe the guilt, pain, and anger I am going through. Its surreal. Thank you. CarrieReplyOB CindiJuly 8, 2010 at 10:00 amCarrie, my heart goes out to you.  Please dont beat yourself up over Zeus.  Were you able to notify the Humane Society of the incident and the Huskys Dog License number?  If you want to protect the other Zeus of San Diego, please take this woman to court and work with the Humane Society to get this woman prosecuted and never allowed to own another dog.  I always say parenting and dog ownership are a PRIVILEGE, not a right.  We have to prove we can drive before we get a drivers license, we have to prove we can teach by getting a Masters in Education, but we dont have to prove we can be a good dog owner or parent before we become one.  On a side note, I used to be one of the people who walked her dog off leash around OB.  My dog listens well and I always thought A dog off leash is clearly friendly.  I learned from the woman sitting next to me at the Sacred Heart meeting on the homeless on Tuesday night, how scary it can be to have even a small dog off leash come up to your grandson if you are afraid of dogs.  I made a vow to never walk my dog off leash again.  Safety for my dog, and a safe feeling for my neighbors.  I can agree to that!!!ReplyKenlocJuly 9, 2010 at 12:21 pmMany dogs who are off leash come up to my small dog who is on a leash.The owner will often tell me their dog is friendly.The problem is my little guy is not that friendly.I worry he will growl and bark at a unleashedfriendly dog and get hurt. Ive also seen unleashed dogs sprint across the street to greet my dog.Very dangerous.Replyparadox zapJuly 11, 2010 at 10:14 amI so appreciate Cindis comments. Although both incidents for us involved pit bulls, it has changed  me into a person who is fearful of all off-leash dogs.  It absolutely is all about the spirit of being good neighbors.Replyparadox zapJuly 6, 2010 at 5:50 amThat is terrible! I too have stopped going to Dusty Rhodes dog park because of irresponsible, insensitive ownersand I own a big greyhound.  I now plan to drive over twenty miles  when time allows so that my dog can have an opportunity to run and play safely off leash. Shoot, at this point we cant even go for walks in our neighborhood without fear of encountering aggressive dogs whose owners are letting them walk off leash. I love living in OB,  but in the last six months my hound (while on leash and under my full control) has been viciously attacked by unleashed pit bulls (neither were owned by a person who was homeless).  To end on a more positive note. I am grateful to the good Samaritans who selflessly came to our aid during the most recent attack. I didnt get any of your names but again, I say Thank You for being such caring and helpful neighbors.now that is the OB Spirit I know and love!ReplyDebbieJuly 6, 2010 at 9:56 amAnyone interested please attend the next Dusty Rhodes park meeting on July 22nd 5:30 p.m. at the OB Rec Center and share your thoughts, comments or suggestions by contacting: Park Dept. Director SLomedico@sandiego.gov and City Council Rep:  kevinfaulconer@sandiego.gov and call the rec center area director Monica Honor 619-531-1527 and San Diego County Animal Control (619) 767-2675.I am aware of an attack on 12/2/07 and have no details on other attacks.  Here are the words of the owner:Hi, thanks for the call today regarding the tragic attack on my dog.  It occured on December 2nd at approximatly 4 p.m..  I am a frequent visitor to Dusty Rhodes Dog Park, as I have (had) three dogs, Max, a black lab, and our two Chorkies (1/2 chuwawa, 1/2 yorkies).  Max is a very playful and energetic 11 month old lab, who loves to run and interact with other dogs at the park.  My Chorkies love the park as well, but are small, and thus I do not allow them to be off their leashes.  As Max plays, we watch him and walk around the perimeter of the fence line.  On the day of the attack we were along the west side of the park watching Max play with another dog.  As I held the leashes and the Chorkies walked with me a large Huskie came up from our backside and bit down on Mini, the smaller of the two.  She let out a loud, shreeking noise.  I quickly picked her up and rushed her to my car, as I could see her going into shock.  As I rushed her to the emergency animal hospital off Taylor St., I could see her fighting for her life as I pumped her little chest to keep her heart going.  She died at the hospital from internal bleeding.>After I left the hospital I returned to the park to look for the Husky. I saw two that were there and I spoke with both owners, who did not see the attack and assured me that it was not their dog who had been the attacker.  I then went home and typed up the signs that are posted at the park.  The next day I recieved a call from a witness,who said he saw a young lady in her early twenties leave the park with the dog who attacked Mini quickly after I had gone to the animal hospital.  She and her dog he had recognized from previous visits.  No one had taken down her information, and no one has see her or the dog since (I have called the witness back a couple of times over the past week and and half). I plead with you and the Dusty Rhodes park council to please open up a section of the park for small dogs.  Our little dogs would love to run and play like the bigger dogs, but it just is not safe.  It is not so much the attacks, as it is smaller dogs are at a greater risk of being trampled and run over and injured by the larger dogs.  I hope that no one ever has to go through the tragic loss of a beloved family pet like we have had to endure.  Little Mini was just one year old and full of life and love.  She was my five year old daughters favorite dog and the one she called hers.  Going home and having to explain the loss Mini broke her heart, my wifes and mine.  We are doing  better each day, but it still is hard and very upsetting.  I walked out of that emergency animal hospital without Mini, a $300 bill and no one who would take responsibility for their dogs actionsReplyCarrie GarrettJuly 6, 2010 at 3:09 pmDebbie- Please contact me personally, I wonder if its the same dog. carriejgarrett@gmail.comReplyLuv da CapeJuly 6, 2010 at 11:13 amCarrie, my heart hurts for you and your other pup.  Please dont pay attention to the rude people who are trying to blame you for this horrible tragedy.  The only people at fault here are the owners of the aggressive dog.  You have every right to bring your dog to the park so he can run around freely.  I have a chihuahua and she LOVES the dog park and LOVES other dogsbig and small.  Are we supposed to keep our good, well behaved dogs on leashes all the time because OTHER owners are irresponsible? I think most dog owners are responsible and I havent had a bad experience at the dog park yet but there are obviously exceptions like these.  We cant live our life in fear all the time.  However, one thing we can do is support opening a small dog park in OB.  I wonder if there is a way to help it move forward in addition to making calls?  Even with a small dog park, aggressive dogs will always be a danger at the dog parkits not only small dogs that get killed or maimed.  And its not just at the park, as paradox zap said, dogs get attacked while on the leash just walking on the sidewalk.  Maybe we should have a Dusty Rhodes/OB Aggressive Dog web site where we can post pictures of aggressive dogs and their owners! A little public embarrassment and some prior knowledge of what these dogs and their owners look like would be very helpful!  I dont know how to set it upperhaps Frank can make a page on the Rag? Thoughts?ReplyLuv da CapeJuly 6, 2010 at 11:20 amDebbie, Thank you for the additional information. I will be at that meeting and will be making calls. Thank you!ReplyJennafuraJuly 6, 2010 at 12:14 pmI have a dog. LOVE him to death.I rarely take him to these parks anymore because I have seen how other owners treat their dogsEven at Coronado, a woman who was NEXT to her dogwhile hers kept running up to mine and biting him in the NECK, did nothing. Not even apologize to me. I had  and always keep my guy on a leash even at dog parks because of other owners.Dogs are dogs, you can not trust them. It is the owners responsibility to be mindful, not the animals, they react instinctively. That is something no matter how well trained your pet is that you can not remove from their personality. You cant just go to the park, let them run wild and expect when you are not looking that they will be the angel that they are at home.You are the lead dog in the pack. Act like it. BAD OWNERS (shaking my fist at you).Carrie I am very sorry for your loss. I dont know how I would be dealing with that had it been me. Thank you for your communication on the issue to all of us. It could have even been someones baby. Whos to say that Husky will be able to be that selective to not know the difference.ReplyBrendaJuly 6, 2010 at 3:20 pmI am so sorry for your tragic and traumatic loss.  Thank you for making your experience known.  Since we cant make people more smart about their dogs aggressiveness, we need to educate ourselves on 1) the signs of a potentially dangerous dog or dog situation 2) the best way to keep our small dogs safe 3) measuring the risks with the fun of a visit to the dog park.   I think, short of never leaving the house, you did everything you could reasonably do to protect your dog.Your openess may allow Zeus to make one last contribution by encouraging us to find even more ways to protect the little ones.  I hope more of us will follow your example and communicate with each other at the park, town meetings, or even signs like yours on the fence.   Also, Since so many of us have cell phones with cameras, let us all consider taking more pictures of situations that happen around us.  Im glad to see the OB Rag able to support this communication too,ReplyDebbieJuly 6, 2010 at 8:47 pmIn past meetings, I suggested a lock box at the park so visitors could write in comments or report incidents which would be reviewed future meetings.  The park has grown in size and number of visitors since its opening.  The more feedback and information that is received will only make the park better and safer.  Based on the last incident, its important for people to document what they saw to assist injured parties and law enforcement.ReplyBlack lab water beautyJuly 9, 2010 at 10:34 amI had an experince in North park where a pit bull bit the hell out of my boy.  I kicked his dog so damn hard I think it cracked a rib and I punched the owner in the face a few times when he came at me.  I think it was handled well.In my experience, the little dogs tend to be the more unsocialized  and aggresive in the parks.   Props to ClubSyleDJ, keep regulation away.  This place we live is soooooo way over regulated.  Handle it yourself.  I dont want to have to think about or acknowledge (little yappy napoleon dog rights).   Sucks about your puppy.  If it had been my dog killed, I would have asked the Husky owner to put his dog down or I would do it for him.ReplySan Diego HighwaymanJuly 11, 2010 at 9:49 pmCarrieSO sorry fer yer loss!I was there that day but apparently had left afore yer pooch was attacked  [ heard bout it the next day    ]if Ida seen it I woulda intervened  carry a heavy walkin stick I do  also pepper spray  used the stick coupla times in the past to dissuade aggressive dogs my heartfelt condolances to ya ReplySpottedinSDJuly 12, 2010 at 10:01 amI am a faithful regular of DRDP, have been since my Dalmatian completed ALL of her puppy shots. The recent tragedy at the park is terrible and I feel for both the owners. Dogs of all sizes can be aggressive, and unfortunately dog parks can be a dangerous place, for dogs and their parents.My own dog has been hurt here, as well as at other dog parks in the city, and although I monitor my dog and her behavior, I know that its a dog park, and stuff happens. We have to remember that its not just the dogs its the owners too that must share the blame when incidents happen.As dog owners we MUST be more responsible for the behavior of our dogs as well as ourselves. So thinking in those terms, here are my top 5 rules for the dog park:1. Pick up after your dogs2. Stop talking on your cell phone and being oblivious to your surroundings and whats going on with your dog3. If your dog is toy obsessed, dont bring toys4. Dont bring your puppy until its had all of its shots5. Pick up after your dogs (warrants saying it again)Dog parks and beaches are a privilege, one that can most certainly be taken away if we as dog owners dont start policing ourselves.ReplyOB CindiJuly 13, 2010 at 10:28 amCarrieI wonder if we can work with OB Dog Wash and those who attend the meeting on July 22nd to get people to do a Paddle Out for Zeus.  Invite the media.  Get attention to what happened, and more importantly, what are plans are to stop this tragedy from happening again.  Can we put fence in a corner of DRDP for little dogs?  Have people send funds to Carrie for an area called Zeuss Little Dog Run.just a thoughttoo pie in the sky?ReplyCarrie GarrettJuly 13, 2010 at 3:06 pmOB Cindi-Awe a Paddle Out wold be awesome. I have contacted the media on the tragedy and the meeting. The small dog park has been approved for some years at DRDP. I am not sure why the fence hasnt been put up. I hope this incident is what will make the ground break. I have asked what I need to do to help with that. I also have asked what I need to do to get a dedication to Zeus and all the rest of the small dogs who have lost their lives unnecessarily. I hope to get answers at the meeting.ReplyDebbieJuly 15, 2010 at 6:50 pmfyi http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jul/15/san-diego-moving-crack-down-leash-parks/ReplyJBlazeJuly 18, 2010 at 8:03 pmToday 7-18-2010 another little dog was mashed and thrashed by a pitbull about 1 or so..  Some of these imperial valley/el centro pit breeders think its cool to show thier muscle off down here, sure shit happens, but when death happens, it is, its usually a pit..  Fuck what the owners and pros say.  These dogs are unpredictable to say the least Ive been around em for 48 years and its always usually a pit dickin with something or someone.  They are overly protective and sure as hell a shitty idea to bring them down to dogs to mingle, especially when they got thier nuts flowin in the wind. keep the vibe better down here and make wiser decisions on what you bring to the beach and quit trying to be the tough guy or girl that thinks thier shit dont stink cause they got a pitReplyDebbieJuly 19, 2010 at 7:54 amReminder.meeting about this park on Thursday July 22nd 5:30 p.m. at the OB Rec Center and share your thoughts, comments or suggestions.  If you cant come post your thoughts here for the Rec Committee and city to read.  Maybe the park should be closed until the small dog area is installed?????ReplyCarrie GarrettJuly 19, 2010 at 10:38 amFrom the City-I want to start off by saying Im sorry you have experienced the loss of your dog.  Nothing can change what you went through but I would like you to know that we are working to ensure no one else has to go through a similar experience.  As you may know, the Dusty Rhodes Recreation Council has been working with the City of San Diego over the past several years to expand the dog park and create separate enclosures for large and small dogs among other projects. While we understand the desire for immediate action, the improvement to the dog park must be approved by the City Council which is in recess in August.  The earliest the item can be heard is September and the improvements must meet the guidelines set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act.  City staff is processing a request for action for City Council to place the item on the docket.Please know that City staff and Dusty Rhodes Recreation Council members are currently are working together to finalize this project.  Please feel free to contact me at 619-531-1527 if you have any questions.Thank you,Monica HonorCity of San Diego, Park and Recreation DepartmentPeninsula Area, Area Manager MS 324726 Santa Monica AvenueSan Diego, CA  92107MHonore@sandiego.govReplyCarrie GarrettJuly 19, 2010 at 10:40 amJBlaze-Did this happen at the Dusty Rhodes Park or at Dog Beach? What exactly happened? Did the little one make it or DOA?ReplyjohnJuly 29, 2010 at 7:43 pmI think its been established that its not an inherent problem with the breed itself but the compounding factors of:Those likely to own them are of a personality that is both  irresponsible and enjoy having an animal that is a phallic extension or replacement for what they lack in self esteem, and:The breed is of such physical strength that when things DO go wrong the consequences are always tragic, no maybes or close calls.Statistically obscured by the fact reports of dog attacks are skewed by anything even resembling the breed, being called a pit bull in police reports when the attacking animal runs away.Im making the point because I have seen pits and their sub breeds brought up by conscientious owners in loving families and you are more likely to get hurt by grandmas westie or cocker spaniel (each a breed that has had a reported fatal attack, see: http://www.dogbitelaw.com/breeds-causing-DBRFs.pdf  ) than youd be by their dogs. The bad name they have is justified but its not because of the dog itself.ReplyCarrie GarrettJuly 19, 2010 at 10:47 amMy suggestion since nothing can be done immediately and this is a problem is to have days where smalls can come and days where bigs can come. That would be at ALL dog parks in San Diego that are a mixed free for all. This would protect owners and their pets. Bigs could have 4-5 days a week and smalls 2 to 3 days a week. Or it could be an even 3 and 3 and one day a free for all with posted do this at your own risk cause deaths happen.ReplyjayJuly 20, 2010 at 4:41 pmHi carrie, this happened at dog beach right by stubs jetty.  The owner of the smaller dog that was killed got info on the female owner of the pitbull right after the attack, and believe me, lots of people saw this.  As far as I know, after that she left with her dog.  About an hour or so later, I saw the guy whos dog was killed, talking to a lifegaurd at the tower by dog beach..  He told them that he could not get the lady on the phone and presumed she gave him a wrong number  If this is true this kind of act makes me sick to think that her dog just killed another dog and she has zero class to take responsibility cause she knows he would sue the shit out of her.  I sure would!!!!p.s.  The lifegaurd told me after I went and talked to him said,   everytime it seems that something bad happens at dogs, a pitbull is involved, not saying that other dogs dont get into fights, but the death here has been primarily pits.ReplySan Diego HighwaymanJuly 20, 2010 at 6:54 pmUnfortunately, there are people out there who SUCK as people and dont do the right thing  [ like givin a false phone # ] If one witnesses an incident like this, it would behoove one to DO something even if one is not actually involved something could be to call it in  follow the perp [ person responsible ] to their vehicle and write down the licence #  description  make an account of what you witnessed and present it to the the victim  by all means, if you have a phone-cam or video  USE it to help the victim  youd appreciate someone doin it for YOU if *you* were a victim wouldnt you? above all  be watchfull of your dogs actions and other dogs approachin yersI carry a walkin stick and pepper spray  pepper spray I havent hadta use as yit  but the walkin stick has come in handy on a coupla occasions  what if it was YER dog killed or maimed ??ReplyjohnJuly 29, 2010 at 8:04 pmSue the shit out of her. For what? Replacement value of the dog? Pain and suffering and punitive damage? How do you know who started the fight, do we just assume the side of the smaller dog because of societys aversion to bullying, dismissing that small dogs are the ones who usually bite first and bark later?Heres something that happened to me once, driving home from work one afternoon Im going  west on W. Pt. Loma at Cable at the posted speed limit and darting right in front of me is a medium size dog chasing a ball, I go full brakes but hit him hard and he goes rolling, yelping, and I see him running on three legs as he runs back to the open yard of the apartment complex but cant see where he goes from there- so I know hes got care and frankly I have to pee so bad Im crossing my legs and head the last 3 blocks home, and greet MY dog in the yard where hes supposed to be.Still the welfare of the dog is bothering me, so much that I have already forgotten that I looked at the front bumper of my Corvette and notice its got several hundred dollars in damage to the paint.So I go back to said apartment building and ask around, two people are there to talk to me. One is a hysterical woman who tells me the dog belongs to her and her sister, and shes going to sue me for damages because the dogs leg is broken and her sister is at the vet, the second is the hillbilly boyfriend/brother? of the other sister who she calls over from his apartment to have him hold me down so I cant leave till the police come.I look at him, point at her with one hand and make the crazy gesture with the finger roatating next to the head with the other. Luckily he fully agrees and is not as inbred as Id feared and tells her to shut her mouth and go inside. He says he saw the whole thing and has been warning them this could happen and it did. He understands I just came back out of concern for the dog and tells me hes sorry about the damage to the car, realizing Im the one with the case should I pursue it.I could easily see if Id given my phone number to these people and the guy been as dimwitted as he first appeared, giving them my number would have resulted in my car being vandalized and probably much worse, as in their minds they think I  was the bad guy.So dont assume that this girl not giving up her number makes her a bad person when we only know part of the story.ReplyZeyJuly 22, 2010 at 7:24 pmIf there is ever a vote on creating a small dog park you got my vote. I just got back from DRDP and my poor little pup was not able to have any fun do to the fact that all the bigger dogs were bugging him. We need a small dog park asap!ReplyAndra LooJuly 28, 2010 at 12:21 pmI live in south OB and have been making the 12 mile round trip almost daily to the small dog park in PBCapehart Park at the foot of Mt Soledad.  I own a 5 lb Yorkie and a 12lb Dachshund/Pomeranian mix.  Knowing my littlest one has a bit of a Napoleon-complex and may be seen as prey to bigger dogs, I make the drive so they can both run and play freely.  While there have, on rare occasions, been dogs clearly above the 30 lb limit, they are usually puppies or older dogs, and if asked to leave, the owners willing comply.  The owners are very conscientious  and keep their eyes on their dogs and are quick to stop any disagreements that may occur between the dogs.  I will miss these people and their dogs when the small dog area is opened at Dusty Rhodes but will be more than happy to not make the drive to PB  and stay in my own community.ReplyjohnJuly 29, 2010 at 7:25 pmI can see the further complications in this who will decide what defines large dogs from small owners of small medium dogs putting their 30lb dogs in with 4.5 lb pomeranians and trendy breed-of-the-month teacup/purse dogs who will still be mini-mes in the mouths of giants. It reaches absurdity with someone also calling for separate entrances for the sizes? Why, so those who are irresponsible and open the car door for fido to run free in the lot can continue this practice thinking its okay? (I see this alot in the dog beach parking lot)Im also wondering if this isnt going to be a green light for those who have large aggressive dogs who knew that and didnt bring them down before, or did and saw the potential for liability to now do so and see an increase in dog injuries to the rest of the medium and larger dogs they run with.I think what it comes down to is everyone wants to see an off the leash dog run where THEIR dog is accomodated and can enjoy themselves in complete safety, forgetting that due to the wide diversity in both breeds and their owners, such a thing is virtually impossible. If they push too hard tinkering with existing facilities and demanding action to accomodate the fringe (ahem, the little Pomeranian, as darling as Im sure he was and I have great sympathy for your loss) the end result will simply be the city closing the whole thing down for everyone if it gets too complicated trying to please everyone,  or an expensive liability.So think that over, I can see it coming to that quite easily with the citys present economic state.ReplyjohnJuly 29, 2010 at 8:51 pmIt dawns on me after doing  further research into this that an equally effective protection for EVERYONEs dogs here is not simply separation but an EDUCATION starting on the ways that dogs can be separated when attacks occur, not simply standing by helplessly watching.Two links:http://www.bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/37069754.htmlthat tells the story of a 9 year old that subdues a powerful animal with a choke hold, and this link tells of a story similar to the problem were having locally:http://gowanuslounge.blogspot.com/2007/10/dog-attacks-kills-another-dog-at-dog.htmlwith links to further discussions about breaking sticks being employed by pit bull owners to have their dogs instantly release other animals. Other suggestions include pepper spray and shoving a stick into the anus of the larger dog to get him to release.Have any of you with smaller dogs considered packing a small pepper spray can with you to save the life of your dog if the worst happened? Seems like common sense to me and if in fact it is effective maybe this should be posted conspicuously at both leash frees areas immediately. I cant see how standing by helplessly and maybe yelling no at the dogs has passed for effective practice for so long when there are probably proven ways to deal with this.ReplyOB CindiJuly 29, 2010 at 11:01 pmGod forbid the dog you hit and ran, should scratch your precious Corvette paint job. You should have sued the dog.ReplyjohnJuly 30, 2010 at 1:19 amYoure right, I could have, there is plenty of precedent in civil law court decisions to support that and I thought that was pretty clear in my comments- however I never considered it for a moment.I get the unmistaken feeling your two comments in reply to me are relaying a caustic attitude to me personally which their content do not warrant.  Perhaps you have some problem with something I have said about a completely unrelated matter here at the rag. If this is true please accept my apology for whatever I said which  could cause such petty and immature behaviour. Its downright silly to not assume two people who disagree on one issue cannot share common ground and have progressive discourse on another.If I am wrong about that then let me offer my unconditional apology and attempt to clarify what it was in this topic I said that has caused this.On the off chance its motivated by an irrational hatred for Corvettes Ill just go ahead and say **** my ******* **** *** ****** ****.  Use your imagination, this is an all ages access site.That car has one of the cleanest emissions profiles in the industry,  gets 25 mpg, and is nearly 100% US made.I think I covered all the bases.ReplyOB CindiJuly 29, 2010 at 11:31 pmToo bad the dog wasnt a 3 year old. You could have sued the hick parents for the Corvette paint damage John.ReplyBill ZardusJuly 30, 2010 at 11:42 amJohn:Please find something more useful to do with your time than posting all of these crazy opinions.   You know enough about this issue to be dangerous and I have serious questions about your intelligence.I have already given Carrie 2 easy solutions to this problem and you can go back to doing whatever the hell it is you do, when you are not posting crazyopinions about things you obviously dont understand.If I was there, I would also want the parks director fired if  5 small dogswere really killed at one dogpark.WRZ  .ccdogpark@yahoo.com  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Toy-Dogs/  .http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Dogpark-National-News/  ..ReplyjohnJuly 30, 2010 at 7:38 pmBill, your personal attacks are not only unwarranted it is evident from numerous posts in your own newsgroup forum, particularly this thread:http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dogpark-National-News/message/1807that the last person who should be affixing labels to anyones posts which suggest mental illness, is you. However I will ignore the rudeness and give you the opportunity to explain to me and for the benefit of those whose might otherwise see their dogs shaken to death in the jaws of a larger more powerful animal, helpless but to yell no and watch in horror, what exactly was so CRAZY about suggesting people research the possible ways that they could intervene and stop a dog from killing another? Offering links to discussions which had links to qualified people detailing a well known way to get a pit bull to instantly release anything in its jaws? Suggesting they carry a pepper spray can that costs a few dollars and is proven effective at incapacitating a dog temporarily?  Is every USPS letter carrier in America crazy, Bill?Nothing I posted rejected your solutions, Bill, but suggested that other directions could also be helpful as well.Did I challenge your perceived position of authority, Bill? I have owned several dogs, used to breed Shar-peis, was a member of the SD county Shar-pei club, and raised a wonderful shepherd mix from 5 wks as a puppy until his death two years ago at age 11, the whole time living so close to dog beach I can hit it throwing a baseball. I know a little about dogs and leash free areas, this is my backyard many of you are playing in.So whether your problem is my rambling posting style and your inability to read with the comprehension skills to find a valuable point within, (making us both at fault I concede) or youre having a bad day due to other factors, I dont know.I think if Carrie had pepper spray and the owner of that or any large dog had a breaking stick and knew what to do with it that day her dog would surely be alive now, and its irresponsible for anyone to prevent others to  not at least review these possibly effective actions they could take.ReplyOB CindiJuly 30, 2010 at 6:48 pmJohn-CA DMV law states a driver of a class C vehicle is responsible for avoiding contact with pedestrians. When driving, you are to do the posted limit, and scan the road and side of road for potential things that could move out in front of you. So your previous crazy posts including those that were removed for their inappropriate content, tells us two things about you. 1) You need your drivers license taken away for committing a hit-and-run. 2) You are a class act for only returning to the scene of the crime when you felt your uncompassionate behavior further warranted monetary reimbursment.When driving in my town of OB, please do the speed limit to be sure to see anyone coming out of an alley or a neighbors pet or god forbid, a child who runs from their parent into your cars path. Please dont drink and drive. And if you make contact with something, stop, show compassion, and HELP. Driving away is NEVER the solution to a vehicle accident (whether involving an animal, person or inanimate object).ReplyjohnJuly 30, 2010 at 8:26 pmCindi, (is that with a little smiley face dotting the i?) maybe its time you and Bill get together and start a therapy group.Those with a more lucid grasp on reality can clearly recognize that:I hit a dog off a leash in city limits its owner had foolishly allowed to chase a ball that had errrantly gone into the path of my traffic lane.A dog is not a child nor a pedestrian for sake of the vehicle code, particularly off a leash in city limits, a further violation of  local law.  I have the right of way in my lane, not a dog running unexpectedly out from between cars chasing a ball.I clearly staterd I was travelling at the posted speed limit. Can you read plain English or did you attempt  to insult everyone here by assuming they could not?Hit and run does not apply, particularly to an off the leash dog that ran to its owner- yet I stopped and assured myself the animal had human care. and quickly returned. I was NOT going to piss my pants because some idiot is an irresponsible dog owner.Furthermore every post I entered on the matter appears on my end, you arent staff here and while I concede (to staff, not to you) that reply was rather blunt to say the least I believe it was within the stated posting rules here, purposely withheld profanity in a way no child could decipher, and its tone more than warranted by the irrelevant disruptively intended posts by yourself against me.People can disagree with the content, but it is clear I never post here without intending to contribute positively to the topical discussion. You cannot make such a quialifier about those two posts, you were looking to start trouble, and continue with your last silly rebuttal.And yet you have ignored the whole point of that post. That dogs owner was in the wrong in nearly every aspect of that situation. Without the introduction of common sense by an interested known person (the B/F or bro) had I unwittingly given them contact information and they were left to act on their own emotions there is no telling what they might do, and people do some really extreme things today. Stalking, arson, assault and battery, even murder, let the courts figure out who was at fault? Only if the witnesses are sympathetic to you. Yet despite your contemptuous skew it was for reimbursement which is absurd, I was stand up about it and checked on the dog. I know the law, you obviously see the law of Fantasyland.W. Pt. Loma at Cable travelling east on any warm late afternoon  has traffic lined up from Sunset Cliffs past Cable halfway back to Bacon. Going West that means you have a line of stopped cars nut to butt immediately over the double yellow to your left and the sun in your eyes. This gave me 3-4 feet of a dog running fast from behind a stopped car from the left with not many more feet in front of me to stop.I defy Michael Schumacher to have cut his speed as fast as I did and will advise you if it were your child instead of that dog I would have knocked them down and gone over them, instead of a dog rebounding  off.If your three year old is playing ball in traffic like that I will stop the car alright, and call the ambulance.Not for the child who will be dead under the cross member or wheels and I dont dare move the car once I establish the severity of injuries is beyond rescue. Itll be for you when those who knew you let your three year old play in a busy street hoping some driver comes by so you can unleash your nutty views on them gives you what you must masochistically desire.Cindi, for the sake of progressive discourse in this blog, please avoid my posts or do so until you relieve whatever  pent up anger initiated this exchange. You will find I hold no grudges and can start anew with nearly anyone.Its just the ****ing internet, my dear.ReplyJennilee HolmanNovember 2, 2010 at 9:40 amI just lost my little dog to wild dogs, it is terrible Im very sorry for your loss.  I have a Siberian and it is important to know your breed.  They are unlike any dog Ive ever had.  They were let free in the summer to fend for themselves by the native people.  Their prey drive is high for little things that look like rabbits.  I wish that other people would understand this about their huskies and not just get them because they are so pretty.  My girl is very sweet but I can tell the difference when she plays with Yorkies, I cant expect her to know the difference between a squirrel and a puppy that looks just like a squirrel, so guess what?  I dont let her play with little dogs!  I wish dog owners would get that.  Again Im sorry.ReplyCancel reply Leave a CommentName *E-mail *WebsiteWant to be notified of follow-up comments by email?
