And while they have largely couched their arguments in moral terms or with references to biblical teachings, top leaders acknowledge another important reason:Latino immigrants, legal and illegal, represent fertile prospects for proselytizing.First and foremost, its a kingdom issue, and, second, its a moral issue, Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, told POLITICO. We have hundreds of thousands of Hispanic Southern Baptists and many of them are undocumented.  Its no secret that we practice aggressive evangelism. Many of these people were converted after they got here.Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, puts it another way. When people migrate, theyre open to all kinds of change, including religious change. Evangelical denominations have historically drawn immigrants.  The growing edge of many of our denominations is through immigration from all over the world.Anderson insisted, however, that his organization was urging the government to act because of broader moral and social concerns  and not to help churches fill their pews.That is a motivation for evangelicals to be involved in this. However, I dont think from a government point of view it should be a religious decision. Its primarily a justice decision and a political decision. Im not suggesting that legislation be based on a benefit for a particular denomination. It should be based on whats practical for America, Anderson said.While the White House hasnt explicitly endorsed the religious conservatives arguments, they were invited and given front-row seats earlier this month when President Barack Obama delivered a speech on immigration reform at American University.Most of the arguments put forward by the conservative religious figures are similar to those of other immigration-reform advocates, including Catholics and left-leaning religious groups. The evangelicals insist that the treatment of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants is inhumane and immoral. They also argue that legalizing the undocumented would improve national security and reduce labor abuses by persuading immigrants to come out of the shadows.However, the evangelical leaders are also advancing a more controversial line of argument: that immigration reform is practical or even desirable because Latinos subscribe to moral and religious values in line with social conservatives.Some evangelicals have stirred the pot further by drawing a contrast between predominantly Christian immigrants to the U.S. and a largely Muslim migration to Western Europe....Posted by Ben Smith 09:19 PMcomments (40)comments closedpermalinkpost a commentName:Comments:Commenting is disabled on Posts older than 3 days.Post CommentBack to topShare this ArticleDiggDeliciousRedditYahooFacebookGoogleTechnoratiblog commentsReader Comments (40)Pages1Yes!

But, I thought that all illegals were murderers, drug dealers, Hispanics that break the law!!! I'm shocked, shocked I say that most are actually Christians that attend church. At least , that's what the republicans in AZ., well actually almost the whole republican party want you to think. The truth is that crime committed by illegals is DOWN in AZ., and please don't comment about the rancher that was murdered, one murder doesn't mean that every illegal is a criminal murderer, rapist or drug dealer. I've always said I just can't be a hypocrite republican that doesn't follow Jesus' teachings that if you are rich, you give to the poor, if you see a person in need, you help them. Jesus taught that it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. Besides, if you really want to stop illegals from crossing the border, the simple solution would be is to fine the businesses or people that hire them. I'm not talking some measly thousand dollar fine, I'm talking something that would really deter them and hurt them so that they wouldn't even chance it.

America, by virtue of being a bible believing Christian, Christianity implores us to be honest.  Not coming forward and admitting that you came into our great Republic illegally - you are lying!  Churches are not attempting to prosylize .for Christianity.  Most Latinos are already Catholics!  I would think that these churches are those that are trying to appear to be 'politically correct' and standiing upon their righteousness in helping the poor and oppressed to appear noble!   But they are not poor and oppressed because Americans are keeping them that way, they are where they are because they are ILLEGAL and these leaders should be caring more about this aspect before worrying about the other!  These ministers of the scriptures should be more inclined to implore the illegals to return home and come in the legal way!  GOD does not condone the breaking of the laws of the land.  Doing so also breaks GOD's law!  They need to go back and read their scriptures,  again, Christ also said the poor you will have with you always!  We are not treating illegals wrongly by sending them home, we are upholding the laws of our land!

Every peso counts.Posted By: Paul in NH | July 19, 2010 at 11:05 PMReport AbuseEileen you idiot twit, the ONLY reason that the illegals come here is because they know they can find a job to send money back home to their families. If you stop people and businesses from giving them work, then you stop them from coming. Obviously businesses don't want this stopped because they can pay the illegals inferior wages, helping themselves to pad their own bank accounts!! And think again about why the churches are doing this, it has nothing to with being "politically correct" but it does have something to do with the collection plates for the offerings that are passed around. Get a clue!!!Posted By: far right wack jobs | July 19, 2010 at 11:15 PMReport Abuse'LAME DUCK' FOR THANKSGIVING...GUARANTEED!!!  Dear right wack jobs at 11:15 PM...thank you for your insight...I stand with my original comment!  Illegal is illegal.  if I do anything illegal, I can be prosecuted for it and they should be!  My grandparents were immigrants...legal immigrants to America many, many years ago.  They had to have a sponsor, they had to have a job lined up by that sponsor, they had to have a physical to make sure they had no disease...if they did...they were sent back to their country of origin.  They also came here to work due to lack of work in their own land...and sent money back to their families...but they were LEGAL!  They were documented, they were tracked, they had to learn English and mold into the American way and they did!  Then they could apply for citizenship, and they did!  I am proud to say that I am a second generation American...not an "anchor" baby!  I do not deny them entry into America to take advantage all that we 'used' to have before the Democratzi 'loons' took over...but they need to come in the front door in the light of day under the laws of our land!  Not in the dead of the night...breaking the laws of our land the first time they set foot upon our land!  No comprehensive immigration policy...ever!  It would be unfair to all those who are waiting in line to get into our great nation!  Enough said!!!!

In 2008, of the 5.5 million children of unauthorized immigrants, 4 million, or 73%, were born in the United States. . . Nearly half (47%) of unauthorized immigrant households consist of couples with children, compared with 35% of legal immigrant households and only 21% of U.S.-born households. . . The vast majority of all children with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent live in two-parent families (80%). ............. http://www.kgun9.com/Global/story.asp?S=12625650 . . .

Consiter. There are ever fewer and fewer Americans who become members, supporters, and church attendees every year, as ever less Americans believe in what they're peddling, and most Americans don't have big families anymore--as was the case 60-80 years ago. In order to increase the churches membership and coffers, what these churches are doing is smuggling in by hook or crook, every illegal immigrant that manages to sneak accross our borders, and transporting them all accross our country, helping them get settled in by assiting them with housing and jobs. By spreading them all over our country, it  makes it harder for ICE to catch them, and increases the membership of churches that are far away from any US border (rather than have only the border churches get all the benefits).Posted By: DaveH | July 20, 2010 at 03:00 AMReport AbuseSo churches are apologists now?

Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, estimates that the U.S. population will increase by 65 million by 2030, whereas Europe's population will remain "virtually stagnant." Europe, Eberstadt notes, "will by that time have more than twice as many seniors older than 65 than children under 15, with drastic implications for future aging. (Fewer children now means fewer workers later.) . . . the ratio of working-age people to senior citizens in western Europe will drop from 3.8:1 today to just 2.4:1 in 2030. In the U.S., the figure will fall from 5.4:1 to 3.1:1." . . . The only real way to avert this demographic decline is for Europe to take in more immigrants. . . The effects of an aging population are considerable. First, there is the pension burden -- fewer workers supporting more gray-haired elders. . . The United States' potential advantages today are in large part a product of immigration. Without immigration, the United States' GDP growth over the last quarter century would have been the same as Europe's. Native-born white Americans have the same low fertility rates as Europeans.Posted By: Ralph | July 20, 2010 at 03:20 AMReport AbuseWell this was part of the Bush argument for Reform. Nothing new, but we still need to seal the border.Posted By: Mike | July 20, 2010 at 07:19 AMReport AbuseThe doctrine of proselytizing belongs to the dark ages archives; Americans are sick and tired of the wicked and evil strategy of the church to turn people against one another for the purpose of mustering power unto the church and its sick leaders who say one thing and do another.  The Catholic Church is still on trial for its wicked support of crimes committed by priests who have received protection from the Vatican, and this policy is a hard and hurtful slap in the face of honest Catholics who maintain integrity to the core teachings.  Now its the evangelicals who are choosing a greedy and selfish policy aimed at maintaining a divisive and judgmental practice of condemning gay and lesbians for the purpose of keeping its ignorant members emotionally bound to backward and hateful attitudes...and making their hate and divisiveness more important than the core teachings of Jesus.  This is sick, sick politics played out by the Southern Baptists... As a white Southerner with a  g-g-g-g-grandfather who was an early settler and a "hard shell" Baptist minister, I can say with conviction that the church's policy of encouraging hate and prejudice and divisiveness is alive and well and must be confronted and stomped out.  The practice is as stated a prejudice that should be retired to dark ages archives forever and ever.Posted By: Tortoise2 | July 20, 2010 at 07:21 AMReport AbuseOne might also consider the Baptist Big Boys conference held behind closed doors where they consider the benefits of turning illegal immigrants who have been practicing Catholics against that church by drilling them about the evils of the Catholic Church and its criminal priests; it's more of the same hateful and evil practice of drilling their "power" doctrine into the frightened minds of illegal immigrants whom the Baptist profess to protect... Yet, when it comes right down to it, it's about church power, emotional church doctrine of hate and divisiveness, and obviously "church preservation" above the honest and simple consideration for the humanity of these frightened souls.Posted By: Tortoise2 | July 20, 2010 at 07:41 AMReport AbuseBen and Josh...how about a little fact checking?

While I agree that these priest should be prosecuted to the very fullest extent of the law, if not harsher, the left attacks the church but wants our society to embrace all lifestyles, no matter how deviant they are. The Democratic Party, for example, fishes for votes by showing up to speak at conventions of pedophile organizations like NAMBLA. In addition, the Left, Hollywood, and our pedophile approving President will work to free an admitted pedophile, on the bases that he's some kind of artist.Posted By: Hair Lip Louie | July 20, 2010 at 09:00 AMReport Abuse9 AM you just made up a bunch of stuff and asserted they were facts, when they are not.Posted By: not fooled | July 20, 2010 at 09:16 AMReport AbuseEileen - there are meds that help treat that. And while many Latinos will consider themselves Catholic, most are not practicing. They accept that label but are not your devout church going types. As for breaking the law of the land, for a Christian, God's law is greater than man's law. There are numerous references to helping the alien. And if you delve into the Old Testament, God had the Israelites setting up sanctuary cities for those to flee to - those who did break the law. There are many examples in the Bible counter to your version and interpretation. What these evangelical leaders are saying is that grace and mercy is far greater than a desire to punish someone for simply wanting to live a better life. Richard Land, Gary Bauer, etc. are by no means PC, left thinking religious figures. And yes, if this were truly about the rule of law and actual justice, this crowd would be rounding up every single flag-waving patriotic American who hires illegals and profits from them as well. But I see no desire to punish the AMERICANS who are actually creating a demand, causing illegals to come here.Posted By: Red | July 20, 2010 at 09:28 AMReport AbuseSpeaking out against the sins of the church is not a matter of "right" or "left"... It's a matter of conscience and personal integrity and honesty.  Speaking out against the double-standard nonsense of power-brokers, whether they're church "fathers" or political ones is a matter of personal integrity, and has nothing to do with religion or politics.  Common sense belongs to no doctrine or political persuasion.  Since when did making sense and being honest become a matter of being right-wing or left-wing?  The American People are suffering and they're confronted with a lot of nonsense, much of it coming from the "authorities" of the church and the know-it-all politicians on the right who care more about stirring up trouble between the People than solving the nation's serious problems.Posted By: Tortoise2 | July 20, 2010 at 09:34 AMReport AbuseLets look this way, I HEARD THEY SAY IN AMERICA THEY TREAT YOU GOOD!

Such confusion makes me aware that people are so illiterate and unwilling to do a little research. As one person said, Richard Land is not the SBC president, nor did they meet behind closed doors. Southern Baptists are probably the most diverse and autonomous group of religious people in America. Go look up the word if you don't know what it means. There are democrats and republicans, conservatives and liberals among them--rich and poor, old and young, thin and fat; Black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. From the South, North, East and West. Just America. Reporters stir the pot and ignorant people throw stuff in. Just like illegals are not all ignorant criminals who live on welfare, don't care about people and have dark skin. Do a little research and you'd be surprised. This is a BIG, large problem, is what Land is saying and Christians, yes, Baptists, because that's who he represents, have an obligation to look at moral and ethical issues. This is not a 1+1=2 situation. Anyone who thinks it is is not reasonable.Posted By: Read the story | July 20, 2010 at 02:25 PMReport AbuseINCIDENTALLY, I WONDER HOW MANY SENATORS OR REPRESENTATIVES REALIZE THAT THIS WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL BORDER FENCE. THAT TWO FENCES SEPARATED BY A TRACK FOR THE US BORDER PATROL OF A HUNDRED YARDS WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED? At present I question why President Obama has deployed troops on the border, as they have no power to initiate an arrest or shoot drug smugglers? Sen. Reid should now be carefully watched, as with having a large population of illegal immigrants that will violate the law in voting him back into office. His opponent Sharron Angle can be molded by public opinion, but Reid has too many questionable irons in the fire. Many favors have likely been brought from special interests and open border trash, which need him as in top leadership to try and force through another trillion dollar amnesty. If the illegal immigration invasion was intended to be a federal violation, then why did they make entering the United States a misdemeanor, instead of a felony? IF ARIZONAS POLICING LAW IS A FEDERAL VIOLATION, WHY HASN'T THE GOVERNMENT SWEPT DOWN ON THE PROMOTERS OF SANCTUARY CITIES?
