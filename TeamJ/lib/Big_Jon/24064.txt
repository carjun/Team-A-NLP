I am the poster girl for fad diets - any crazy, crash diet that promises rapid weight loss. It doesn't matter if the claims are improbably ludicrous...and, to be truthful, most of them are. I remember the first diet ad I ever saw. It was in the back of a comic book, right next to an ad for Joe Weider Body Building (to stop the bully from kicking sand in your face) and the "sea monkey" come-along. I was never allowed to send away for the "sea monkeys", or brine shrimp, nor the guaranteed X-ray glasses, nor the tiny dog in the tea cup, but I did, eventually, sign up for any number of weight loss programs.

Childhood pictures show me to be a sweet-faced girl of average height and build - athletic, but by no means the least bit chubby. To be sure, I weighed more than my older sister, who was much taller and much slimmer than I could ever aspire to be. A distorted body image didn't help, and when I compared my compact, more muscular build to taller, more willowy classmates, I fell far short of my ideal Girls of my generation were not supposed to be muscular. We were taught that to be womanly and desirable meant to be slim. A smoothly athletic build was tolerated if one was terribly good at some sports, but sheer physical prowess and, heaven forfend, muscles were solely the domain of the males of the species. When my girls' gym class was gathered in the nurse's office for our annual weigh-in, and each girl's height and weight read into the official school records, I was embarrassed to be one of the heaviest girls in the class. I was also one of the tallest, but that was beside the point to me. That I was only two pounds heavier than my slimmer friends did nothing to assuage the mortification I felt. If memory serves, there was actually only about a four pound range between the heaviest girl in the class and the lightest. When I married and became pregnant, I gained rather too much weight, but started out to lose it quite rapidly after my son made his dramatic appearance. Then things began to go downhill, beginning with postpartum depression and ending with the dissolution of an increasingly abusive relationship. By the time I had scraped up enough courage to leave, I had ballooned to well over two hundred pounds. Stress and depression eating is as deadly a disorder as anorexia, it just takes so much longer to kill yourself that way. During the course of my marriage, as well as over the ensuing years, I have tried more diets than Baskin Robbins has flavors of ice cream.   Now, there is a great idea for a fad diet - The Baskin Robbins 137 Flavor Plan...and easy sell if I ever saw one!  I have counted calories, carbohydrates, fats, points, and glycemic indices. I have lost weight slowly, and rapidly - sometimes ounce by seemingly grudging ounce - only to gain it back almost as quickly as I lost it...and why on earth, can anyone tell me, is this process referred to as "losing" weight? I have never really lost any weight - I seem only to misplace it temporarily. One of the constants of every diet plan I have ever followed, one item it has in common with its fellows, is that it rarely lives up to its hype for any length of time. Almost any weight loss plan, even ones that rely on bizarre combinations of foods, will cause some initial loss of weight. The true efficacy of any plan can only be measured by its long-term results. Every diet plan promises rapid results.  Every diet plan promises that you can "eat what you want, and as much as you want" and still lose weight if you follow their proven method.  Every pill-pushing, potion-producing snake oil salesman from time immemorial, every fancy clinic and food replacement system has really only wanted one thing - your money. Don't gve up the ship just yet, though. There is hope out there.  Rapid Fast Weight Loss Diet - Lose 10 Pounds FastLose 10 pounds in 10 days rapidly with this fast weight loss dieting program plan. Excellent to jumpstart the metabolism to get going again after a plateau.A Common Sense System for Weight Loss | Herbal Magic | Lose Weight | Keep It OffThe Herbal Magic common sense system for weight loss is designed to help you lose weight and keep it off for good. It is a system that combines healthy eating, one-on-one personal health coaching and natural products. If you ask our clients, theyTop 10 Diet Pills Exposed  Best Weight Loss Supplement ReviewsWe've reviewed over 200 of the top selling diet pills in the world. The best diet pills based on the following 12-Point criteria are shown. In all fairness, many of these plans were begun or promoted by people who saw a need and genuinely wanted to help - at least, I would like to believe so. Some of these plans and diets that I have tried over that years have worked quite well, but some require such major or elaborate changes in your life style, or come at such an expense that they are almost impossible to maintain, to say nothing of the added difficulty of shopping for special foods. I had great initial success with the Atkins Diet Revolution, and was able to maintain those pleasant results for quite some time. The second time I went on the program, though, I lost rapidly at first and then stuck at a plateau for over six months. That, by the way is a normal happenstance with most diets, especially those where you experience fairly rapid weight loss. Some weight loss coaches and doctors now feel that is a natural effect of your body's need to balance itself before further weight loss can take place. Whatever the reason, the effect is to cause you to lose faith in the regimen, and eventually give up. Many of the plans I tried do work, however impractical or expensive they may be to stick with. A friend who was sold on one of the well-known food replacement systems managed to maintain her new weight for a number of years, but has had to stay with the quite expensive, pre-packaged products that are the mainstay of her diet plan.  Most plans like it rely on low-calorie substitutions and portion control. She still finds it difficult  dine out, because she says she hasn't really learned portion control. She is never required to measure or weigh anything. She merely prepares the pre-packaged amount. This is not to say that you will have no success with some of these plans. Even the cabbage soup diet will cause you to lose some weight.  Of course, you may be dead of palate-boredom long before you have finished the second week of that month-long plan, but overloading on vegetables is not harmful. Actually, one of the best ways to lose excess poundage is to reach for (and eat) a piece of fruit every time you feel a snack attack coming on. I don't have many pounds to shed this time around, but I will admit I have let some excess weight sneak back on over the last few years. I am now embarked on another well-known weight loss plan - the break-up diet. As I sit here surrounded by boxes and the detritus of another life, I feel no real hunger pangs. Right now I could happily exist on coffee and memories, but I know I have some whole grain cereal stashed somewhere, and a full bag of apples. Also, I am nothing if not too stubborn to give up on anything worthwhile, especially myself.  2009, Text by Elle Fredine, All rights reservedSensible Diet TipsAmazon Price: $0.99Slim-Fast 3-2-1 Plan, High Protein Shake Mix, Creamy Chocolate, 12.83oz Canisters (Pack of 3)Amazon Price: $23.24List Price: $32.97Let's Drink to your Health: A Self-Help Guide to Sensible DrinkingAmazon Price: $33.21List Price: $35.95Done With Diets: A Simple, Sensible Guide to Permanent Weight Loss and a Healthy LifestyleAmazon Price: $11.35List Price: $13.95The Eat-Clean Diet Cookbook: Great-Tasting Recipes That Keep You LeanAmazon Price: $11.46List Price: $19.95Betty Crocker The 300 Calorie Cookbook: 300 tasty meals for eating healthy every day (Betty Crocker Books)Amazon Price: $11.60List Price: $19.95The South Beach Diet Cookbook: More than 200 Delicious Recipes That Fit the Nation's Top DietAmazon Price: $9.99List Price: $26.00 Latest from RedElfBathroom Renovations: Remodeling Your Walk-through ClosetPart of any good bathroom renovation, especially in the case of awalk-through closet and ensuite combination, will include renovating yourwalk-through closet.

I ended up thinner, but actually gained a pound.  But my energy and strength are greatly increased.  Anyway, I hope this is helpfulRedElf16 months ago Thanks so much, Jess. You trimmed down and added lean muscle mass, which weighs more than fat. Good for you. I don't think I could manage a grueling training schedule right now, but your diet looks fine - thanks.Natalie Marie16 months ago This is great.  It always amazes me how many different fads and trends in dieting and weight loss come and go, and some even stick around (how long has the cabbage soup diet been around?!).  I used to yo-yo a little bit, only fluctuating by as much as 10 pounds I would guess, and I finally realized that what works for me is no real diet.  Everything in moderation helps me, and I feel that if I am not worried or stressed or feeling guilty about what I am eating, I tend to make healthier choices anyway.  On top of that, I am a vegetarian, so I have to plan well-balanced meals to make sure I'm getting everything I need.  Great article!  Although I'm sorry to hear about the breakup diet :(RedElf16 months ago Thanks so much Natalie Marie - the break-up diet is no fun, ;)It takes quite a commitment to be a vegetarian. Good for you. I certainly agree about all things in moderation, and I am glad you are able to make healthier choices. thanks so much for your thoughtful comments.Kyon, thanks so much for stopping by to comment.michelle.dragon9916 months ago cool hub:)congratulations!hamghw16 months ago niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeRedElf16 months ago madishan, thanks so much for stopping by and I appreciate your comment, but can't post the link here ;)Thanks for commenting michelle - nice to meet you!hamghw and chat, thanks also for the commentsMikeNV16 months ago People have trouble losing weight because they eat what they like the taste of and are unwilling to change life long habits.  If you learn "how to" eat for the nutrition your body needs, then get yourself away from the foods that made you overweight you'll be able to keep the weight off.  Avoid the inner rows at the Grocery Store. Shop the periphery where all the real food items are located. Real unprocessed foods will give your body what it wants.The battle is more mental than physical.  You learn to eat to live, not live to eat.RedElf16 months ago Right you are, Mike, and thanks for sharing such great advice! ...and you are SO right about the battle being more mental than physical. Thanks so much for your comments.Tiara designs16 months ago I have never been obese but I have always kept in mind portion size. Last year 4 the first time in my life I gained over 15 lbs and I couldn't take it off with a crash diet. It took going on a temp veggie diet, drinking 1 slim fast a day and riding my bike now I am at a better weight. before this I really didn't understand - weight problems but now I have deep sympathy and while it may seem like only a few lbs- it took me 7-8 months of trying everything - and nothing worked- it was really frustrating. I also started taking resvertrol- I wrote a hub about it if you're interested.this is a nice article thanks 4 sharing...greegel16 months ago nice hubthank youRedElf16 months ago Welcome, Tiara designs. Fifteen pounds can be an awful lot of weight to the person trying to lose it! Sounds like a pretty strict regimen, but you came out all right though, and I am very glad for you.

I've been wanting to write one in regards to my own struggles with weight but haven't gotten around to it. Now that I'm off the breastfeeding diet it's been hard to lose the baby weight. I'm still around the weight I started at before I got prego the first time but according to the weight charts (and the cushion around my middle) I'm still 15 to 20 pounds over the weight range for my height. I've was doing great from August last year up until I got sick in January. I'd lost 20 pounds total but now I've gained 9 of it back and have been stressing and depressing over it. To top it off I recently self-diagnosed myself as an emotional eater, plus I'm an avid baker working on opening a bakery so that doesn't help but I'm trying.Thanks for the article.RedElf16 months ago You are most welcome, maryleo9. Knowing what your triggers are really helps - it isn't a cure and it doesn't make them go away, but at least you are aware of what might set you off.Try noticing them, and when they happen. Then, when you are more aware, you can, with practice, redirect the feelings more appropriately.Stressing about it doesn't help though. The best antidote to depression is physical exercise. If you can take baby for a walk, even around the block to start, that would really help you.Best of luck to you with the bakery!Charmaine Lim16 months ago Thanks for sharing. Frankly,I do not like to deprive myself of food especially my favorite food. I eat moderately and I make sure that I workout regularly to stay fit.RedElf16 months ago I am so glad that works for you!

I really appreciate your comments.hardBODmiranda14 months ago I do not think we need to chose between being healthy and not eating. I do not agree that you will need to give up food that you love to eat. The key here is to eat in moderation, Christopher Guerriero once told me that I need to eat low fat longevity foods like salmonalmonds, red grapes, blueberries, garlic, spinach and whole grains.RedElf14 months ago Greetings, hardBodmiranda!

Anyway I have included your comments here without your link and good luck bloggingMatthew Gannon  says:10 hours agoGreat hub, ill let my friends know about it!Coach Albert13 months ago Hi Redelf,Love your moniker by the way...First off, great hub, witty and informative.That being said, I HATE diets!!! Please let me explain, as a certified personal trainer, I hear non-stop from clients and friends contemplating every fad diet, juice fast, detox cleanse, and even surgical procedures. I recommend none of the above!I'm always having to pick up the pieces when my clients are determined to do them and then fail.The *worst* one was the Atkins diet. I had a 300lb client who I managed to get down to 235, unsatisfied with that progress, he was determined to try the Atkins diet, put himself into khetosis and made himself sick, and then gained all the weight back before coming back to train with me again.I do encourage you to pick up the book, "In Defense of Food" by Michael Pollan. And no I am in no way affiliated with him, although probably should be. He has a very simple mantra, ***Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants*** In addition I would add to try and make them locally grown and organic and avoid animal fats and sugar.After that, it's a matter of increasing your activity level. Humans weren't meant to sit for eight to sixteen hours a day. However, that is exactly what the majority of the American populace tends to do. Eight hours of work followed by another four to eight hours of TV.It's as simple as that.  If you work at an office, behind a desk, it is vital to get up and about every hour and walk around.  Making changes like riding a bike to work instead of driving, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator every day, or going for a thirty minute walk on your lunch break every day, can make a huge change in how you see your waistline.Any way I'm not trying to come off as combative, It's just that as i finished your article i was waiting to hear you come to the realization that eating right and exercising is the only way and was disappointed to see you hadn't. Diets don't work, and exercise alone is a very slow process, for results in a shorter amount of time, (Notice I didn't say "quick" or "rapid") an appropriate eating strategy married with more exercise, is what you and everyone else, really needs.Wow, I wrote a whole hub on your hub. Thanks for the inspiration. ;-)Cheers,-Coach AlbertRedElf13 months ago My dear - you have indeed written a whole hub in this comment! I expect to get a credit for inspiration when you do publish. :D Thanks so much for your kind words and for your sage advice - you are, however, preaching to the choir ;)netrageouz13 months ago thank you for your post and your tips, i love you comment..."losing" weight? I have never really lost any weight - I seem only to misplace it temporarily." So many patients share this same pain in their dilemma at weight loss. I do well by checking the metabolism (thyroid, etc), screen for sfood sensitivities with the ALCAT test, correct what I find and then offer the hCG weight loss method to my more devoted patients with discipline, and many many pounds to lose.

Person12 months ago I have a very serious problem and was wondering if you thought doing what you suggested in your hub would help. I am a 15 year old pre-professional ballernia who is overweight- 25 pounds overweight. Last week my instructor told me I must lose weight. I have a 40 inch waist. That is a lot for a ballernia. Thw weight has been off and on for about a year and I really need help. If you have any suggestions, please tell them to me. If not, that is fine. Thank you in advance.   P.S. Most of my weight is around my belly.RedElf12 months ago Thanks, Katherine, I have included your comments without your links:Katherine  says:9 days agoHello, I'm searching for diet related blogs like mine and I stumbled your site, nice blog!. I hope you could also include me in your blogroll.By the way, you have a very good writing skills here. Keep up the good work.? Person, I think you need to look at the reasons you are having trouble keeping the weight off. I also think you need to look at what your weight should be given your age,  height and muscle mass. Cross-training, such as power walking or running, can be helpful, as well as a diet with lots of fresh vegetables and fruit. To keep weight off successfully, you need to make healthy eating choices, and watch your quantities. Check with your doctor first, and good luck in your career.?

I used to drink about 2 cans of soda a day, and I have totally cut soda out of my diet. Changing my eating habits has definitely made a difference in my appearance and energy level!RedElf8 months ago That's great, Weigh-less!
