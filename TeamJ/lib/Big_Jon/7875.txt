Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWikipedia:Biographies of living personsFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia(Redirected from Wikipedia:LIVING)Jump to: navigation,searchThis page documents an English Wikipedia policy, a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Changes made to it should reflect consensus.Shortcut:WP:BLPThis page in a nutshell: Material about living persons must be written with the greatest care and attention to verifiability, neutrality, and avoiding original research.If you are concerned about the accuracy or appropriateness of biographical material on Wikipedia, report problems at the biographies of living persons noticeboard. For articles about yourself, please see "Dealing with articles about yourself" below.For how to complain to the Wikimedia Foundation, see here and below.Editors must take particular care when adding information about living persons to any Wikipedia page.[1] Such material requires a high degree of sensitivity, and must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States, to this policy, and to Wikipedia's three core content policies:Neutral point of view (NPOV)Verifiability (V)No original research (NOR)We must get the article right. Be very firm about the use of high quality sources. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation. Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourcedwhether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionableshould be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.[2] Users who constantly or egregiously violate this policy may be blocked from editing.Biographies of living persons (BLPs) must be written conservatively and with regard for the subject's privacy. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a tabloid: it is not Wikipedia's job to be sensationalist, or to be the primary vehicle for the spread of titillating claims about people's lives, and the possibility of harm to living subjects must always be considered when exercising editorial judgment. This policy applies to BLPs, including any living person mentioned in a BLP even if not the subject of the article, and to material about living persons on other pages.[3] The burden of evidence for any edit on Wikipedia rests with the person who adds or restores material.Contents1 Writing style1.1 Tone1.2 Criticism and praise1.3 Attack pages2 Reliable sources2.1 Challenged or likely to be challenged2.2 Remove unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material2.3 Avoid gossip and feedback loops2.4 Misuse of primary sources2.5 Avoid self-published sources2.5.1 Using the subject as a self-published source2.6 Further reading and external links3 Presumption in favor of privacy3.1 Avoid victimization3.2 Public figures3.3 Privacy of personal information and using primary sources3.4 People who are relatively unknown3.5 Subjects notable only for one event3.6 Privacy of names3.7 Restraining orders4 Where BLP does and does not apply4.1 Non-article space4.2 Images4.3 Categories, lists and navigation templates4.4 Deceased4.5 Legal persons and groups5 Maintenance of BLPs5.1 Importance of maintenance5.2 Semi-protection, protection, and blocking5.3 Templates5.4 Deletion5.4.1 Summary deletion, salting, and courtesy blanking5.4.2 Restoring deleted content5.4.3 Proposed deletion of biographies of living people6 Relationship between the subject, the article, and Wikipedia6.1 Dealing with edits by the subject of the article6.2 Dealing with articles about yourself6.3 Wikimedia Foundation resolution6.4 How to complain to the Wikimedia Foundation7 See also8 Notes9 Further readingWriting stylePolicy shortcut:WP:BLPSTYLEToneBLPs should be written responsibly, cautiously, and in a dispassionate tone, avoiding both understatement and overstatement. Articles should document in a non-partisan manner what reliable secondary sources have published about the subject, and in some circumstances what the subject has published about himself. BLPs should not have trivia sections.Criticism and praiseCriticism and praise should be included if they can be sourced to reliable secondary sources, so long as the material is presented responsibly, conservatively, and in a disinterested tone. Do not give disproportionate space to particular viewpoints; the views of tiny minorities should not be included at all. Care must be taken with article structure to ensure the overall presentation and section headings are broadly neutral. Beware of claims that rely on guilt by association, and look out for biased or malicious content.Attack pagesFurther information: Wikipedia:Attack pagesandWikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G10Pages that are unsourced and negative in tone, especially when they appear to have been created to disparage the subject, should be deleted at once if there is no policy-compliant version to revert to; see below. Non-administrators should tag them {{db-attack}}.Reliable sourcesThe Five PillarsContent policiesArticle titlesBiographies of living personsNeutral point of viewNo original researchVerifiabilityWhat Wikipedia is notChallenged or likely to be challengedMain page: WP:SOURCESWikipedia's sourcing policy, Verifiability, says that all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation; material not complying with this may be removed. This policy extends that principle, adding that contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced should be removed immediately and without discussion. This applies whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable, and whether it is in a biography or in some other article.Remove unsourced or poorly sourced contentious materialSee also: Wikipedia:LibelPolicy shortcut:WP:GRAPEVINERemove immediately any contentious material about a living person that is unsourced or poorly sourced; that is a conjectural interpretation of a source (see No original research); that relies on self-published sources, unless written by the subject of the BLP (see below); or that relies on sources that fail in some other way to comply with Verifiability. Note: although the three-revert rule does not apply to such removals, what counts as exempt under BLP can be controversial. Editors who find themselves in edit wars over potentially defamatory material about living persons should consider raising the matter at the BLP noticeboard instead of relying on the exemption.Administrators may enforce the removal of clear BLP violations with page protection or by blocking the violator(s), even if they have been editing the article themselves or are in some other way involved. In less clear cases they should request the attention of an uninvolved administrator at Wikipedia:Administrators Noticeboard/Incidents.Avoid gossip and feedback loopsPolicy shortcut:WP:BLPGOSSIPAvoid repeating gossip. Ask yourself whether the source is reliable; whether the material is being presented as true; and whether, even if true, it is relevant to a disinterested article about the subject. Be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. Also beware of feedback loops, in which material in a Wikipedia article gets picked up by a source, which is later cited in the Wikipedia article to support the original edit.Misuse of primary sourcesMain page: WP:PRIMARYShortcut:WP:BLPPRIMARYExercise caution in using primary sources. Do not use trial transcripts and other court records, or other public documents, to support assertions about a living person. Do not use public records that include personal details, such as date of birth, home value, traffic citations, vehicle registrations, and home or business addresses. Where primary-source material has been discussed by a reliable secondary source, it may be acceptable to rely on it to augment the secondary source, subject to the restrictions of this policy, no original research, and the other sourcing policies.Avoid self-published sourcesShortcut:WP:BLPSPSNever use self-published sourcesincluding but not limited to books, zines, websites, blogs, and tweetsas sources of material about a living person, unless written or published by the subject (see below). "Self-published blogs" in this context refers to personal and group blogs. Some news organizations host online columns that they call blogs, and these may be acceptable as sources so long as the writers are professionals and the blog is subject to the newspaper's full editorial control. Posts left by readers are never acceptable as sources.[4] See below for our policy on self-published images.Using the subject as a self-published sourceFurther information: WP:SELFPUBLiving persons may publish material about themselves, such as through press releases or personal websites. Such material may be used as a source only ifit is not unduly self-serving;it does not involve claims about third parties;it does not involve claims about events not directly related to the subject;there is no reasonable doubt as to its authenticity;the article is not based primarily on such sources.These provisions do not apply to autobiographies published by reliable third-party publishing houses, because they are not self-published.Further reading and external linksExternal links about living persons, whether in BLPs or elsewhere, are held to a higher standard than for other topics. Questionable or self-published sources should not be included in the "Further reading" or "External links" sections of BLPs, and when including such links in other articles make sure the material linked to does not violate this policy. Self-published sources written or published by the subject of a BLP may be included in the FR or EL sections of that BLP with caution; see above. In general, do not link to websites that contradict the spirit of this policy or violate the External links guideline. Where that guideline is inconsistent with this or any other policy, the policies prevail.Presumption in favor of privacyAvoid victimizationWhen writing about a person notable only for one or two events, including every detail can lead to problems, even when the material is well-sourced. When in doubt, biographies should be pared back to a version that is completely sourced, neutral, and on-topic. This is of particular importance when dealing with individuals whose notability stems largely or entirely from being victims of another's actions. Wikipedia editors must not act, intentionally or otherwise, in a way that amounts to participating in or prolonging the victimization.Public figuresPolicy shortcut:WP:WELLKNOWNIn the case of public figures, there will be a multitude of reliable published sources, and BLPs should simply document what these sources say. If an allegation or incident is notable, relevant, and well-documented, it belongs in the articleeven if it is negative and the subject dislikes all mention of it. If it is not documented by reliable third-party sources, leave it out.Example: "John Doe had a messy divorce from Jane Doe." Is this important to the article, and was it published by third-party reliable sources? If not, leave it out, or stick to the facts: "John Doe divorced Jane Doe."Example: A politician is alleged to have had an affair. He or she denies it, but The New York Times publishes the allegations, and there is a public scandal. The allegation belongs in the biography, citing The New York Times as the source.Privacy of personal information and using primary sourcesShortcut:WP:DOBWith identity theft on the rise, people increasingly regard their full names and dates of birth as private. Wikipedia includes full names and dates of birth where these have been widely published by reliable sources, or by sources linked to the subject such that it may reasonably be inferred that the subject does not object. Where the subject complains about the inclusion of the date of birth, or where the person is borderline notable, err on the side of caution and simply list the year. In a similar vein, articles should not include postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, or other contact information for living persons, though links to websites maintained by the subject are generally permitted. See above regarding the misuse of primary sources to obtain personal information about subjects.People who are relatively unknownPolicy shortcut:WP:NPFWikipedia contains biographical material on people who, while notable enough for an entry, are not generally well known. In such cases, exercise restraint and include only material relevant to their notability, focusing on high quality secondary sources. Material published by the subject may be used, but with caution; see above. Material that may adversely affect a person's reputation should be treated with special care; in many jurisdictions, repeating a defamatory claim is actionable, and there is additional protection for subjects who are not public figures.Subjects notable only for one eventPolicy shortcut:WP:BLP1EFurther information: Wikipedia:Notability (people)#People notable for only one eventWikipedia is not news, or an indiscriminate collection of information. Merely being in the news does not imply someone should be the subject of a Wikipedia article. If reliable sources cover the person only in the context of a single event, and if that person otherwise remains, or is likely to remain, a low-profile individual, we should generally avoid having an article on them. Biographies in these cases can give undue weight to the event and conflict with neutral point of view. In such cases, it is usually better to merge the information and redirect the person's name to the event article. If the event is significant and the individual's role within it is substantial, a separate biography may be appropriate. Individuals notable for well-documented events, such as John Hinckley, Jr., fit into this category. The significance of an event or individual should be indicated by how persistent the coverage is in reliable sources.[5]Privacy of namesShortcut:WP:BLPNAMECaution should be applied when identifying individuals who are discussed primarily in terms of a single event. When the name of a private individual has not been widely disseminated or has been intentionally concealed, such as in certain court cases or occupations, it is often preferable to omit it, especially when doing so does not result in a significant loss of context. When deciding whether to include a name, its publication in secondary sources other than news media, such as scholarly journals or the work of recognized experts, should be afforded greater weight than the brief appearance of names in news stories. Consider whether the inclusion of names of private living individuals who are not directly involved in an article's topic adds significant value. The presumption in favor of privacy is strong in the case of family members of articles' subjects and other loosely involved, otherwise low-profile persons.The names of any immediate, ex, or significant family members or any significant relationship of the subject of a BLP may be part of an article, if reliably sourced, subject to editorial discretion that such information is relevant to a reader's complete understanding of the subject.Restraining ordersSubjects who have restraining orders may need to make special requests, which should be handled through the OTRS system.Where BLP does and does not applyBLP applies to all material about living persons anywhere on Wikipedia, including talk pages, edit summaries, user pages, images, and categories. It does not apply to the deceased or to corporations, but see below for advice regarding those areas.Non-article spacePolicy shortcut:WP:BLPTALKContentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced and not related to making content choices, should be removed, deleted, or oversighted as appropriate. When seeking advice about whether to publish something about a living person, be careful not to post so much information on the talk page that the inquiry becomes moot. The same principle applies to problematic images. Questionable claims already discussed can be removed with a reference to the previous discussion.The BLP policy also applies to user and user talk pages. The single exception is that users may make any claim they wish about themselves in their user space, so long as they are not engaged in impersonation, and subject to What Wikipedia is not, though minors are discouraged from disclosing identifying personal information on their userpages; for more information, see here.[6] Although this policy applies to posts about Wikipedians in project space, some leeway is permitted to allow the handling of administrative issues by the community, but administrators may delete such material if it rises to the level of defamation, or if it constitutes a violation of No personal attacks.ImagesFurther information: Wikipedia:No original research#Original_imagesPolicy shortcut:WP:MUGImages of living persons should not be used out of context to present a person in a false or disparaging light. This is particularly important for police booking photographs (mugshots), or situations where the subject was not expecting to be photographed. Images of living persons that have been generated by Wikipedians and others may be used if they have been released under a copyright licence that is compatible with Wikipedia:Image use policy.Categories, lists and navigation templatesPolicy shortcut:WP:BLPCATSee also: Wikipedia:Categorization of people, Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates,and Wikipedia:Categorization/Ethnicity, gender, religion and sexualityCategory names do not carry disclaimers or modifiers, so the case for each category must be made clear by the article text and its reliable sources. Categories regarding religious beliefs and sexual orientation should not be used unless the subject has publicly self-identified with the belief or orientation in question; and the subject's beliefs or sexual orientation are relevant to their notable activities or public life, according to reliable published sources. Caution should be used with categories that suggest a person has a poor reputation (see false light). For example, Category:Criminals and its subcategories should only be added for an incident that is relevant to the person's notability; the incident was published by reliable third-party sources; the subject was convicted; and the conviction was not overturned on appeal. These principles apply equally to infobox statements, and to lists and navigation templates that are based on religious beliefs and sexual orientation, or which suggest that the persons included in the list or template have a poor reputation.DeceasedPolicy shortcut:WP:BDPThis policy does not apply to edits about the dead. But material about dead people may have implications for their living relatives and friends, particularly in the case of recent deaths, so anything questionable should be removed promptly. Any individual born less than 115 years ago is covered by this policy unless a reliable source has confirmed the individual's death. People over 115 years old are presumed dead unless listed at oldest people.Legal persons and groupsPolicy shortcut:WP:BLPGROUPThis policy does not normally apply to edits about corporations, companies, or other entities regarded as legal persons, though any such material must comply with the other content policies. The extent to which the BLP policy applies to edits about groups is complex and must be judged on a case-by-case basis. A harmful statement about a small group or organization comes closer to being a BLP problem than a similar statement about a larger group; and when the group is very small, it may be impossible to draw a distinction between the group and the individuals that make up the group. When in doubt, make sure you are using high-quality sources.Maintenance of BLPsImportance of maintenanceReport BLP incidents at the biographies of living persons noticeboard.Wikipedia contains hundreds of thousands of articles about living persons. From both a legal and ethical standpoint it is essential that a determined effort be made to eliminate defamatory and other inappropriate material from these articles, but these concerns must be balanced against other concerns, such as allowing articles to show a bias in the subject's favor by removing appropriate material simply because the subject objects to it, or allowing articles about non-notable publicity-seekers to be retained. When in doubt about whether material in a BLP is appropriate, the article should be pared back to a policy-compliant version. Sometimes the use of administrative tools such as page protection and deletion is necessary for the enforcement of this policy, and in extreme cases action by Wikimedia Foundation staff is required.Semi-protection, protection, and blockingAdministrators who suspect malicious or biased editing, or believe that non-compliant material may be added or restored, may protect or semi-protect pages in accordance with the protection policy. Editors who repeatedly add or restore contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced may be blocked for disruption; see the blocking policy.Templates{{BLP}} alerting readers to this policy may be added to the talk pages of BLPs and other articles that focus on living persons. {{Blpo}} is suitable for articles containing material on the deceased that also contains material about living persons. If a {{WPBiography}} template is present, you can add |living=yes to the template parameters. If a {{WikiProjectBannerShell}} template is also present, add |blp=yes to it. {{BLP dispute}} may be used on BLPs needing attention; {{BLP sources}} on BLPs needing better sourcing; and {{BLP unsourced}} for those with no sources at all. For editors violating this policy, the following can be used to warn them on their talk pages:{{uw-biog1}}{{uw-biog2}} or {{blp0}}{{uw-biog3}} or {{blp1}}{{uw-biog4}} or {{blp2}}{{blp3}} for when a block is issuedThe template {{BLP removal}} can be used on a talk page of an article (or a user) to explain why material has been removed under this policy, and under what conditions the material may be replaced.DeletionPolicy shortcuts:WP:BLPDELWP:BLPDELETESummary deletion, salting, and courtesy blankingFurther information: Wikipedia:Deletion policyBiographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed. If the entire page is substantially of poor quality, primarily containing contentious material that is unsourced or poorly sourced, then it may be necessary to delete the entire page as an initial step, followed by discussion.Page deletion is normally a last resort. If a dispute centers around a page's inclusion (e.g., because of questionable notability or where the subject has requested deletion), this is addressed via deletion discussions rather than by summary deletion. Summary deletion is appropriate when the page contains unsourced negative material or is written non-neutrally, and when this cannot readily be rewritten or restored to an earlier version of an acceptable standard. The deleting administrator should be prepared to explain the action to others, by e-mail if the material is sensitive. Those who object to the deletion should bear in mind that the deleting admin may be aware of issues that others are not. Disputes may be taken to deletion review, but protracted public discussion should be avoided for deletions involving sensitive personal material about living persons, particularly if it is negative. Such debates may be courtesy blanked upon conclusion. After the deletion, any administrator may choose to protect it against recreation.Restoring deleted contentTo ensure that material about living people is always policy-compliant (written neutrally to a high standard, and based on high-quality reliable sources) the burden of proof is on those who wish to retain, restore, or undelete the disputed material. When material about living persons has been deleted on good-faith BLP objections, any editor wishing to add, restore, or undelete it must ensure it complies with Wikipedia's content policies. If it is to be restored without significant change, consensus must be obtained first, and wherever possible disputed deletions should be discussed first with the administrator who deleted the article. Material that has been repaired to address concerns should be judged on a case-by-case basis.Proposed deletion of biographies of living peopleFurther information: Wikipedia:Proposed deletion of biographies of living peopleAs of April 3, 2010, a new proposed deletion process was established, requiring all BLPs created after March 18, 2010 to have at least one source that supports at least one statement made about the person in the article, or it can be proposed for deletion. This is known as a BLPPROD. The tag may not be removed until a reliable source is provided, and if none is forthcoming the article may be deleted after ten days. This does not affect the other deletion processes mentioned in the BLP policy and elsewhere.Relationship between the subject, the article, and Wikipedia"For those who either have or might have an article about themselves it is a temptation, especially if plainly wrong, or strongly negative information is included, to become involved in questions regarding their own article. This can open the door to rather immature behavior and loss of dignity. It is a violation of don't bite the newbies to strongly criticize users who fall into this trap rather than seeing this phenomenon as a newbie mistake." Arbitration Committee, December 18, 2005[7]Dealing with edits by the subject of the articleShortcut:WP:BLPEDITSubjects sometimes become involved in editing material about themselves, either directly or through a representative. The Arbitration Committee has ruled in favor of showing leniency to BLP subjects who try to fix what they see as errors or unfair material. Although Wikipedia discourages people from writing about themselves, removal of unsourced or poorly sourced material is acceptable. When an anonymous editor blanks all or part of a BLP, this might be the subject attempting to remove problematic material. Edits like this by subjects should not be treated as vandalism; instead, the subject should be invited to explain their concerns.Dealing with articles about yourselfShortcuts:WP:BIOSELFWP:BLPSELFWP:BLPCOMPLAINWP:BLPCOMPLAINTSee also: Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/HelpWikipedia has editorial policies that will often help to resolve your concern, many users willing to help, and a wide range of escalation processes. Very obvious errors can be fixed quickly, including by yourself. But beyond that, post suggestions on the article talk page, or place {{adminhelp}} on your talk page. If you have reason to complain, please bear in mind that Wikipedia is almost entirely operated by volunteers, and impolite behavior, even if entirely understandable, will often be less effective. See below for how to contact the Wikimedia Foundation.Wikimedia Foundation resolutionContact usFurther information: Foundation:Resolution:Biographies of living peopleOn April 9, 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees passed a resolution regarding Wikimedia's handling of material about living persons. It noted that there are problems with some BLPs being overly promotional in tone, being vandalized, and containing errors and smears. The Foundation urges that special attention be paid to neutrality and verifiability regarding living persons; that human dignity and personal privacy be taken into account, especially in articles of ephemeral or marginal interest; that new technical mechanisms be investigated for assessing edits that affect living people; and that anyone who has a complaint about how they are described on the project's websites be treated with patience, kindness, and respect.How to complain to the Wikimedia FoundationIf you are not satisfied with the response of editors and admins to a concern about biographical material about living persons, you can ask the Foundation's team of volunteers for help.
