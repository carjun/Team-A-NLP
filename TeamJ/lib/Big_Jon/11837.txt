It was overwhelmingly an Anglo renters community, yet it suffered from a disdain held by the power structure and more establishment types.Hundreds if not thousands of young people congregated on OBs beaches and streets, often shunned by Newport Avenue businesses, while been soaked by landlords asking exorbitant rents for cottages and, at times, nothing more than beach shacks, and suffering from an inordinate amount of police harassment. Very few businesses catered to the young. The Black  a head shop, had opened on Newport, and there was the Inbetween  a drop-in center on Newport  but there were no coffee houses, no organic veggie stores or restaurants, no juice bars, no music or dance clubs, and many of the bars that existed catered to an older crowd. Unlike the current downtown OB scene any evening of the week, there was virtually no night-life on Newport Avenue. It wasnt easy being a hippie in those early times. (For more, see below.)The OB Peoples Rag, Vol. 1, No. 7Click on image to see entire issueWhen the Rag appeared, it was a time of social and political upheaval nation-wide as well as locally. Thousands of college and university campuses had just been in turmoil that Spring due to President Nixons expansion of the Vietnam war. African-American communities smoldered following decades of official neglect and police repression. Chicano and Mexican-American neighborhoods were undergoing an awakening and shaking off cultural shackles. On the gender front, militant feminists and middle-class housewives were building a movement that pressed for equality for women at all levels in society. Social unrest was in the air, at least for the young.[For a further accounting of these trends and history, see "The Early Politics" on the Page side bar to the right.]The Persecution of the HippiesIt is perhaps difficult to understand what it was like to be a hippie, forty years after their initial appearance on the American cultural and political landscape. The hippies, the peaceful warriors of the counter-culture were seen as a threat to the mainstream culture and its values. The system  the establishment  reacted very negatively when young men and women in massive numbers discovered and asserted themselves in the new hip ways, with dress, hairstyles, and language. A whole array of institutional forces slammed down on the hipsters, from police harassment, to landlord abuse, institutional and bureaucratic blocks, and business prejudice. It was cultural suppression. A cultural war.This war of the cultures was played out in places like Ocean Beach, where hippies lived. After the 1968 wide-spread flowering of the hip generation, housing inspectors swept through the beach community, citing landlords for poor housing conditions. But the effect was to have condemnation proceedings used to rid OB of its worst slums  knocking out housing that hippies and young people could afford.Many straight businesses showed their prejudice against the hippies unabashedly. Long-hair on men was abhorrent, they had to be dirty. Hippie women were loose and promiscuous. Officialdom in Ocean Beach shunned the hippies. Newport merchants eyed them with a deep, animal-like suspicion whenever a young person perceived as a hippie entered their store. It was likely the merchants who pressured city officials and the police to do something about these hippies.Police vs. HippiesPolice harassment of hippies  whether in OB or across the country  has been well documented. It was even a sociological issue, and Gormlie had studied this cultural war and prejudice against hippies, having written a major college paper on the subject. The Rag would later expound on the issue of police harassment, with numerous accounts of OB locals, as it was a prevalent issue among the young; the town council and a human rights organization even later would begin campaigning against the police. But in mid-1971 activists opened up a legal office to give counseling about police abuse and organizers handed out police complaint forms. At the time, it was a standard practice of police officers to stop whomever they wished and run a Field Interrogation on them. This was used constantly on young hippies. During the Summer of 1969, it was literally difficult for a young, hippie male to drive or walk across the community at night without being stopped by a cop.The prevalence of the hippie  youth tension with cops was clearly evident in the results of the Spring 1971 OB Study of a White Youth Ghetto (see New Blood). The survey, home interviews of 741 residents of north-west OB, found a generally negative view of San Diego Police.  40% of those contacted considered police harassment to be one of the most disagreeable factors in living in OB. 71% of those between the ages of 15  18 expressed this view. More than one out of every three people interviewed had experienced some form of adverse contact with the police in OB. Nearly 40% of the 15 to 18 year group reported being field interrogated themselves. Finally, approximately 56% interviewed favored community control of the police.This tension between the communitys youth and the local gendarmes, clearly obvious in outbursts such as the Easter Riots (1968), the Jetty battle (1970), and the Collier Park Riot (1971), would fester unti action was taken by the local town council in conjunction with activists who collaborated on efforts to curtail outrageous police conduct. The San Diego Police Department, under then Chief Ray Hoobler, enacted a confrontationist policy when dealing with rowdy youth. It was arrest them first, ask questions never. No negotiations with hippies. Only strong-arm tactics work.It wouldnt be until the mid-seventies that community pressure forced the police to reform some of their procedures. (However, issues about the police never seemed to go away. In 2003, the Ocean Beach Grassroots Organization  OBGO  led 500 people in a rally and march against police brutality, after officers had unjustifiably shot and killed a homeless man in front of dozens of residents.)Persecuted by the institutions, the police, landlords, hippies were under siege but bursting out all over everywhere all at the same time. They couldnt be stopped. And hippies congregated with other hippies, especially in Ocean Beach.The Revolution Will Not Be TelevisedAs Frank Gormlies college career came to a close in the Spring of 1970, he and his spouse, Susan, planned to move back to Ocean Beach from UCSD. Gormlie felt very strongly that he had to continue to be involved the anti-war movement  as he had been at UCSD  but also be involved in something greater, some higher social impulse and mandate. He believed some kind of revolution would eventually engulf and change America for the better. He wanted to be part of it  to be part of what he perceived to be his generations historic role: the transformation of America into more of a truly free and democratic society. The best way to do that, he believed, was to start from the ground up, on the community level, to build a beachhead of progressive politics and revolutionary life styles. He didnt have it all worked out in his head, but the time was ripe, he felt, to do community organizing, and to do community organizing with some sort of journalistic vehicle.Limitations of the College Campus Yield to Community OrganizingHaving directly experienced the limitations of the college campus, he had come to believe that if change was going to occur in American society, it had to happen on the community level. He understood generally the traditional left emphasis on workplace organizing, but he also had experienced first hand the cutting-edge political role that young people, especially young people within the counter-culture could and were playing. The campuses, of course, were very important, but they had their problems: the in-grown transiency, their un-real nature  the Ivory Tower thing the disconnect between the campus and the on-going real life of societys citizens, their ultimate un-democratic nature where a governor could simply step in and with the whip of a pen, shut them down, throwing thousands of students out onto the streets overnight.Yet, apart and connected to many college campuses, were the communities that often surrounded the campuses, communities full of students, their friends and families, other young people, the people who served them  these were the small college towns, like Isla Vista  next to UC Santa Barbara, like Madison, Wisconsin, like Ann Arbor, Michigan, like Lawrence, Kansas, like Amherst, like Berkeley. These neighborhoods, more permanent than the shifting tides on campus, had become the testing grounds of the new politics, the new left politics that were meshing with the counter-culture, the hippie movement. Politics was personal, and the personal was political. These college-centered communities then became the incubators for not only a new politics, but a new way of life.Share|Pages: 1 2 3 { 24 comments read them below or add one }Evonne SchulzeNovember 2, 2007 at 11:14 pmImagine my surprise when i ran into Genie Phllips and she told me the Ob Rag was back and Frank was still in there plugging!!!!!I wish you great success and I am going to spread the word to some of the oldies that are still around.  This is great.  Maybe we can even get a few stories about what once was and that nothing has truly changed, etc.I will stay in touch.cheers, evonneReplyNancy 22November 25, 2007 at 3:02 amThanks for the site.This oldie wants to say.I do recall the old days.The beaches were actually clean.2000 the last time I visited with the grandchildren I told them there used to be abalone in the tide pools under the pier before their dad was born. Another war and a generation later the Ocean Beach Rag is sill alive and so is Hope.The Rag and the folks that worked on the paper ment Hope and struggle to show that there is something else an alternitave to repression. Would some one else share what the Rag ment to them? ThanksKeep on Keeping OnLittleReplyClark DeLeonDecember 10, 2007 at 12:07 pmCongratulations on the OB CyberRag.  I worked on an underground/alternative weekly in Philadelphia called The Drummer in the early 1970s and also the daily student newspaper at Temple University.  This prepared me for the day when I would become a columnist at The Philadelphia Inquirer, which I was for more than 20 years. I currently write a column for the Philadelphia Metro.  I give this as background just to show you that Ive been there, done that.  Which is why I appreciated the story of the origin of the OB People Rag.  My sister and brother-in-law, Denise and Stuart Seymour, have lived in OB for almost two decades.  My family gets to visit for a week almost every summer, and I love the OB vibe.  Weve got a section of Philadelphia called South Street, which is like Newport Avenue  with the Delaware River at the end instead of the Pacific Ocean. South street was the result of the same kind of political and community awakening that took place in OB during the late 60s and early 70s.  I can report that your east coast hippie cousins are still rocking the establishment, establishing justice, working with rather than against the environment, living large and taking responsibility for their communities.   The activists of old have become the parents and grandparents of today.  And they havent sold out (not all of them, anyway).  It was a great time to come of age and I still see its spirit alive and well in the biker bars and coffee houses, in the Chop Shop art gallery and on the sideways of Ocean Beach.Clark DeLeonReplyzarielDecember 28, 2009 at 6:38 pmOnly in OB could a mix like this have happened. Does anyone remember the original OB peoples food store located in the small [bike?] shop before it moved up the street into a rebuilt pool hall? The OB free school? Hallelujah michael? Eru, Skyhorse Largo or any number of rare and unforgettable characters that lent this funky beach town its quite original vibe that gave this Philly boy a mental makeover thats lasted a lifetime. Good to see you still groovinReplyFrank GormlieDecember 28, 2009 at 6:42 pmZariel  check out our series on OB Peoples Food Co-op  which includes a photo of the old store front.ReplyMarjorie Ann DrakeMarch 19, 2008 at 3:52 pmWowie, I guess were getting old, hmmmm?  Anyone remember the Red House and the DC Blues Band?Oh yea, and Spacemanwhat a trip.  Thanks you guys, outasight.ReplyFrank GormlieMay 6, 2008 at 9:59 pmMarjorie  sure we remember the Red House. It will be referenced, I understand, in up-coming additions to the OB Rag history, as yet unwritten. The Red House was an activist home during most of the seventies, painted red, and was a center for the radical antiwar movement in OB . The structure still stands today, but the lot has been divided.I also remember the DC Blues Band. And Spaceman. I met him when I was a teenager and still have my Space Number, which will save me when the aliens land. Hey, when are they landing? We need something in this country.ReplyWinstonJuly 16, 2008 at 5:30 pmI lived in OB in the early to mid 60s. In  1965 I was 5 years old. Spaceman would come by our house from time to time. We lived on Coronado Ave. until the house we rented was sold and the land used to build apartments. One time Spaceman tried to get me to take money from my mothers purse to give to him. I remember people talking about his drinking. At that time he was pretty old. I think he made the news from time to time. I now reside in Tennessee.ReplyRay GavinDecember 7, 2009 at 6:00 pmWe moved into OB in 1954. we lived on seaside st and went to sacred heart academy. We were a big family 9 boys and 2 girls and of course we were catholic. early on i remember knowing the location of every fruit tree in the neighborhood. we played in the canyon at the north end of seaside. the trek to  beach was a daily summer routine. Down the street lived the Lockwoods and Ray Baumbaugh. Ob was a very quiet place to grow up in. The old house is still there at 2319. Phil meeker, dennis brooks, ronnie green, the lucido family and the bettencourts. Hangin out at the Rec center. I sold papers on Newport st in 57 and 58. The frichtels and Shermans. Always did a little shoplifting at Cornets. I loved the fries at the jack in the box on the coner of froud and sunset cliffs. Paul, one of my brothersthe Wolf.on his velsey-jacobs board. I remeber going to see Endless summer in 58 at the loma theaterwow ..what a time..ReplyFrank GormlieDecember 7, 2009 at 6:31 pmRay, wow, what a treasure trove of memories! I also lived on Seaside but much later. I went to high school with some of the Lockwoods and Marty Bettencourt. The only thing I differ with you about is when the original Endless Summer was shown. It was more like 1963 to 1964.  I saw it at the PB elementary school auditorium and the producer  I forget his name  gave a live narrative.ReplyLorne HillierDecember 28, 2009 at 6:24 pmGreetings OB! Ray, I am sure you remember one or the other Hillier at Sacred Heart, since there 12 of us! Your sister was in my classyep I did the tour from Kindergarten to 8th grade there, then on to Uni after that! Lots of religion in those days! Theresa was in my class with the Caseys,Beckmans, Lucidos and many more ( well NOT that manyI think we had 12 boys and about 18-20 girls in our class) We lived on the 4400 block of Santa Monicastraight up from the Tower..we checked the surf every day from the middle of the streetcounting the sets. The one thing I miss the most is the chicken from Ma and Pa ZekesI wonder if that recipe ever was passed along? It sure beat KFC all to hell!Replysteve ottingerJanuary 11, 2010 at 4:52 pmWow Frank! you lived on seaside too? and you remember the lockwoods? our house was strait across the street from the lockwoods! it was the big ugly pink house with the pillers. hell, Jimmy lockwood dam neer lived at our house. you also remember the Motts? these were some of our  good friends! Do you or any one els here remember the Ottinger family? we were well known as well.  I sure do miss the OB days, we left OB in 1974 and moved to coos bay oregon. It was one of the biggist mistakes my folks ever made. in fact to be totaly honest with you. In my life! I dont remember ever being as happy as I was as a young kid in ocean beach. When we left! I left my heart in  ocean beach, and took OB with me insted, to a place where Calis were not welcomed. It seemed the bikers here were the only ones who ever really did exsept me for who and what I was. But at the time a lot of them were from Cali as well, and no one here wanted to fuck around with  these boys. Now 44yrs old with unproudly! two murder trials under my belt. I fined my self once again facing yet another tial! one that ive ran from for 9yrs! wich is coming to an end this spring when I turn my self in, and if it goes well! then Im done with the law! once and for all!! Its time for some peace, love , and happyness to come my way again.  wish me luck my brother! and thanks again.. truly The OB- Kid!ReplyWayne RocheMay 24, 2010 at 3:21 pmWhat a blast from the past! I moved to California when I was 23 and went straight from the east coast, to Ocean Beach. I lived at a few places in O.B between March 78, and November, 79, but I started out in a very modest apartment above the shoe store on the corner of Newport and Bacon. Being from the NY suburbs, (New Rochelle, just north of NYC),  O.B. was sort of a culture shockone I embraced with open arms, and an open mind!  Like most kids my age at that time, I had this preconceived notion that I was going to be hangin out with alot of blonde, blue eyed Californians, listening to the Beach Boys while cruisin around in a T-Bird or a 49 Ford Woody with my long board bungeed to the topKawabunga!!!.wrong.Instead, it was a melting pot of souls from all over the countrythe world! In fact I do actually remember meeting one girl from San Diegoonly one. And NOBODY listened to the Beach Boys! Ok. Some of my fondest memories are:  Sunshine Co. Saloon, Clint Carey(The Spaceman), The Arizona at 6 in the morning!, The Black (my favorite head shop), Square Pan Pizza, Over the Top, Foggys Notion, learning to surf, and the partiesoh lord, the parties! But mostly, the people. Although my time in O.B. was only for two years, I met some of the finest people in my 54 years on this planet. I love and miss all of themPatti-Jo, Phil, Gypsy, Richard, Terra, and the list is just too long to type! I guess this is just me sharing some nostalgia with you. Sort of a walk down memory lane for me. You know, its funnyIve been asked over the years, if I ever get homesick, and the always say yesfor Ocean Beach. I felt instantly connected from the very first moments that I stood on Newport Ave., in front of the shoe store, looking west toward the beachand the bikinisand my home. So Ill close this by saying that with all that life hands us, good and bad, we all have at least one memory that makes us smile every time. For me, thats the time that I experienced O.B. As your Governor once saidIll be back.ReplyFrank GormlieMay 24, 2010 at 7:53 pmWayne, thanks so  much for visiting us, and please come back soon and often. Know most of the references that you mentioned. Some like Spaceman and Square pan Pizza are gone, some have been altered like the Arizona, and some are just still there, like the Black and the Sunshine Co.ReplyChuck MarlowMay 26, 2010 at 5:25 pmI grew up in OB.  My folks owned the Newport Pastry Shoppe across the street from the Strand.  Previously, they had the bakery at the corner of Newport and Bacon.  I remember the beach before the pier was built.  Destroyed a great left ride.  Do miss the beach as now I live in Sioux Falls, SD.ReplyFrank GormlieMay 26, 2010 at 7:45 pmChuck, welcome back, in a way. I definitely remember that great left before the pier was built. But I dont remember your folks bakery across from the Strand. I do remember one up a block east. At any rate, come back for a visit soon and often. Check out our scanned old original OB Rags and some of the history that surrounded its publication.peace.ReplyChuck MarlowMay 26, 2010 at 8:07 pmFrank:     If I remember right, the folks closed down the bakery in 1965.  Stiff competition from the bakery/coffee shop up the street and Safeway.  Remember Ma and Pa Zekes?  The folks sold the older bakery to them.  Must have been in the early 50s.  Its good to read about OB.  Hey, I even still have an OB sticker on my pickup driving around Sioux FallsSaw an OB sticker on a vehicle in the Black Hills last summerStill keep in touch with Doug Tillinghast.ChuckReplyFrank GormlieMay 26, 2010 at 8:34 pmSure, Chuck, Zekes is definitely in my teenage memory bank. A weird place but they sold great chicken out that side window on Bacon. The two young kids working for them turned out to be full-fledged KKK members complete with sheet, and they pranced around Newport a couple of times in full regalia. I dont remember your folks bakery but I can see why they had heavy competition from up the street, as that is the bakery I remember  wonderful fruit pastry squares! (No, Im not hungry, just on a dessert fast for 8 weeks.)The OB sticker does get around. A friend by the name of Michael Steinberg once lived in OB, had moved back east to the Carolinas, and was traveling back to Cali by Grayhound, and as the bus was pulling into the Bay Area in the early morning hours, the first car he sees on the bridge was a VW with an OB sticker.ReplyTEKAugust 29, 2010 at 1:43 pmChuck,Didnt you take drama at Mesa from Art and Woody?Art Noll passed away last year, and a bunch of people turned up,John Peters, Scott Beverly, Milt Woodruff, of course, lots ofthe old cast.Tom Kopache is one of the few actors to be a Star Trekregularbought an old Plymouth from him for $25,such a deal.  Last I heard, Barry Messer was a leader inthe Masons.I spent every spare evening in 1968-70 at the InBetween. Got to know Ann Dosher and some of the OB leading lights.  It wasalways fun when someone would stagger in and collapse, andwed load them into the 55 Chevy and cart them to the ERto get jumper cabled.  The Black moved to the InBetweensoriginal site.  I still cant imagine being an undergrad withouta place like thathow can people grow souls?  (Or barnacles,anyway?)The administration of the grants which kept the InBetween runningwould fill a book in itselfall the qualified social scientists were absent,doing research in some other country, and they hired some characterwith no qualifications at all.  Then there was a coup detat where someoutside characters tried to take over the board.  Dennis Ewald got acopy of the bylaws and stopped them cold.  (Id have like to see DEunder Roberts Rules(!)I remember The Lost Coin where the Campus Crusade for Christset up across the street and toward the ocean from the InBetween.Bunch of satanists showed up (IN CAPES!) and a weird time washad by all.There was always access to coffee in OB.  Truly, a civilized place.And Zekes Chicken Liver and Mayo sandwiches.Sigh.ReplyBoweenie BlossomAugust 24, 2010 at 7:13 pmOnly those of us who were lucky enough to be born and raised in OB know the true spirit of our community. Im the oldest daughter of Terry Boweenie Bowman. The Lockwoods are family to us and on my maternal side Im proud to be the cousin of David Velasquez (red house) anyone remember him? I miss the smell of Zekes, he lived across the street from me on Coronado, (his house smelled just like his resturant) and there was not a single thing you needed that Cornets did not have.  I love my town and have seen it go through so many changes, we must not give up on our town and what the hell is that line at hodads all about, and what is more hypocritical than all those new cars in OB peoples food store parking lot. Get with the OB spirit and put those homeless bums to work there for their food..REMEMBER the real OBPeoples if you wanted to buy you had to contribute.  Another thing  I find so absurd its hilairous is the OB Community Service facade where the Inbetween used to be.ReplydomaseriskAugust 29, 2010 at 11:34 pmwho was shaking his head back and forth knowingly Grissom shifted his eyes over at Brass,ReplyKathryn RogersOctober 19, 2010 at 12:02 pmI lived in Pt. Loma/OB from 1958 til 1970 something.  It sure is fun hearing of all the stories peeps have of the old home place.Like to clear up a few things and add a bit of history to the archives.My parents owned Homers Variety store prior to Cornets.  It was a true 5 & dime and its sign reflected that.  Cornets about put us out of business and was one of the first chain stores in Ob.The Methodist church had a really great lay youth teacher who came up with the idea of The Inbetween.  If you were looking towards the beach, it was on the right hand side of Newport and was called The Inbetween because it was in between 2 bars.  I helped open the place and was in on the painting of the map right inside the door.Across the street was The Paisley Pelican,  the 1st head shop prior to The Black.  I remember collecting banana peels, ala Mellow Yellow, there and used to sew clothing for sale in the shop.I still have pictures of the OB drum company and of Mike Stewart of the OB School House.  I used to live in the school house with Mad Madeline, Mikes mother and Mike who had the attic all to himself.We had a huge candy section in Homers  and we would fill up a sack and check out movies at The Strand.  We were a rowdy bunch and would take cap guns to the Westerns being shown and follow right along with the movie.  I remember being at the Strand one night and there was a war protest with peeps setting trash cans on fire in the middle of the street and then marching down one isle and up the other with war posters and chanting No more war!.There was an OB 9 (or 11, cant remember all that much! that went to jail for printing a How to Make a Moltov Cocktail in a local rag  was that you?  and getting a  lot of publicity and trouble from it.I used to hang with the local bikers, The Family, and went by Gypsy aka Kay.  It would be fun to see if anyone remembers me.Lots of fun in OB and I was right there in the heyday.  Wouldnt have traded those times for the world!ReplyKathryn RogersOctober 19, 2010 at 12:09 pmTo add to my very long post aboveI really have had a good laugh at some of the things that are being complained about now and fer sher were complained about back in the late 60s and early 70s.  The Wall at the bottom of Newport was torn down because of complaints that the hippies used to congregate there.  They tore it down then and now there are complaints because of the very same issues now?  Ahem.  some people never learn.Also, there were a lot of complaints in the 60s about panhandlers (and I of course had been guilty of that myself).  2010 redux!  LMAOSame as it ever was.ReplyFrank GormlieOctober 19, 2010 at 12:12 pmKathryn  welcome back! Youve added some great history. Go check out our recent posts on the Strand Theater.
