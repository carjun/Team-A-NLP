Swallowed. Absent. The opposite of "there."However you want to put it, the vast majority of journalists around the country won't have access to ALM's stories, including to its flagship The American Lawyer magazine. The company signed a licensing agreement with Westlaw, a major legal information provider, to be the exclusive holder of the ALM's content. It went into effect on May 1, according to this Westlaw press release on the agreement. Part of the deal: ALM didn't renew its contract with LexisNexis, which is where journalists found their often excellent articles on business, health, legal, and real estate issues and often cited the work to readers far outside the relatively small and specialized ALM circulation. "Westlaw is generally used only by attorneys," says Westlaw spokesman John Shaugnessy, who wasn't aware of  a single newspaper in America that subscribed to the site. "We aggregate content from all sorts of different sources and for us, lawyers are the sweet spot. And we are best served by mainting that focus." Locally, that means award-winning columnist Dan Christensen's work for the newspaper over many years is nowhere else to be found, including the article that first revealed Sheriff Ken Jenne's moonlighting activities that eventually ballooned into a federal investigation. Reporter Julie Kay's groundbreaking government and court reporting? Gone. The excellent coverage the newspaper has done on medical malpractice and other issues over the years? Bye-bye. Needless to say, ALM reporters are upset that their work is now confined largely to lawyers -- and for their own loss of the crucial Nexis database."It's sad that our stories aren't available to other media," says one DBR reporter. "People won't be aware of stories we have broken. And I use Nexis quite a bit and I'm afraid I won't have the information I need for my stories." The company's corporate leaders are aware of the rancor in the rank-and-file. "It has been an issue that some reporters have raised both internally and externally," says Ellen Siegel, ALM's vice president of license and business development. "We made a business decision," adds ALM spokesman Lee Feldman. "In general, we are aware of the issues for reporters. Westlaw is primarily used by the legal community and LexisNexis is primarily used by the journalism community. We are trying to fill that gap. But what you must understand is that our primary customers -- and I'm not saying the newspaper people aren't important to us -- are users within law firms. " He says that any reporter who is looking for specific ALM stories can contact him and he'll help provide the article (Feldman can be reached at 802-366-9001). He also says that temporary passes to Westlaw might be given under some circumstances. The fact is, though, that ALM's tremendous breadth of work will be all but lost to the population at large. And that is sad, indeed.

When it comes to the federal investigation of the sheriff, the Herald story by Wanda DeMarzo and Jay Weaver gave us a look at some of the furniture in the room while the Sentinel left us groping and stumbling around.Jenne's greatest violation of the public trust came in the hiring of lawyer/lobbyist/crony Tom Panza to "investigate" the crime-stats scandal. The sheriff diverted more than $1 million to Panza and other big-time political players for a total whitewash. The rest of the stuff is plenty dirty and should be pursued, but is penny ante next to the Panza payout. Wonder where Jenne is gonna find work after he gets out of jail?Speaking of good news stories, check out this Palm Beach Post ditty on the only grocery store in Pahokee . Reporter Sonja Isger shows us great reporting and smart writing in a powerful story. What's more outrageous than an entire town having to pay nearly five bucks for milk? Help Scheme The Help Team struck again -- and again -- over the weekend. A Help Team center package dominated the front page of the Metro section. There's an emotional shot of an elderly man at cemetery over a black-and-white wedding photo from the 50s. The headline: 'Everybody deserves respect and dignity.' You're thinking some awful mishap took place at the cemetery. And then you read the lead. All of this anguish and emotion is over ... weeds and an overgrown bush at Menorah Gardens. The guy is distraught over some poor landscaping. Then the local front Monday was bottom-heavy with a package on ... a leaning utility pole. Weeds, bushes, missing signs. Detritus. That's all you get. For all those ads of reporters' earnest faces, you get is detritus. This isn't about journalism, it's about public relations. It's obviously the dream of a P.R. man who doesn't give two shits about covering the news. It's about the Sentinel pandering to the readers, trying to make it seem personal, like they really care about you. Bull. They care about the idea that if it seems like they're caring about you, you'll buy their stinking newspaper, even it is about weeds, bushes, missing signs, leaning utility poles, and other detritus.

The Palm Beach Post has fired the 39-year-old reporter, who was a member of the Post's investigative team, after he wasarrested in February trying to buy crack cocaine after work. He never returned to work but to clean out his desk. "I'm trying to move forward right now," said Pacenti from his Boca Raton home this afternoon. "I know I'm a good journalist and I'm looking for employment. I have to take care of my family." Pacenti, who has two young daughters and whose wife Charlene works at the Miami Herald, told the Pulp after his arrest that a bout of severe depression had driven him to a notorious drug-infested area in West Palm Beach. The Post allowed him several weeks of medical leave and he has gone through rehab. He's going through a court-ordered program and, so long as he follows protocol, shouldn't see any jail time.  Post Editor John Bartosek is out of town and Managing Editor Bill Rose wasn't available, so I don't know all the facts. And I doubt I'm going to learn them, since companies rarely discuss these things. But the firing seems wrong to me on its face. I thought that the corporate world knew that drug addiction/alcoholism was a sickness rather than a crime (even if what Pacenti did is against the law). We've already dealt with the dangers of the latter disease this week and now we have a newspaper canning a veteran, award-winning reporter with a family to support for one mistake he made outside the workplace.  I'm not saying he necessarily should have been put right back on the investigative team, but there should have been a place for him at the newspaper. To fire him without a second chance sends the wrong message to all Post employees and it's not a decent thing to do.  Write Comment Email to Friend Crime WritingJudge Michael Gates Is A Boot-Licking IdiotBy Bob Norman,                                                            Fri., May 26 2006 @ 8:52AMCategories:                                                                                                                                                            Crime Writing Some quick (and not so quick) takes on the morning papers: Wanda DeMarzo tells us of the outrageous ruling by Circuit Judge Michael Gates in the trial of former BSO deputy Christian Zapata, the first public hearing of the crime stats scandal. Gates -- remember that name -- ruled that Sheriff Ken Jenne didn't have to testify after a BSO attorney wrote in a "protective order" that Jenne didn't know anything and would only be embarrassed. That's right, if you're sheriff you're basically above the law. DeMarzo also tells us that Gates had previously ruled that Zapata couldn't argue that he was following orders -- basically his entire defense. Unbelievable. Congratulations to Gates, though, for making himself Broward County's No. 1 douche bag. Bush Desecrates FlagBut who are we to question authority? Just ask the Sun-Sentinel's resident flag nazi, Ann Carter.  She writes in a column on the editorial page today that she noticed a tattered flag in the post-Hurricane Wilma debris. "I was stunned, not wanting to believe that someone who had cared enough to show love of country by flying the flag would shove a wornout banner, still attached to a short plastic pole, into the trash." Gee, Ann, maybe they were too busy with other things after the hurricane -- like trying to find food, gas, and water and fix the leaks in their roof -- to have a proper flag funeral. Few of us can be as heroic as Carter, who routinely puts her life at stake to protect the sanctity of the flag. How? She picks them up after they fall in traffic. "I've picked up maybe a dozen flags this way, risking my life most of the time. I think the flag is worth it." What an eagle eye this woman has for flags in distress. And finally she reminds us that there is only one good way to dispose of a flag: Burning. So, kids, listen to Ann Carter and go out and burn those flags! Seriously, you have to read this column. It's absolutely fanatical. The Palm Beach Post's sagely scribe Frank Cerabino nails the Jeb Bush/NFL commissioner thing to a tee in his blog. Great stuff. From the Palm Beach Post, some young men in Deerfield Beach have apparently done the unthinkable: Beating ducklings to death. I don't really have anything to say about that, but I had to mention it. And lastly the Miami Herald's Jennifer Lebovich gives us a brief story about the Deerfield Beach teenager who vandalized a Jewish book store (as the commentator mentions, more thorough versions come Sofia Santana in the Post and, I've since noticed, Chrystian Tejedor in the Sentinel).  The kid wrote: "Bun The Jews."  This could either mean that the young bigot is such an idiot that he managed to misspell "burn," or that he has a novel new approach to anti-semitism that perhaps also involves mustard, ketchup, pickles, onions, and sesame seeds. Connor Thomas Ranieri was charged with, among other things, "criminal mischief evidencing prejudice." Put him away for vandalizing a business, but that last part touches my First Amendment button. Either way, Connor Thomas has earned himself a spot on that list, right under Gates.

Check out the front page. Dwarfing excellent articles by Tony Doris (Liberti pleads guilty) and S.V. Date (about GOP and insurance companies -- and sorry, S.V., I don't know how to put the accent on that e), the newspaper ran a larger than life pic of Taylor Hicks under the horrid headline: "Meet Your New American Idol." Under the picture, the paper plugs Leslie Gray Streeter's blog, which had an unfortunate post wherein Streeter commented inreal time. Then came an "aftermath" post during which Streeter managed to write in a factual error that inflates the Idol phenomenon. She said the 63 million votes were "more than for any presidential election." It's actually more than have been cast for any winning candidate.The Herald did better, confining the Idol story to the left column on the front page, above the fold. Sentinel, which is known for throwing gratuitous hype on already over-hyped TV shows, played it right, with a box well under the fold. The Sentinel, however, must be called out for not covering the death of former editor Diann Slattery. From what I've heard, it seems clear that the newspaper dealt fairly with Slattery when she worked for them. Yet the paper published only a paid obit for the editor who worked 12 years and went on to manage Miami Today. Even the Herald, where she never worked, published a staff-written obit  to mark the journalist's death.

I rewrote a specific part of it about six times -- publishing a different version here each time. It gnawed at me. I finally cut it out altogether. It was about Diann's drinking.  I never met Slattery, never even had heard of her before I was told about her death on Monday. They said she collapsed and had gone into a seizure while doing some research at the Plantation library. She later slipped into a coma. After several days of hospitalization, her heart stopped early Monday morning. Everybody I talked to about Diann said she had a drinking problem. They said she'd gone to rehab, but fell off the wagon. That she'd get drunk at lunch, at employment functions, at the office. That it had cost Slattery her vaunted job as Broward Metro Editor at the Sun-Sentinel, her job at Miami Today, and, ultimately, her life. The drinking, they said, had destroyed her body.  I brought up the subject with her last boss, Miami Today editor and publisher Michael Lewis. "That's funny, the Sun-Sentinel never told me anything about that," he said. "The only issue I ever had with Diann was that she worked too much. It was a serious issue. She never wanted to leave the building."Did he know her to have had a drinking problem? "There aren't many reporters who don't drink," said the veteran newspaperman, before regaling me with a few anecdotes from his long career in journalism that featured a lot of half-drunk bottles of alcohol he'd seen on many a city desk.  So when I wrote the post yesterday, I had information that she had had a serious drinking problem at the Sentinel. And I had information indicating that it wasn't a problem at Miami Today. My instinct was to include something about the drinking because I thought the fact might help explain her career arc and possibly her early death. But I didn't know those things. What if the problem was exaggerated? What if she just had a few binges? What if it had gotten blown out of proportion by a bunch of talk over the years? I put it all kinds of ways. She battled alcoholism. No, that may not be true. That she battled the bottle. That she had been "portrayed by some as an old-school hard drinker and by others as a troubled soul struggling with unknown demons." None of it seemed right. So I killed it. Then, in the afternoon, I got the e-mail with the subject line, "Diann Slattery."  "Do you know even a tenth of this story?" it read. "CALL ME." I called the number. It was a reporter who'd worked for Slattery at Miami Today, a 37,000-circulation newspaper founded by Lewis in 1983. The publication is aimed at the business community and, despite having only a handful of newspeople who are paid relatively low wages, has a solid reputation.    "This is terrible story, a classic story about how the bottle destroyed a phenomenal journalist," the reporter said with near-reverence for the profundity of the human tragedy that had occurred at the newspaper.   Slattery was a disaster at Miami Today, the reporter said, an obvious alcoholic in terrible health.  "She totally let herself go," said the reporter. "She would roll in at 4 in the afternoon and proceed to get hammered throughout the day and trap us there until late at night. Weird things would happen to our copy. Mistakes would get edited into the copy. She would destroy the copy sometimes because she was totally trashed." Another reporter who worked for Slattery at Miami Today confirmed these things (as did anecdotal evidence from a half-dozen other sources who knew her through the years). Slattery would often stay in the building until the early morning hours. She'd go to her car periodically throughout the day and had a bottle of Scope at her ready. Sometimes she'd be found passed at her desk in the morning. She missed work, suffered strange injuries, and behaved erratically and at times abusively. And it went on for five years. While Lewis had said that Slattery had left the newspaper last fall to take care of her late mother's estate, the reporter told me Diann had been fired in September for work-related issues, including failure to show up for work. "[Lewis] should have done something," said the reporter. "He had to know what was going on."But the reporter conceded that everybody who worked there during those years should have done something. Everybody knew about Diann's drinking, even though she meticulously hid her bottles (likely in her car). That's the truly horrific aspect of the story: Nobody did anything about it. The reporters, however, did have a reason to keep quiet: They feared being fired if they brought it up.  And there was a feeling of inevitability that Slattery, who lived alone in Plantation, was set in her ways and wouldn't be moved. "She went Leaving Las Vegas," said the reporter.When I called Lewis, whom you may know from his regular appearances on the buttoned-up political show Issues on Channel 2, he continued to deny any knowledge of Slattery's drinking problem. When I told him that former staffers had told me that Diann was a raging alcoholic, he said: "That very well may be, but I saw no evidence of it. I don't think she was an alcoholic, but I'm not going to talk about this." I asked him if she had been fired in September for failure to show up to work. "That's not true. Diann no longer works at the paper. Diann is deceased." Did he fire her in September? "I'm not going to discuss internal matters." Did staffers confront him with the issue of Diann's drinking? "I'm not going to talk about that." But this isn't about Michael Lewis. None of us can know how we would have acted in the same situation and, to be sure, this is an age-old occupational hazard in the newspaper business. Even if Lewis had confronted the issue, it might not have helped Diann.  But that doesn't mean we can't learn from her story -- or hope that, when confronted with a similar situation, we might be able to help.

Editor & Publisher's  Steve Outing wrote about the Post's web-feedin', bloggin', multi-taskin' reporters in his recent column. He singled out columnists Frank Cerabino and  Leslie "Yummy" Streeter, assistant business editor Greg Stepanich, and deputy photo editor John Lipinot as folks who make the old-school reporter seem "lazy." But he gave the most attention to cops reporter Rochelle E.B. Gilken, whose Pulpish writings have been featured on this here site on a few occasions. She's a reporter, Internet feeder, blogger, and football fantasy columnist all in one. "I think that Gilken is the archtypical example of the modern newspaper reporter," Outing writes. "While not every reporter today is as busy as her, nor has as many cross-media responsibilities yet, the newspaper reporting profession is clearly headed in her direction." No doubt Gilken is smokin' -- and I know first-hand how this convergence thing can up your workload. And anybody who doesn't live in a dirt hut knows this Internet thing holds the fundamental future of American journalism. But calling the reporters of, say, the 70's and 80's lazy by comparison is off-base. There have always been lazy newspaper people, but reporters have been notorious for working ridiculous hours since the days of Citizen Kane and The Front Page. My father was a reporter and he worked so much I wasn't sure what he looked like until he showed up at my high school graduation. The obsessive workaholic journalist is a damn cliche -- and "multi-tasking" didn't have anything to do with creating it. Only in the past they were digging up information instead of feeding the web. Something's got to give. There is no doubt the print version of newspapers is going to be slightly diminished as we go more and more Internet happy. Investigative and in-depth journalism will undoubtedly suffer some setbacks as well (and there's not much room for loss in that department). Anybody who tells you otherwise is blowing smoke up a place where the sun doesn't shine. It's a precarious balancing act -- and the future of journalism depends on how well the transition is made. That's why great leadership (whatever the hell that might be) is needed at newspapers now more than ever.

Slattery, who was 46 years-old, last held the position of managing editor at Miami Today. Prior to that, she spent 12 years at the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, where she worked as graphics editor, projects editor, and Broward Metro Editor."I can't really talk about her hobbies, because her main interest was journalism," says Miami Today publisher Michael Lewis. "She was thinking journalism 100 percent of the time. Everything to her related to news and how it affected the community. And that was real important to us." Slattery, a graduate of the University of Florida, came to Fort Lauderdale from her hometown of Sarasota, where she worked on the metro desk at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. "There are a lot of editors in this world who are good at copy editing and conceptualizing stories, but can't manage people at all," says Sentinel social services reporter Bill Hirshman, whom Slattery hired 12 years ago. "Journalists are notoriously difficult to manage and she dealt with her staff as human beings and encouraged them and made them feel like there was somebody in a glass office that genuinely cared about them both as a professional and as person."  Much of her time last year was spent caring for her late mother and handling the affairs of the family estate, says Lewis. According to her paid obituary, which was published this morning in the Sentinel:  The biggest thrills for Diann were the breaking news story and "the scoop" -- whipping the journalistic competition. Those who knew her well enjoyed the two sides of Diann. The brash side: shouting out commands in the newsroom or boisterously arguing sports over a beer. The soft side: her devotion for her staffers; her affection for "Erica" and "Jeremy" on the TV soap All My Children; her weekly nail appointment, not to be missed; her steadfast care for her dying mother, who passed away just a year ago. Slattery was hospitalized after suffering an apparent seizure at a library near her home in Plantation. She died early Monday morning following severe medical complications. She will be buried during a private service at at Palms Funeral Home in Sarasota.
