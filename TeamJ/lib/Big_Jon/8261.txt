Just who is Ted Williams?    Cleveland :  OH :  USA|Jan 07, 2011By DetroitReports        3 0     Views: 234      Theres lots of talk on the web and in the media about Ted Williams, so just who is he? His golden voice has many in aww. Some say he is a drug abuser, thief, liar and one particular man from Ohio is upset about Williams instant fame.Personally I think he is just human. A human that once fell down on his luck and turned to drugs for comfort. But who of us really think he doesnt deserve a second chance?For those that do, tell me that you have walked through life mistake free? You cant can you? And for that man that is so not willing to forgive and forget, lets hope he never make a mistake and need someone to forgive him.Thankfully enough Williams bad luck has turned around and he is getting that second chance he needed. I say kudos to the Cleveland Cavaliers for their support of Mr. Williams.Its good to see someone has a forgiving heart and isnt afraid to let the world know.        1 of 5              Ok, He has a past...But how many of us doesn't? Everyone deserves a second chance.

Below is a comment I wrote to comment on another allvoices article that discusses his "rap Sheet"..I think it's worth reposting here;While I agree with you that everyone deserves a second chance but I am a bit uneasy about the mania about Ted. While it IS true he has a golden radio voice and is a man "down on his luck" I can't help but wonder about the tens of thousands of others we pass by that panhandle and inhabit the on ramps of myriad city freeways. Do the thousands that sleep under bridges and push shopping carts through a cold America not deserve the same chance..the same golden promise? Was the Man with the Golden Voice and the fluke Youtube video that got him attention (and fame!) a way to ignore our collective guilt for ignoring all the other Teds?I wish him luck. It is truly a Cinderella story. We like that.We like happy endings and fairytales. How many other ex-felons and drug addicts out there have skills and energy and deserve the same chance? Is Ted the exception and our weekly "feel good" story that allows us now to turn our back on the rest of our troubled and left out citizens?I hope not.
