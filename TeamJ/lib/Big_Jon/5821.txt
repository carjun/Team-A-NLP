David Fincher won for best director and Aaron Sorkin for best screenplay.The critics reached overseas for the best actress honor, naming Italian star Giovanna Mezzogiorno for her role in "Vincere." The film follows the rise to power of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, with him abandoning his wife and child along the way.Supporting actor awards went to Geoffrey Rush for "The King's Speech" and Olivia Williams for "The Ghost Writer."The society, founded in 1966, is composed of 61 film critics from across the country, including Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, the Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan, The Wall Street Journal's Joe Morgenstern and David Denby of The New Yorker.While these critics' choices rarely reflect top honors at the Academy Awards, the New York-based society helps draw attention to new films in advance of the Oscars, staged in late February by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.On Saturday, society members issued a statement calling for a re-examination of the movie rating system set by the Motion Picture Association of America.The critics praised a decision to change the NC-17 rating for "Blue Valentine" to an R, but they questioned others. They singled out "The King's Speech," a drama about King George VI's attempt to overcome his speech impediment, which was rated R for "language"  moments when he's told to swear to ease his stammer.Story continues belowAdvertisement "It's clear the board has become an agency of de facto censorship," read the statement from the critics, who suggested a revision of the current system.The society also condemned Iran's recent sentencing of directors Jafar Panahi and Mohammad Rasoulof to six years in prison. Both were banned from filmmaking for 20 years for "colluding in gatherings and making propaganda against the regime."The critics urged the Iranian government to release the directors, saying their "work can only further the advancement of such values as justice, compassion, tolerance, and human dignity."Among foreign language films, "Carlos"  French director Olivier Assayas's 5 1/2-hour-look at the life of the global terrorist dubbed "Carlos the Jackal"  was voted best.

Maybe there were one or two too many dream levels/special effects to keep it focused on the real message of dealing with a lost loved one. And the scene in the elevator jumped the shark for me.King's Speech is a special movie with Firth taking us inside his character like none I've seen in years. (Hooper did similar excellent direction in D amned United last year).Bale and Melissa Leo's work in the Fighter is very strong, both creating totally believable and iconic characters.Annette Benning is ALWAYS good, and her unvarnished character in the Kids are Alright deserves notice.Polanski's Ghost Writer was a slick, dreamlike Hitchcock homage.Toy Story 3 had some sly depth that tapped into all of us with kids heading off to college.Too bad cinema is d ea d.

It succeeds more on writing and acting, and Soderberg did not get in the way - which is also good directing in my book.  Go back and watch Che, Traffic, The Limey, he has a nice touch.  That being said, I am a huge fan of Memento and consider Nolan one the most promising writer/directors today.Having read Woodrell's book, I look forward to watching Winter's Bone tonight.
