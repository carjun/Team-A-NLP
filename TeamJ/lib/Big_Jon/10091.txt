Residents in Faenza described the birds falling to the ground like 'little Christmas balls' with strange blue stains on their beaks. Initial tests on up to 8,000 of the doves indicated that the blue stain could have been caused by poisoning or hypoxia.  A witness told www.examiner.com: 'We have no idea why this happened all of a sudden. 'The doves just started falling one-by-one then in groups of 10s and 20s.' Hypoxia, a lack of oxygen, is known to reason bewilderment and illness in animals. It is also a common precursor to altitude sickness. Experts said results from tests on the doves will not be available for at least a week. They said that cold climate could have caused the birds' deaths as the flock was swept into a high-altitude wind storm before falling to the earth. It comes after two million dead fish were establish to have washed up on shores in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. The alarming find is being answerable by authorities in Maryland on the stress caused by unusually cold water and overbreeding in the middle of spot fish. That investigation come just days after the deaths of an estimated 100,000 fish in northwest Arkansas, which is being blamed on disease. A declaration by the Maryland Department of the Environment said: 'Natural causes appear to be the reason. 'Cold water stress exacerbated by a large population of the affected species (juvenile spot fish) appears to be the cause of the kill.' Preliminary tests of the water in Chesapeake Bay have showed the excellence was acceptable, officials said. The statement added: 'The affected fish are almost exclusively juvenile spot fish, three to six inches in length. 'A recent review showed a very strong population of spot in the bay this year. An increased juvenile population and limited deep water habitat would likely compound the effects of cold irrigate stress.'        1 of 6         bad news ..      hitlor is based in Kathmandu, Kathmandu, Nepal,and is Stringer for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (36.7%) China (23.3%) Canada (13.0%) United Kingdom (5.6%) 48 other countries (18.0%)           READ MORE: 000 turtle doves fall dead in Italy with strange blue stain on their beaks, Chesapeake Bay, animal deaths, Hypoxia, mass animal, Fish, turtle doves, Turtle Dove, strange blue, Water, spot fish, Aquatic ecology, disasters-news, oxygen, Italy, environment, nature, Faenza, Fisheries, biology, Ichthyology, blue stain, Chemical oceanography,  Mystery of mass animal death epidemic deepens after 8   More News From: Faenza :  Italy     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 7            Reply  Posted By     itobin53|1 dayagothis is really horrible and really disturbing. so many bird and fish deaths, the environment is in an upheaval.
