Soon they know that the rivers and lakes will be frosting up and ice will begin to build.  Thoughts of gathering together portable ice fishing shelters as well as other needed ice fishing supplies starts running through many a dedicated fisherman's mind.    Gathered together is a variety of ice fishing videos for readers of this hub who may wish to see how this sport is accomplished. And for people who take part in this sport and the ice is not yet thick enough to safely start one's ice fishing...watching these videos can make you dream of the day when you will be enjoying this type of activity first-hand.

The very first and most important thing to do each year     is to make sure that enough time has passed that the waterway one is on whether it be a creek, river or lake has had time enough to not only freeze but that the ice is thick enough to support the weight of things that one wishes to have upon the ice. Every year there are accidents when not only people but equipment, snowmobiles and even cars are lost when the ice breaks and swallows what was once on top of the ice.  Sadly, some people and even pets are lost due to carelessness or ignorance.    Thus, if one is not experienced in such things, heed the local experts who know about such things and wait until that frozen water will afford the fun winter activities in which one wishes to participate.  4 inches of solid ice should make it safe for walking. Another couple of inches should be added before one drives such things as snowmobiles out onto the ice. If one is going to drive one's lightweight car onto the ice, which many fishermen do to transport their supplies, be sure that the ice is 7 to 12 inches thick. For full-sized trucks, the ice is recommended to be from 14 to 16 inches thick according to the Wikipedia link.   Where my Dad grew up as a child on Okauchee Lake in Wisconsin, it was common that every year a number of cars would be lost by breaking through the ice.  Snowmobiles did not yet exist.    Back in those days it was just considered to be bad luck and a shame. As long as the people did not lose their lives, people just shrugged it off and laughed about it. The bottom of the lake became littered with such things and since it was fairly deep, the cars, sleds or other things remained there.  Now because of environmental concerns, if a car is known to have fallen through the ice, every effort is made to recover it as soon as possible so that contaminants do not leech into the water.  It is no longer a laughing matter.

But certainly the use of augers such as they now utilize is much easier and creates an even nicely shaped hole through which one can drop a line and fish.Also one would expend much less energy in making that fishing hole in the ice with the use of an auger. One obviously needs to dress warmly and the new microfibers found in clothing helps that.Ice fishing supplies includes such things as ice fishing tackle, ice fishing lures, ice fishing poles or rods and reels, ice fishing spears (for those who choose that method of fishing), and so forth among many other offerings.There are ice fishing stores and for those who live in colder climates where ice fishing becomes an easy pass-time each year, one can probably find almost anything one might need in such a store.One might still wish to check sites like Amazon as often these needed fishing supplies are discounted over what one might pay in an ice fishing store. It pays to shop around! Obviously one will have many of these ice fishing accessories for years once one makes a purchase. They also make great gifts!

We would each bring our own sack lunches.While there we would then work on handicrafts and visit. It was a fun way to pass some of the bitter cold winter days.One of the ladies lived on a waterway. Looking out her back windows each winter there were always an assortment of ice fishing structures grouped not that far apart and not that far from the shoreline.Apparently for ice fishermen, this type of gathering is as much for fun and conviviality (and probably some drinking as well...for those that imbibed in alcoholic spirits) as much as the ice fishing was intended to catch fish for supper.Many of them when they would catch a walleye fish or some type of other fish would measure it and then release it back into the water as many of these embedded videos show.Ice fishing was as much for bragging rights.....who caught the biggest fish?.....as much as it was to actually provide food for the dinner table. Some of both undoubtedly occurs.It was quite a sight to see all of those ice fish structures and men moving about on the ice so close to the houses when most of the year those same home owners had the wide expanse of the lapping waters of the lake as their view.Giant Muskie (Musky) Ice Fishing VideoTrophy pike fishing through the ice!How does a 24.5 pound Sturgeon fit through 8 inch holeIce Fishing Tackle29 - Pc.

I'll take some excursions into the snow but that seems cold! Great post as always Dear Peggy!DiamondRN11 days ago You're bringing back some fond memories, Peggy. I remember ice-fishing at 4-below zero on the Kalamazoo River near Saugatuck, Michigan and getting Northern Pike (similar to a Musky) that were so big that two of them fell out of the gunny sack that I was carrying them in on the way back to the car. One of them was 54 inches, the other just a little smaller. Here is the link to a picture of a 54-incher >>> http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m66/scotto01/Hudahoglund11 days ago Herre in ice fishing country there was a news item on TV a couple of days ago about being careful about driving out on the ice. If not sure, don't do it. Mostly they talked about how much it costs to get a vehicle out. Also damage to the car or truck itself. They also recommended checking with your insurance company to see if that is covered.I recall that before portable fishing shelters ppeople drove their cars out on the ice and removed the floorboards and fished from the car.GusTheRedneck11 days ago Howdy Peggy - It has been many a moon since I did walleyes, and never atop the ice. Can't do walleyes around Houston unless you are lucky enough to pick up on one of Peggy's fine articles.Gus :-)))Peggy W11 days ago Hi Micky,As far as ice fishing being a lonely business, from what I have seen there are generally some buddies, even pets out on the ice keeping the fishermen company.  I guess some people might do ice fishing as a solitary experience but then people who enjoy fishing in general find it to be relaxing and exciting at the same time when they catch something.  Lots of time for contemplation.Speaking of excursions into the snow...leaving a link to your latest post which is SPECTACULAR!  Anyone reading this should head on over to Micky's hub:  http://hubpages.com/hub/The-Primo-Hillsbro-Snow-ShThanks, Micky!Jeff May11 days ago While I love getting out for long hikes in wintery woods, I seldom fish during the winter.  I fly fish May through October in clear Missouri streams.Peggy W11 days ago Hi DiamondRN,Nice that this ice fishing for walleye hub and the ice fishing videos brought back happy memories of your ice fishing on the Kalamazoo River.  That 54 inch pike fish photo is amazing!!!  Thanks for leaving the link and also for leaving a comment.Peggy W11 days ago Hi dahoglund,Probably good advice to remind people of the costs of having to retrieve cars and such if they fall through the ice...not to mention reiterating the safety issues for life and limb.  For sure you now live in ice fishing country!  Have you ever engaged in ice fishing?Peggy W11 days ago Hi Gus,For SURE! there is no ice fishing in Houston!  Haha!  But I still have my memories of seeing the portable ice fishing shelters in Wisconsin Rapids each year when we lived there.  Thanks for your comment.Peggy W11 days ago Hi Jeff,Oh, I still remember seeing the movie "A River Runs Through It" and thought that the fly fishing was so beautiful.  I have spotted some fly fishing in places like Yosemite and on the Umpqua River in Oregon while on vacation.  I must admit that there is a certain beauty in fly fishing that far surpasses ice fishing for walleyes or any other kind of ice fishing...at least in my eye.  Have you written a hub about your fly fishing?Jeff May10 days ago Hi Peggy. I see you found your answer. :)tonymac0410 days ago Looks like a very cold sport! But beautiful. For us living in the warmer climes this all looks so exotic! Thanks for sharing - I enjoyed it!Love and peaceTonydahoglund10 days ago Peggy WI went Ice fishing once. I swore never again. A high school friend and his brother invited me to go with them. We walked to a lake about a mile of two away from home as we were too young to drive yet. We chipped holes in the ice--no shelters, we were out in the open. I have always had a problem with low or slow blood circulation so my extremities get cold. Same problem with ice skating.I didn't get much chance to talk to this guy at our high school reunion about five years ago but he was dressed as a cowbou and his wife as a dance hall girl. They had gone out to your part of the country and are running some sort of western ranch and entertainment show.Cheryl J.10 days ago Peggy,Ice fishing for Walleye looks like a fun and cold sport.

Thanks!Peggy W10 days ago Hi Tony,I suppose ice fishing would look exotic to those who have never experienced nor seen it being done.  Glad that I could at least give you a view of it through these ice fishing videos.  Thanks for the comment.Peggy W10 days ago Hi dahoglund,Just watching those videos as the men reach into that frigid water to pull up the walleyes or other fish while they are ice fishing makes me shiver.  A portable ice fishing shelter or not...that alone would make one cold and wet.  Brrr!  Those are what you might call dedicated fishermen!Peggy W10 days ago Hi Cheryl,Glad that you liked this hub about ice fishing for walleyes and the ice fishing videos some of which showed the portable ice fishing shelters, etc.  Certainly different from what we would ever see living in Houston!katrinasui10 days ago Ice fishing for Walleye looks like a fun.
