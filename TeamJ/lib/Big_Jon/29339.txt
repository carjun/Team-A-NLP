At least 32 people died in the attacks, all of them Coptic Christians.[1][3] About 97 others were injured.[4] This was the deadliest act of violence against Egypt's Christian minority in a decade, since the Kosheh massacre in 2000 left 21 Copts dead.[5]Contents1 Background2 Bombing3 Reactions3.1 Coptic community in Egypt3.2 Coptic community in the diaspora3.3 Domestic3.4 International community4 Funeral5 Further threats6 External links7 See also8 References[edit] BackgroundIn the months prior to the massacre, the religious ambiance in Egypt had been clouded by anti-Christian propaganda, the most significant of which was the public allegation made by Mohammad Salim Al-Awa that the Coptic Orthodox Church was storing weapons in churches and monasteries.[6] Al-Awa also accused the Coptic Church of holding Christian women who convert to Islam as hostages,[6] in reference to Kamilia Shehata and Wafaa Constantine, who had allegedly converted to Islam from Christianity.[7][8][9] A wave of Muslim protests against Copts followed these allegations, including calls to boycott Coptic businesses and products.[10] The Synod of Coptic priests in Alexandria described these allegations as "anti-Christian mobilization and lies."[11]A group in Iraq with ties to Al Qaida announced a few months before the Alexandria massacre that all Christians in the Middle East were now considered "legitimate targets" in response to the alleged accusation that the Coptic Church was holding the two women as hostages.[7][8][9]Two weeks before the bombing an Islamist website called for attacks on a list of Egypt's churches, and included the church that was hit.[7][12]Hours before the explosion, Salafi Muslims held demonstrations in front of Alexandria's Al Qa'ed Gohar Mosque against the Coptic Orthodox Church and against Pope Shenouda III, repeating the Iraqi Al-Qaeda threats against Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church.[13][edit] BombingPart of a series of articles onModern persecution ofCoptic ChristiansMassacres2011 Alexandria bombingNag Hammadi MassacreKosheh MassacreIncidentsAlexandria riotsAttack on Saint Fana MonasteryNotable figuresSidhom Bishay Master MalatiMohammed HegazyBahaa el-AkkadMark GabrielGroupsMuslim Brotherhoodal-Gama'a al-IslamiyyaIslamic JihadTopicsPersecution of CoptsHuman rights in EgyptApostasy in IslamCriticism of IslamThis box: viewtalkeditA car exploded that was parked in front of the Coptic Orthodox church of Saint Mark and Pope Peter in the Sidi Bishr neighbourhood in Alexandria.[4][8][12] Later, an Interior Ministry statement on the official news agency declared that the attack was a suicide bomber and not a car explosion.[4][8][14][15][16]According to eyewitnesses, a green koda car pulled up outside the church shortly after midnight. Two men got out, one of them talked shortly on his mobile phone then left the scene. The explosion occurred almost immediately thereafter. The car carried a bumper sticker with the words "the rest is coming".[13]At the time of the blast, several thousand Coptic Christians were attending midnight prayer service at the church at the occasion of the new year.[4][12] The explosion resulted in scattered body parts, destroyed cars and smashed windows.[4][7] 21 Coptic Christians were killed immediately following the explosion, and about 97 people  most of whom Christians  were injured.[2][4][8][12] The remains were covered with newspapers until they were brought inside the church.[13] Two more victims died in the hospital over the few days following the attack, raising the total number to 32, all of whom were Coptic Christians.[1]Forensic testing confirmed that the explosive device used was homemade and contained nails and ball-bearings.[16] The Interior Ministry stated that the bomb was filled with small pieces of metal to serve as shrapnel,[17] and that a foreign-backed suicide bomber may have been responsible.[17][edit] Reactions[edit] Coptic community in EgyptMany Copts felt the Egyptian state security was in favor of the bombings.[13][18] One member of the Coptic community declared, "The government is the reason this happened. They are the terrorists who attack us every day."[18]Following the bombing, several thousand Copts took to the streets in protest.[4] Furious Christians clashed with Egyptian police and Egyptian security forces.[4][19] Christians and Muslims pelted each other with rocks, and cars were torched.[7] After these overnight protests, more than 100 Christians protested the following morning near the church that was attacked, chanting "We sacrifice our souls and blood for the Holy Cross" and "O Mubarak, the heart of the Copts is on fire".[4][7] The Egyptian police reacted by firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the Christians.[4][5][13]In Cairo, about 4,000 Christians and Muslims demonstrated against terrorism in the predominantly Christian neighborhood of Shubra.[20] The demonstration lasted for six hours and was joined by both government and opposition members of the Egyptian parliament and a number of political figures, including a former minister and Tomorrow Party leader Ayman Nour. In the same neighborhood of Shubra, thousands of Coptic Christians clashed with riot police for three days, resulting in injuries to both Coptic civilians and riot police soldiers.[18]Thousands of Copts demonstrated at Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Cairo against the Alexandria bombings.[21][22][23]Thousands of Copts also demonstrated at the Monastery of Saint Simon the Tanner in Cairo.[24] The demonstrators called for the resignation of the Egyptian government. They chanted, "With our souls and blood we redeem our Cross". They then clashed with the Egyptian security forces, resulting in injuries to 12 of the Coptic demonstrators.[21][22]In addition, thousands of Coptic Christians demonstrated outside the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs and the state television buildings for two consecutive days.[21][22]In the Upper Egyptian city of Mallawi, about 2,000 Copts demonstrated against the Alexandria bombings, expressing their will to die as martyrs.[25]Pope Shenouda III strongly condemned the "criminal assault", blaming it on "forces that wish no good for Egypt".[26] The Pope also called upon the government to "speedily arrest and prosecute the perpetrator of this criminal act."[26] His personal secretary said the incident had "severely grieved us, because it is very alien to the love and harmony in which the nation lives".[27]The top cleric in Alexandria, the Patriarchal Vicar Hegumen Ruweis Marcos, said that the Egyptian government and security forces wanted to blame the bombing on a suicide bomber instead of a car bomb in order to write off the crime as something carried out by a lone attacker.[4] He also denounced the lack of protection in front of the church, stating he was surprised to find only three soldiers and one officer guarding the church at such a sensitive time in spite of the recent numerous threats against Copts.[4]The Synod of priests in Alexandria unanimously criticized the lax attitude of the Egyptian authorities towards the public expression of hatred against Coptic Christians.[11] In a statement issued by the Synod, the priests said that the attack on the church was "the result of anti-Christian mobilization and the lies recently propagated against the Coptic Orthodox Church."[11]Hany el-Gezeiry, one of the most prominent figures in the Coptic community, blamed the Egyptian security forces for turning a blind eye against the Salafi demonstrations in Alexandria, which took place on the day of the bombings.[13] "Security should know that those who demonstrated are the hand of Al-Qaida in Egypt. They should have arrested them to investigate who was behind them. They want to destroy Egypt from inside, and the government kept quiet, giving them a free hand to do what they wanted. I believe Al-Qaida achieved what it wanted."[13] El-Gezeiry also commented on the schadenfreude expressed by Muslims following the bombings, as some of them were heard chanting Allah Akbar.[13]On the Sunday following the bombings, Coptic parishioners at the bombed church of Saint Mark and Pope Peter expressed anger, and protested discrimination that Christians in Egypt are face.[11] One of the parishioners declared "in this country, we cannot even pray in churches." Another blamed the anti-Coptic attitudes spread by the Islamic mosques. The priest of the church blamed "Islamic fanaticism" and "Islamic extremism".[11] He called upon the Egyptian government to ensure the rights of the Christians in "life, prayer and work".[11]Officials of the Coptic Orthodox Church announced that prayers for Eastern Christmas, celebrated on January 7, would still be held, but that celebrations would be canceled.[18][edit] Coptic community in the diasporaMemorial services were held in Coptic churches across Europe in memory of the victims of the bombing.[28]The Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom issued an official statement condemning the massacre, and expressing concern that incidents of violence and terror against Christians in Egypt were increasingly spiraling out of control.[29] The statement also criticized the fact that crimes against the Copts in Egypt were going unchecked and unresolved, and their perpetrators were not brought to justice.[29]In Montreal, Canada, all five Coptic churches in the city decided to proceed under tightened security with the Eastern Christmas Eve mass on the eve of Eastern Christmas, which falls on January 7th, but decided not to hold any celebrations.[30][31] The celebrations were canceled in honor of the victims of the Alexandria massacre, and money that was to be spent on the celebrations was sent to the families of the victims in Alexandria.[31][edit] DomesticThe Egyptian government issued a statement immediately following the bombing blaming "foreign elements" for the planning and execution of the bombing.[12][8]The main opposition group the Muslim Brotherhood condemned the attack[32] , and called upon Muslims to protect churches.[33]President Hosni Mubarak promised in a televised address that terrorists would not destabilize Egypt or divide Christians and Muslims. He said the attack "carries evidence of the involvement of foreign fingers" and vowed to pursue the perpetrators.[4][8][34] Many doubt that that the perpetrators will be pursued, citing the Mubarak regime's preference for handling violence against the countrys Christian minority through a reconciliation process between the perpetrators and the victims, rather than prosecution of the perpetrators.[35]The governor of Alexandria, Adel Labib, accused Al Qaida of planning the bombing, without giving any further details.[7][36]Many Egyptians expressed their disappointment regarding the government's claims that Al Qaida and foreign elements were behind the massacre,[18] seeing those claims as a way for the government to evade the issue of growing sectarian divisions in the country.[18]In a message to Pope Shenouda III, Patriarch TheodoreII of the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria strongly condemned the "brutal criminal attack" against a church "where prayers were being recited for the peace of Egypt, for the peace of those in power, and for the peace of the world."[37] Patriarch TheodoreII also described the victims as "Martyrs of the Church".[37]A spokesman for Al-Azhar University denounced the attack saying it targeted "Egyptian national unity." He also urged both Christians and Muslims to remain calm.[citation needed]Both government and independent newspapers warned that civil war could break out in Egypt unless Muslims and Christians close ranks.[21][22] Newspapers also urged the Egyptian government to focus on the situation of the Copts, who often complain of discrimination.[21][22][38]In a provocative act a high-ranking state security officer walked over to a row of demonstrators standing vigil in Cairo and slowly, methodically blew out the white candles they were holding to remember those who died in the attack.[18]The Egyptian daily newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm wrote:Do not say that the criminal terrorists are not Egyptian. They are Egyptian Muslims who are putting the nation on one hand and Islam on the other, and favoring the hand of Islam over the nation.[18][edit] International community Pope Benedict XVI of the Roman Catholic Church denounced the attacks in his New Year address.[7] He also appealed for religious freedom and religious tolerance in the Middle East, and urged world leaders to defend Christians against discrimination, abuse and religious intolerance which are today striking Christians in particular.[39] The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the attack in the Egyptian city of Alexandria by issuing the following statement on the day of the terrorist attack: "Moscow strongly condemns this criminal attack of extremists. Such bloody acts, resulting in the death and suffering of innocent people and provoking interconfessional strife are unjustifiable" [40] On the same day, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sent his condolences to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak saying: "It was with a deep sorrow that I learned about the criminal blast near the Christian church in the city of Alexandria on the night of January 1, 2011. Please convey my sincere condolences to the relatives of the victims and my wishes for a fastest recovery to the injured. Strongly condemning the bloody attack of extremists, I wish to assure you that Russia was and will be on the side of Egypt and its people in the uncompromising fight that ensues against the violent challenges of terrorism." [41] Archbishop of Canterbury Dr. Rowan Williams condemned the bombing, declaring that "The New Year's Eve attack on Christians in Alexandria is yet another dreadful reminder of the pressure Christian minorities are under in the Middle East, echoing the atrocities we have seen in recent weeks", in reference to the attack on the church of Our Lady of Salvation in Iraq, carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq.[42]U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the bombing, stating that: "The perpetrators of this attack were clearly targeting Christian worshipers, and have no respect for human life and dignity. They must be brought to justice for this barbaric and heinous act."[43][44] Obama also offered assistance to the Egyptian government in responding to the "terrible event."[43] Canadian minister of foreign affairs Lawrence Cannon issued a statement stating that "Canada condemns this latest vicious attack by extremists against Egypts Coptic community," and offering his sympathy with the families and friends of the victims.[45] The statement also called upon Egypts President Hosni Mubarak to close ranks and confront the terrorists who were behind this deplorable attack.[45]French President Nicolas Sarkozy denounced the "blind and cowardly crime" against Christians in Egypt and expressed his "shock and great sadness". Sarkozy also called upon Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to "find and punish the perpetrators and sponsors of this indiscriminate and cowardly crime."[46][47] On the day of the bombing, French Prime Minister Franois Fillon, who was vacationing in the Upper Egyptian city of Aswan, visited the Coptic Orthodox cathedral in Aswan to pray for the souls of the victims, to express solidarity with the Coptic community and to express France's commitment to defending religious freedom in Egypt and the world.[21][22] In a written statement, French MEP Marine Le Pen lent her support to the Coptic Christians.[48]In Rome, the Italian foreign ministry issued a statement "firmly condemning" the attack and confirming that Italy would "continue to make its voice heard to ensure the full protection of religious freedom in all the circumstances".[46] German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her condolences for "this barbaric act of terror".[28],[49] However, Stefan Mueller, parliamentary leader of the junior coalition party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), called on Angela Merkel to go further, by linking development aid to the treatment of Christians in relevant countries.[28] The High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the European Union Catherine Ashton condemned "unreservedly the attack against innocent Copt worshipers", stating that "there cannot be any justification for this attack" and that "the right of Christian Copts to gather and worship freely must be protected."[50]In Lebanon, Amine Gemayel former President of Lebanon and leader of the Kataeb Party called the crime a "massacre" and a "genocide".Massacres are taking place for no reason and without any justification against Christians. It is only because they are Christians. What is happening to Christians is a genocide.[51] The leader of Lebanon's Progressive Socialist Party Walid Jumblatt also condemned the attack, calling on Egypt to boost the political participation of Christians in state institutions in a bid to counter attempts to spark strife and tamper with civil peace.[51] A spokesman of the Movement of the Future condemned the massacre as a delegation from the movement visited the Coptic church in Beirut to offer their condolences to members of the Coptic community.[51] Maronite Archbishop of Byblos, Bchara al-Raii, also condemned the massacre, and called for a Muslim summit to condemn attacks carried out by radical movements against Christians under the guise of Islam.[51] He also urged the Egyptian government to protect Christians and ensure equal treatment for them.[51] Separate condemnations came from the Sunni Mufti of the Republic Mohammad Qabbani and Deputy Head of the Shiite Supreme Council Abdul Amir Qabalan.[52]In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his "great shock" and reaffirmed his conviction of "the need for a common front by all countries that believe in freedom in the face of terrorism".[46] In Syria, a so-called official source spoke against "such terrorist crimes... (and) expressed ... condolences to Egypt and the families of the innocent victims".[53] Condemnation came as well from the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch and the Orient IgnatiusIV Hazim.[54] PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas also condemned the attacks calling them a "work of the criminal and inhumane, which aims to destabilize security and stability in our sister country Egypt, and to cause tensions between Muslims and Christians".[46] Hamas condemned the bombing in Alexandria, assigning the blame to hidden hands that do not wish well for Egypt and its Muslim and Christian people and seek to inflame sectarian strife. Hamas in its statement sent condolences to Egypt and the victims' families, and hoped that facts would be disclosed the soonest and that those responsible would be brought to justice.[55]The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Fouad Twal called on Christians to show courage in the face of the attack, declaring that "This latest massacre must lead us to reflect on our vocation as Christians in this region, which cannot be allowed to turn its back on the Cross".[39]The attacks were also condemned by the United Kingdom,[56] Iraq,[7] Jordan,[57] Bahrain,[57] Poland,[58] Kuwait,[57] the GCC,[57] Saudi Arabia,[57] Qatar,[59] and Iran.[46][edit] FuneralThe funeral of the victims was held in the Monastery of Saint Mina, about 30km west of Alexandria.[26] Between 5,000 and 10,000 people attended the funeral, all of whom adamantly rejected the condolences of president Hosni Mubarak, shouting "No! No! No!" as bishop Youanis attempted to thank Mubarak for his condolences and his statement regarding the bombing.[21][22][26] They also expressed their anger with the governor of Alexandria who attended the funeral, shouting "Resign!" and "We don't want you!".[13]In addition to Bishop Youanis, Pope Shenouda III delegated Metropolitan Bakhomios to preside over the funeral of those killed in Alexandria.[27][edit] Further threatsIn Europe, Coptic churches have been threatened with further attacks.[28] Coptic bishops and priests in France and Germany filed complaints and called for governmental protection.[28] In the United Kingdom, officials reported that threats were outlined against two Coptic churches in the country.[28]In Canada, Coptic churches were on high alert following threats by Al Qaida against Copts in Canada.[31] All five Coptic churches in Montreal decided to proceed under tightened security with the Eastern Christmas Eve mass on the eve of Eastern Christmas, which falls on January 7th.[30][31]The bombing also raised fears that jihadists would increase violence against Christians worldwide.[60] Radical Islamic hostility to the Copts has been an ongoing problem. A "death list" featuring the names of 200 Copts, many of whom live in Canada and Austria, was recently published on an Al Qaida-affiliated website.[31][61] [62] The website called for the murder of all those whose names appear on the list, accusing them of defaming Islam and converting Muslims to Christianity.[61][62][edit] External linksDaragahi, Borzou (January 1, 2011).
