The attacks killed 168 people. In 2009, Headley traveled to Britain to help plan an attack against a Danish newspaper that had published cartoons of the prophet Muhammad. He was arrested in October 2009 on his way to Pakistan.[10][11]Since his arrest and guilty plea, Headley has been cooperating with U.S. and Indian authorities, and has yielded much information about his associates.[9][12][13][14]There is intense interest in India in Headley's story, as it is the latest discovery in the unfolding saga of the devastating Mumbai attacks of November 26, 2008, known in India as 26/11. U.S. authorities gave Indian investigators direct access to Headley,[15] but there was suspicion in India about why his name was not shared by the United States.[16]Contents1 Early life1.1 Drug conviction and DEA deal1.2 Domestic arrest and terror training1.3 Name change and move to Chicago2 Life with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistani intelligence3 Accusations by FBI, and guilty plea4 Accusations by India's NIA5 Associations with Pakistani serving and ex-military officers6 Association with Lashkar-e-Taiba7 Participation in 2008 Mumbai attacks7.1 Scouting target locations7.2 Visits to India8 Planning for additional attacks in India9 Ease of entry with U.S. passport10 Suspicions in India about U.S. government relationship with Headley11 Domestic criticism of Indian government12 Interrogation of Headley by NIA in the US13 Claims relating to 2010 Pune German Bakery blast14 Review of the handling of Headley by U.S. authorities15 See also16 References17 External links[edit] Early lifeDaood Gilani was born in Washington, D.C., where his father, Sayed Salim Gilani, worked for the Voice of America. His Maryland-born mother, (Alice) Serrill Headley (19392008), worked as a secretary at the Pakistani embassy in Washington at the time of his birth and was the "libertine" daughter of former University of Maryland football star L. Coleman Headley.[17][18] He has a younger sister, Syedah, and half-brother Danyal Gilani, who was formerly the spokesman for the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Yousaf Raza Gillani, and presently serves as Pakistan's press attach in Beijing.[19]When his marriage to his American wife broke up in the mid 1960s and he obtained custody of his children, Sayed Gilani returned to Pakistan, along with his son and daughter.[18] There Daood attended the Cadet College Hasan Abdal, a preparatory boys' high school for the military. In 1977, after the Pakistani government was overthrown in a coup, Serrill Headley traveled to Pakistan and brought him to live with her in the United States, where he grew up over the bar she owned in Philadelphia, Khyber Pass.[18][20][21] In 1985 Gilani married a Pennsylvania State University student, but they divorced in 1987 due to cultural conflicts.[22][edit] Drug conviction and DEA dealGilani opened two video rental stores in New York City in the late 1980s.[23]In 1987 he was first arrested on drug charges, and cooperated with the DEA in exchange for a lighter sentence.[24]In 1997 he was one of two men arrested for smuggling heroin into the country from Pakistan.[20] In exchange for information about his Pakistani drug contacts, he received a considerably lighter sentence than his co-defendant: fifteen months in jail and five years of supervised release. In November 1998, Headley was delivered to the low-security Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix. However, his supervised release period was never completed. Instead, in November 2001, an assistant U.S. attorney applied to have Headley discharged.[25] Headley traveled to Pakistan multiple times to conduct undercover surveillance operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration.[10][20] In 2002 and three times in 2003, he attended Lashkar-e-Taiba training camps in Pakistan.[22][edit] Domestic arrest and terror trainingGilani's 1999 trip to Pakistan was for an arranged marriage, but in 2002, he married his girlfriend of 8 years in New York.[26] In August 2005 Gilani was arrested in New York after a fight with his then wife.[26] His wife told federal agents that Gilani was an active member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, had trained extensively in its Pakistani camps, and had shopped for night-vision goggles and other equipment.Gilani trained five times with Lashkar-e-Taiba at a camp in Pakistan. A 2007 court testimony by a fellow militant Willie Brigitte described the Lashkar training camp, which was guarded and supplied by Pakistan army soldiers.[3]In October 2010, when it was revealed that Headley's wives had complained in 2005 and in 2007 to U.S. authorities about his terrorist activities to no effect, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper, Jr. undertook a review of how Headley had been handled.[11][edit] Name change and move to ChicagoIn 2006, he changed his name to David Headley so as to make border crossings between the United States and other countries easier. He moved his family to Chicago, where he claimed to work for Tahawwur Hussain Rana's immigration agency. Rana had been in the Cadet College Hasan Abdal with him.[20][edit] Life with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistani intelligenceHeadley visited his family home in Lahore in 2000. While there, he befriended Lashkar's spiritual leader, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, whose ideology he came to embrace.Pakistan officially outlawed Lashkar in 2002, but after that and through 2005, Headley did five stints at Lashkar terror camps where officers of the ISI and the Pakistani army helped provide arms, screening and training. Lashkar assigned him to work with a militant chief named Sajid Mir, also known as Sajid Majid, who allegedly became a lead plotter of the Mumbai attacks. Western investigators say that Mir had close ties to the ISI and may be a former military or intelligence officer.[2]An ISI brigadier general served as handler for Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi, Lashkar's military chief, while the ISI funds Lashkar and shields Saeed, the spiritual leader, from interference, Headley said.All of Headley's accusations against the ISI have been denied by unnamed Pakistani officials.[2]In January 2006, an ISI officer named Major Samir Ali interviewed Headley, then referred him to a Major Iqbal, who became his main handler in Lahore. Major Iqbal, described as fat, deep-voiced and in his mid-thirties, introduced Headley to a man identified as Lieutenant Colonel Shah, who promised Headley financial support for terrorist operations against India.At subsequent meetings in safe houses, Major Iqbal gave Headley secret documents on India. He assigned a non-commissioned officer to give the American standard intelligence training. Headley learned techniques for detecting surveillance, developing sources and other skills, then practiced with the lower-ranking officer on the streets of Lahore. The specialized training lasted several months and continued intermittently afterward as Major Iqbal taught Headley how to use cameras and other devices for missions.Headley said Major Iqbal gave him $25,000 to set up a front company in Mumbai as a cover while conducting reconnaissance for the attacks. Headley spent months scouting the Taj Mahal hotel and other targets for Mir and Major Iqbal, who also sent him on separate missions to gather intelligence on an atomic research center and military sites around India. Major Iqbal contributed advice about tactical issues to the Mumbai plot: escape routes for the gunmen, setting up a safe house, hijacking an Indian vessel at sea. Headley said the major approved of Mir's decision to attack Western targets such as the Chabad House Jewish center directed by an American rabbi.[edit] Accusations by FBI, and guilty pleaThe cartoons of Muhammad, as published in Jyllands-Posten in September 2005, which made it a target for Islamic terrorists.David Coleman Headley, 48, and Tahawwur Hussain Rana, 48, were accused by U.S. federal authorities in Chicago, in complaints unsealed on October 27, 2009, of plotting against the employees of a newspaper in Copenhagen.[27] Headley is accused of traveling to Denmark to scout the building of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, and a nearby Synagogue, for an attack by terrorists.[28]On December 8, 2009, the FBI additionally accused Headley of conspiring to bomb targets in Mumbai, India; providing material support to Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant Pakistani Islamist group; and aiding and abetting the murder of U.S. citizens in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.[4]Headley pleaded guilty to all charges on March 18, 2010.[1][29] He faces life in prison and a three million dollar fine when he is sentenced.[30][edit] Accusations by India's NIAIndia's new National Investigation Agency (NIA) registered a case against Headley and Rana for allegedly plotting the 2008 Mumbai attacks in India.[31][32] After having interrogated Headley in Chicago for a week, the NIA has requested a Delhi court to issue non-bailable warrants to arrest Headley and others.[14]Headley's arrest and guilty plea got close media attention in India, with the Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram addressing it in frequent questions from reporters. Chidambaram said the United States authorities have shared "significant information" about the case. U.S. assistant secretary of state Robert O. Blake, Jr. said India would have "full access" to question Headley in the United States, although the possibility of extraditing him to India appears to be precluded by Headley's plea agreement.[33][34] Chidambaram said they would continue to try to get the man extradited.[35]Headley's admissions, e.g., that he made video recordings of terrorism targets for the LeT, have corroborated other evidence in the ongoing trial of Ajmal Amir Kasab in Mumbai.[36]A classified Indian report, based on Headley's interrogation by Indian investigators in Chicago, concludes that some of Headley's scouting trips to Mumbai were financed and planned by the ISI.[11] When this report was leaked to U.S. media in October 2010, its conclusions were denied by Pakistani authorities.[edit] Associations with Pakistani serving and ex-military officersBoth Headley and Rana are accused in the FBI complaints of reporting to Ilyas Kashmiri, an Islamist militant commander associated with both Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba.[27] Kashmiri is reported by many sources to be a former Pakistani military commando,[27][37][38] although he denied this in an interview in October 2009.[39] Headley made contact with the al-Qaeda member when he made two trips to North Waziristan, in FATA (a tribal area under limited central government authority).[40]Another former military officer is suspected as a co-conspirator and identified only by a pseudonym (Individual A) in the first FBI complaint against Headley. He is said to have recently left the Pakistani Army as a Colonel or Brigadier.[27] This second officer, suspected in the complaint as affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, was arrested in 2009 in Pakistan on unspecified charges and later released.[27] He was identified by the FBI in December 2009 as Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed.[4] Abdur Rehman, also known as "Pasha", is also wanted by the FBI.[41]An Associated Press story on November 24, 2009 said that five Pakistan army officers, including a retired brigadier and two active lieutenant colonels, had been detained for questioning in Pakistan.[42] They had all been in telephone contact with Headley. But the next day, Pakistan military spokesman Athar Abbas said that "security agencies" had only detained a single former army major in connection with the FBI case.[43][44][45]Separately, Headley told Indian investigators in June 2010 that his trip to Mumbai in 2006 was sponsored by a Pakistani officer of the ISI. This officer, named Maj. Iqbal, handed Mr. Headley $25,000 to open an office and set up a house in Mumbai to be used as a front during his scouting trips. Maj. Iqbal served as the supervisor of Lashkars planning, helping to arrange a communications system for the attack, and overseeing a model of the Taj Mahal Hotel, so that gunmen could find their way around.[46]The FBI investigation into the 2008 Mumbai attacks focuses on Major Iqbal and Sajid Mir, who are both suspected of being Headley's handlers for Pakistani intelligence. They instructed him to use the money to open a front company and begin reconnaissance in Mumbai.[3][edit] Association with Lashkar-e-TaibaAnother individual named in the complaint as "LeT member A", a member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, gave instructions to Headley on which locations to scout for future attacks, including both the Danish newspaper and locations in India,[6] such as the National Defense College in New Delhi. Indian intelligence officials believe that LeT member A is Sajid Mir,[47] Lashkar's head of international operations.[48] Sajid Mir was a ranking member of the Pakistani army until several years ago,[48] and attended the same military high school, with Headley and Rana.[48]Court documents allege that Headley corresponded with the Lashkar-e-Taiba associates in coded messages about the Mickey Mouse Project, code for the plot against the Danish newspaper. After his visit to Denmark in 2009, Headley allegedly traveled to Pakistan to meet with the LeT associate. After his arrest in October 2009, Headley told federal agents that he received training from LeT.[49][edit] Participation in 2008 Mumbai attacks[edit] Scouting target locationsHeadley traveled five times to India to scout locations for terrorist attacks on behalf of Lashkar-e-Taiba. He revealed that Major Iqbal has given him $25,000 to setup a front company to do reconaissance for the Mumbai attacks.[50] During his visits to Mumbai, he gathered video footage and GPS coordinates. After each visit, Headley returned to Pakistan and provided Lashkar operatives with videotapes of the potential targets and seaborne landing locations nearby. This information was used to execute the 2008 Mumbai attacks.[47][51][edit] Visits to IndiaFront view of Nariman House,a week after the attacksHeadley's visits to India on a business visa were ostensibly to set up an office for First World Services, an immigration agency belonging to Rana. Headley posed as a Jew to scout the Jewish center at Nariman House for attack.[52] Headley made multiple visits to India before and after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, while Rana visited it only once.[53]A Moroccan woman, Faiza Outalha, believed to be Headley's wife, visited India twice: in 2007 she flew to Mumbai from Karachi and stayed with Headley in the Taj Mahal Hotel and the Oberoi Trident, both of which were targets in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. In 2008 she crossed from Pakistan via the road at Wagah and spent time in Manali.[49][54] They later divorced.[edit] Planning for additional attacks in IndiaIn March 2009, Headley made another trip to India to conduct surveillance of the National Defence College in Delhi, and of Chabad Houses in various cities in India.[33][edit] Ease of entry with U.S. passportIndian investigators were surprised at how easily Headley had obtained a visa to enter India, a process that is extremely difficult for Pakistani nationals. Headley's U.S. passport, his new Christian sounding name, and the fact that the passport and his visa application made no mention of his prior name or his father's nationality, made it easy for him to obtain an Indian visa from the Indian consulate in Chicago. He also falsely stated on his visa application that his father's name was William Headley and that his own name at birth was "Headley", a claim that was difficult to refute since the U.S. passport, unlike the Indian one, does not provide the father's name, and does not require endorsements on name changes by the passport holder.[55] Indian government officials said that if the name change been noted on his passport, Indian immigration officials would have been alerted during his multiple visits to India.[7]On his visits to India, Headley befriended several people, including Rahul Bhatt, the son of a famous movie producer Mahesh Bhatt,[56] who said he never suspected Headley of any wrongdoing.[56][edit] Suspicions in India about U.S. government relationship with HeadleyWhile government officials in India cite full cooperation by U.S. authorities, the opposition parties and others in India have demanded explanations of why Headley was allowed to travel freely for years between India, Pakistan, and the U.S., and why he was working undercover for the DEA. Some Indian analysts have speculated that David Headley was a CIA Double agent within LeT,[57] an accusation denied by the CIA.[58] As soon as Headley was arrested in Chicago, the Indian media had a barrage of questions for the government about him, whose answers were slow in coming. Among other questions, Indian investigators wanted the FBI to share its tapes of Headley's communications with his Pakistani handlers to match with the voices taped on cell phones during the 2008 Mumbai attacks.[59]Following intense coverage and speculation in the Indian press, U.S. ambassador Timothy J. Roemer told reporters in New Delhi that the United States is working at the "highest level" to provide India access to Headley, even as it is passing along answers to questions in "real time".[60]News reports in October 2010 revealed that U.S. authorities had plenty of advance knowledge about David Headley's terrorist associations and activities. Headley's American and Moroccan wives had contacted American authorities in 2005 and 2007, respectively, complaining about his terrorist activities. The Moroccan wife told reporters that she had even shown the U.S. embassy in Islamabad photographs of their stay at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, warning them that he was doing something on behalf of Lashkar-e-Taiba.[46][edit] Domestic criticism of Indian governmentSince Headley's guilty plea, Home Minister P. Chidambaram was repeatedly asked why the U.S. cannot extradite Headley to India. Analysts in some media outlets have speculated that the United States conspired to have Headley work undercover despite knowledge that he was involved in terrorism.[61][62][edit] Interrogation of Headley by NIA in the USIn June 2010, US National Security Adviser James Jones announced that India's National Investigation Agency(NIA) has been given access to Headley.[63]The investigation has confirmed that Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists carried out the Mumbai attack under the "guidance" of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence(ISI). He stated that the ISI was engaged with the Lashkar commanders responsible for the Mumbai carnage at each and every stage of the plot.Further, Headley mentioned that Major Sameer Ali, Major Iqbal and Major Haroon, who are serving officers of Pakistan army, collaborated with the LeT.Headley has also spoken of how post-26/11, ISI wanted LeT to disown the Mumbai attack in order to prevent global attention to the terror group, which Pakistan considers to be an important strategic asset to be used against India. With Ajmal Kasab was the only terrorist captured, ISI wanted to blame the terrorist act on al-Qaida. It even prepared a list of 4-5 al-Qaida figures who were to be projected as the conspirators. The plan, however, did not work due to resitance from Lashkar leaders, particularly Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi.Headley also admitted that while he had started off as a Lashkar recruit, he started drifting towards Al Qaida under the influence of Major Abdul Rahman Saeed, who retired in 2002. Headley went high in the retired major's list because of precise inputs Headley provided for the 26/11 attack.Saeed, with the help of Ilyas Kashmiri, drafted him for the plan to attack Danish newspaper Jylland Posten which published controversial cartoons of Prophet Mohammad. This, when Headley's original handler Sajid Mir wanted him to focus on Lashkar's anti-India mission. [64]Headley claimed that Ishrat Jahan, thought to be a case of fake encounter, was a trained L-e-T suicide bomber.[65][edit] Claims relating to 2010 Pune German Bakery blastIn relation to the 2010 Pune blast at the German bakery that killed 15[66] people out of which 4 were foreigners and injured at least 53 people, Indian Home Secretary, G. K. Pillai[67] and the Hindustan Times[68] referred to Headley. The Hindustan Times stated that Headley had visited Pune in July 2008 and March 2009 and referred to him as a Lashkar-e-Taiba member.[68] The Hindustan Times also reported that the CCTV footage which has been accessed by the Investigating agency, can, as per The Hindustan Times, help solve the mystery. The Times of India has also reported similar reports, along with The Telegraph, The Hindu, The Pioneer and also Indian Express.[edit] Review of the handling of Headley by U.S. authoritiesThe United States Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. conducted a review of slip-ups in handling Headley's involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. His report was shared with India's Union Home Ministry.[69][edit] See alsoMichael Finton, American convert to Islam, attempted September 2009 bombing of U.S. target with FBI agent he thought was al-Qaeda memberSharif Mobley, American suspected al-Qaeda member, arrested in Yemen in 2010 and suspected of killing guard in escape attemptFaisal Shahzad, Muslim Pakistani-American who confessed to the 2010 Times Square car bomb attemptAafia Siddiqui, alleged al-Qaeda member, former U.S. resident, convicted in 2010 of attempting to kill U.S. personnelBryant Neal Vinas, American convert to Islam, convicted in 2009 of participating in/supporting Al-Qaeda plots in Afghanistan and the U.S.Najibullah Zazi, al-Qaeda member, U.S. resident, pleaded guilty in 2010 of planning suicide bombings on New York City subway systemDetention of five Americans in Pakistan (Dec. 2009)[edit] References^ a b "Terror suspect likely to change plea".
