Her mother spent $200 getting Vapor King e-cigarettes for her to help her to get off the real thing.  She loved them with all the flavors and the feel of them with all of the vapor being inhaled and looking like smoke.  These ones had 18 mg of nicotine per cartridge.  Just last week she was so happy with them and how they freed her from cigarettes.Suddenly this week she no longer wants them.  She wants cigarettes and she got a pack on Monday and smoked the entire pack in a day.  Before she got these last e-cigarettes she had cut herself down to just a couple of cigarettes a day along with using nicotine gum.  This Monday she was not interested in either the e-cigarettes or nicotine gum.So if she is getting the nicotine, the drug to which she is addicted, from either the e-cigarettes or nicotine gum I don't understand why she would reject them in favor of tobacco cigarettes with all of their downside and social stigma.  Is there something more going on about smoking other than the nicotine because with an e-cigarette she is not only getting the nicotine, but also the actual feel of a cigarette as well as inhaling?Help me to understand better what this is all about.Refresh|0 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadI am a former smokerlillypaddleJan-06-11 07:51 PM#1But she is getting nicotine with the e-cigarette or the nicotine gum.elocsJan-06-11 08:10 PM#4That is it -- when you quit you are no longer 'regulating' your emotionsastralJan-06-11 11:52 PM#15Personally, I love the taste of burning, bubbling tar going down my throatmany a good manJan-06-11 08:05 PM#2Just what is it that e-cigs are missing that they don't provide as much satisfaction as real cigs?elocsJan-06-11 08:16 PM#5Smoking is MORE than pure nicotine addictionmany a good manJan-06-11 08:26 PM#6I know one of the things, perhaps the biggest that is driving her to smoke,elocsJan-06-11 08:40 PM#7Coping strategies. many a good manJan-06-11 09:45 PM#10Oh, that is a BIG one.WithywindleJan-06-11 11:57 PM#16Yes, it is a big one but her schizophrenia is well medicated and under control.elocsJan-07-11 12:45 AM#20My guess would be a lot of people who have clinical depression smoke, or used to.raccoonJan-07-11 09:13 AM#25Smokers usually stick to their brand.

Smokers unconsciously adjust their inhaling to accomodate their need.  In other words, if nervous or upset, they take quick, frequent hits.  After a fine meal (or sex   they inhale slowly, taking long breaths of the nicotine.  It is a relaxant, a stimulant, and everything in between.  Nicotine taken in through the lungs hits the pleasure center of the brain like crack cocaine.  It is insideous in its ability to hook you.I have smoked since I was 17 (63 now) - I quit last September when I was diagnosed with chronic bronchitis - COPD - and the only reason I still don't smoke is that it sends me into gales of coughing.  I use nicotine gum, because it satisfies that oral thing - I can use it after a meal, like I would have used a cigarette. Theoretically, the patch is great, in that it delivers nicotine slowly and consistently (although I had really trippy dreams that totally screwed up my sleeping/rest), but I missed the oral part. Regardless, it is more than the nicotine addiction that a smoker has to fight.  It's the IMMEDIATE hit of nicotine to the brain that gum or patches can't provide.  I haven't tried the e-cigarette, because I'm thinking with my chronic bronchitis, it wouldn't be a good idea to have moisture and nicotine hit my lungs.Cigarettes stink, they make the smoker stink, they stain teeth, ruin your lungs, and cause damage to your clothes -- but by god, I loved smoking, and I miss it.  It's difficult to explain addiction.  Chances are that logic won't do any good until your goddaughter is ready.  I hope she is ready before she does some really serious damage to herself.Best to her, and to you.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topelocs      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 08:10 PMResponse to Reply #14.But she is getting nicotine with the e-cigarette or the nicotine gum.What more is it about smoking an actual tobacco cigarette might it be that she is craving that would cause her to reject either the e-cigarette or the nicotine gum out of hand?The stink part is right because now I can smell the cigarette smoke on her from even a distance.

I remember feeling like an emotional basketcase.  I could start crying and not be able to stop without EVEN knowing why.  So I'd give up on trying to quit over and over and over again until finally, I stopped and stayed stopped.  This was over a six-year period where I'd sometimes get up to 7 or 9 months at a stretch of staying quitted.Not everyone faces the same level of addiction, but for an awful lot of us there is nothing harder to do in this universe than to give up smoking.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmany a good man      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 08:05 PMResponse to Original message2.Personally, I love the taste of burning, bubbling tar going down my throatEverybody's unique, and each has different combination of reasons why they smoke. These include, but are not limited to, the following:* The consumption. Sucking down your favorite smoke is like eating or drinking your favorite thing.* The smoke thing. The curling wisps are mesmerizing and the source of immense enjoyment. * The hand thing. Withdrawal starts as soon as you put out the last butt. You become a little antsy and your hands want to do something. * Boredom. It's a great excuse to do something different than what you're doing now. * The social aspect. The most sociable creatures on the planet are smokers and the rest of you bore us to tears. Smoking is a great excuse to get away, go out, and be among the interesting people. * The anti-social aspect. Deep down we are sorely disappointed in the human race, and it brings us immense pleasure to piss off you self-righteous losers. * Rebellion. Social norms as a whole are infuriating and smoking is our only little way striking back against everything. * Pure addiction. We are weak-willed and unwilling to go thru the few days or weeks of intense agony to rid ourselves of a disgusting, filthy, harmful habit. I, too, have quit and failed. E-cigs are the closest to the real thing in that they are capable of somewhat satisfying many of the above reasons for smoking. But they are not quite there yet. The technology is not quite good enough. You really gotta wanta quit bad.

Another, more troubling, aspect I didn't list is SELF-LOATHING and SELF-DESTRUCTION. Smoking is a form of slow suicide. Some of us also have a core distaste for life. We are too chicken to off ourselves immediately, but killing ourselves slowly some how satisfies this desire. You would have to get VERY close to her to see if this is actually what is driving her to smoke.

Research believes they smoke because the nicotine helps their thought process, helping them to concentrate and to think more straight.  Her psychiatrist has told me that entire books have been written about schizophrenics and smoking.  So I know there is more going on than with your average smoker and I actually expected that the e-cigs would be a replacement for smoking tobacco cigarettes so she could get the nicotine she needs without all of the other bad and cancerous stuff in cigarettes.  But apparently there is more going on than just nicotine and its replacement.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topmany a good man      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 09:45 PMResponse to Reply #710.Coping strategies. I'm truly sorry to hear that, but remember, there are things worse than smoking. I think you're right, though. Maybe a nicotine substitute in combination with some other therapies would be effective.

It's not *just* a matter of nicotine's effects on the brain, or the ritualistic behavior of smoking, or the pleasure one comes to associate with the taste...it involves all of the above.I'm going to go out on a limb and say that her schizophrenia is a MUCH more immediate concern than her smoking, if she's only 19 - the longterm effects of the latter won't hit her for years yet, but she's feeling the pain of the former right now. I admire her for trying, but frankly, I think going through the VERY painful longterm process of withdrawal and recovery might very well be totally beyond a teenager with a much more serious illness. Definitely encourage her to quit if she really truly wants to, but please please don't get angry with her if she fails - that won't help one little bit.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topelocs      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 12:45 AMResponse to Reply #1620.Yes, it is a big one but her schizophrenia is well medicated and under control.She sees a counselor every week and her psychiatrist every 6 weeks, plus I am here to watch over her.  She is in a very good situation compared with many other people with a mental disease, but like very many of them that do smoke, her pack a day addiction was eating up a big chunk of her monthly SSI.  She may not be suffering any longterm effects of smoking but I have heard her in the middle of the night coughing like she was going to bring up a lung.I had hoped that nicotine replacement using the e-cigarettes would be enough to help her not only over the addictive aspect of smoking cigarettes, but having the nicotine would continue to help her thought process. My expectation was that she would not be off of nicotine anytime soon but getting it in the form other than from tobacco would relieve the ill effects of smoking cigarettes.This is why I asked the original question of my OP about what it is all about with smoking because it must be more than the nicotine or even the feel and routine of a cigarette because the e-cigs seem to mimic that well although not perfectly.  She is holding something that looks and has the physical appearance of a cigarette.  The end glows when she takes a drag and she is drawing vapor into her lungs that contains nicotine.  Something else seems to be going on and it may be something that is not common to all smokers.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topraccoon      (1000+ posts)Fri Jan-07-11 09:13 AMResponse to Reply #725.My guess would be a lot of people who have clinical depression smoke, or used to.Never heard that about schizophrenics and smoking....interesting.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topseaglass      (1000+ posts)      Thu Jan-06-11 09:14 PMResponse to Reply #58.Smokers usually stick to their brand.

She even commented that she would be interested in selling them.This same pattern occurred a year ago when she first got e-cigarettes for Christmas in 2009.  She was very excited at first and then she didn't use them much claiming she needed a new battery although even after she got the new battery she still would not use them much.  Next thing you know she is up to smoking a pack a day and then claiming the e-cigarettes were not the kind she wanted.  Then again for Christmas this year her mom got her the exact kind of e-cigarettes that she said she wanted, but her interest in them only lasted a few weeks.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopLucinda      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 12:37 AMResponse to Reply #1819.That would make me crazy (er)You'd think that SOMETHING was the catalyst for the flaky behavior...I can't even begin to think of a likely reason.

Maybe she got tired of having to deal with all the intricacies of using the e-cig.  It also isn't going to feel the same, look the same, taste the same, etc., etc.  And as far as I can tell, there's no way to know when you're "done" (with regular cigs, you're "done" when it burns down to the filter).  Smokers don't even like having to use a different BRAND of cigarette, and switching brands takes a lot of getting used to.  It took me ages to get used to the differences with the "fire safe" cigs in how they taste and how they burn, and for months I HATED them and searched everywhere for any place still selling the regular ones yet it was nothing like switching to a completely different brand, which would have been a hell of a lot more difficult to deal with.  There's also being able to tell when you need more at a glance and how long they'll last.  That's another thing that scares me about using e-cigs... how will I know at a glance when I'm "out"?  I get a really bad panicy feeling when I only have one pack left and know I need to go buy more.  There's times when I've gotten down to just a few cigs without having bought more, and that panicy feeling REALLY escalates.  I can't even imagine having NONE around.   Personally, there's a hell of a lot more to my addiction that nicotine has nothing at all to do with.  It's the entire ritual.  It's almost like an OCD thing.There very well could be something to her not getting as much nicotine as she did with regular cigs.  Though each cartridge has X amount of mgs., one cartridge doesn't equal one cig, so though she may be "smoking" as much as she used to, she may not be getting anything near the same amount of nicotine as she used to PER "smoke".  Have you considered just ASKING her what it is about the e-cigs she doesn't like?Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topelocs      (1000+ posts)      Sat Jan-08-11 11:39 AMResponse to Reply #3536.I did ask her.She does not dislike the e-cigs.  In fact for the first couple of weeks she could not say enough good about them, about all the different flavors and about how she did not have to go outside as much.  She has lots of cartridges, so she was in no danger of running out, but she did have to keep them charged and she has difficulty even in keeping her cell phone charged.But now, even after she has e-cigs that are charged she won't use them.  I have wondered about the nicotine level aspect of e-cigs and how much you get per puff on average compared to a tobacco cigarette.  The ones she currently has have 18 mg of nicotine per cartridge while the ones she had a earlier last year only had 6 mg of nicotine per cartridge.  A cartridge is supposed to be equivalent to about a pack of cigarettes so if she smoked a pack a day it would be a cartridge a day.  My guess is that since the cartridge is actually equivalent to many cigarettes that her tendency was to continue smoking more than she would have if she had to light another cigarette each time.  So there are questions about the specific aspects concerning e-cigs such as the amount of nicotine per puff or cigarette equivalent of puffs and if e-cig users actually smoke more than they would using tobacco cigarettes.I understand the ritual thing.  To a nonsmoker many of the rituals involved in using e-cigs are like regular cigarettes, although some are obviously different.  In the end I'm beginning to see that quitting the use of tobacco cigarettes is more complicated than just the nicotine replace or even the ritual.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopWithywindle      (1000+ posts)Thu Jan-06-11 11:51 PMResponse to Reply #214.As a smoker, I think you nailed itParticularly the fact that there are many, many different reasons that go into it. Smoking addiction is every bit as complicated as alcoholism or eating disorders or a gambling addiction or every other kind of addictive behavior that affects every area of life, from the pleasure centers in the brain to social life to one's fundamental (and not always conscious) beliefs about the world.What I think a lot of non-smokers who hate the smell just don't get is how incredibly pleasurable it is to a smoker. And how much the "little pleasures" mean to someone who is hurting or lacking in other sources of joy.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopBertha Venation      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 02:07 PMResponse to Reply #1430.your last para -- I think that's why my MIL smokesOutwardly, there seems to be little joy in her life.

The e-cigs.  Maybe then I can finally get away from the damn things.

That's all you really need to know.Other than smoking makes you look totally cool, that is...lol.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topelocs      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 02:24 PMResponse to Reply #2931.Addiction is certainly a big part, but something else is also going on here.Here is an article in Newsweek that my goddaughter's counselor recommended to her today:  http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/03/can-you-build-a-bett... Here's an interesting part:By nailing down the underpinnings of cognition, neuroscientists can separate plausible brain boosters from dubious ones. With apologies to the political-correctness police, nicotine enhances attentionthat key driver of neuroplasticityand cognitive performance in both smokers and nonsmokers, scientists at the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported in a 2010 analysis of 41 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Nicotine, they found, has significant positive effects on fine motor skills, the accuracy of short-term memory, some forms of attention, and working memory, among other basic cognitive skills. The improvements likely represent true performance enhancement and beneficial cognitive effects. The reason is that nicotine binds to the brain receptors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that are central players in cortical circuits. (Caveat: smoking also increases your risk of dementia, so while cigarettes may boost your memory and attention now, you could pay for it later. To be determined: whether a nicotine patch delivers the benefits without the risks.This goes a long way to explaining why a schizophrenic would self medicate by smoking because it helps them to think better (my goddaughter does have memory problems which sucks when you are trying to work and go to school).  Maybe the trouble with using the e-cigs or nicotine gum is in the last line which says it has not been determined if nicotine substitutes deliver the same benefits as smoking when it comes to cognition.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topsinkingfeeling      (1000+ posts)      Fri Jan-07-11 02:33 PMResponse to Original message32.I smoked for over 40 years and stopped 'cold turkey' on the day I went in forsurgery to remove cancer from my tonsils (although I didn't know it was cancer at the time). One would have thought I'd have been addicted to the nicotine if anybody was ever going to be, but I had absolutely no craving for it.I missed doing something. I missed the smell and will still inhale deeply when I pass a burning cigarette for the aroma. I haven't had a cigarette in 720 days, but still feel deprived of the act of smoking.

That means you would have to smoke an e-cigarette twice as long to get the same nicotine hit as from a tobacco cigarette.  Maybe she is missing the strength of nicotine in each drag of the cigarette.From reading comments on e-cigarettes the praise of them is effusive from former smokers who say they helped them to quit smoking.  One this is certain, smoking is a very expensive habit for those who cannot afford it.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDU AdBot (1000+ posts)     Sun Jan 09th 2011, 10:51 PM      Response to Original messageAdvertisements [?]Top Big Forums |-- Latest Breaking News |-- Editorials & Other Articles |-- Political Videos |-- General Discussion |-- General Discussion: Presidency |-- The DU Lounge |-- Ask the Administrators Forum Categories |-- Topic Forums |-- Places |-- DU Groups |-- Archives My ForumsHomeDiscuss The DU LoungePowered by DCForum+ Version 1.1 Copyright 1997-2002 DCScripts.comSoftware has been extensively modified by the DU administratorsImportant Notices: By participating on this discussion   board, visitors agree to abide by the rules outlined on our Rules   page.
