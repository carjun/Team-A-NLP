The budget cut includes scrapping some programs such as $14bn amphibious fighting vehicles.  Most of the $178bn defence cuts will be implemented through reducing administrative costs, administrative and organizational reshuffling, and through reduced personnel costs. The Defense Department described these plans as a "vigorous scrub of bureaucratic structures."  The Pentagon's budget is expected to be $553bn in 2012, which roughly reflects 3% growth from the year 2011. Growth will slow in the following years, essentially becoming flat in 2015 and 2016, according a statement by the Pentagon. "This is the latest Pentagon acknowledgement that it can't be exempt from the need to make savings to cut the US government deficit," said Nick Childs, the BBC defence and security correspondent. "But there will still be major upheavals for the US armed forces after the years of massive spending increases, and they come at a time when Washington feels its relative military strength is being challenged by emerging powers like China." The defense cut announced by Mr Gates envisions eliminating more than 100 general and flag officer positions, more than 200 top civilian defense positions, reduced administrative costs, and scrapping defense programs deemed reduntant. The savings, Mr Gates said, would be redirected to other programs such as shipbuilding, missile defence, intelligence, reconnaissance, and healthcare for wounded soldiers.  Among the programs which are going to be scrapped are the amphibious Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV), made by General Dynamics Corporation, and the Army's surface-to-air missile program. Mr Gates also announced that the orders for the fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter would be cut over the next three to five years to compensate for the delays in testing and development.  Analysts say the major weapons program cuts are likely to encounter fierce opposition from U.S. congressmen and senators in whose constituencies the arms are manufactured. "I'm not happy," House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard McKeon told reporters, indicating that the cuts were bigger than the defense companies had been expecting.         1 of 31         Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm.

Reply  Reply By     Benjamin Burton Jr.|2 daysagoI agree. Not only in terms of the larger national budget deficit but also as regards military spending. Let's see, here...$78bn over five years, minus a $13+tril national deficit and factor in a projected $550bn+ defense budget and you get squat diddly in terms of real savings.            Reply  Reply By     arslanj|3 daysagoAbsolutely, but it is a good thing that even THEY -- I mean, the top defense officials -- are realizing that the U.S. defense budget is too big and bureaucratic.            Reply  Posted By     Sherrill Fulghum|2 daysagoAnd while they are cutting MORE jobs in the US, and trying to cut the number of military personnel at the first incident Congress, the Department of Defense, and American citizens will be SCREAMING bloody murder about why we weren't protected.I know one way that the military can save a lot of money...plan travel better!!!!My brother was recently deployed. He traveled from Washington state to Maine, to Germany, to Kuwait. After a week he went to Iraq, BUT was sent to the wrong location and had to wait another two weeks before he could be transported to his proper location. I wonder how much money was wasted on that trip?            Reply  Reply By     Hardy Wright|2 daysagoProbably nothing was wasted but time, since they probably sent him standby, utilizing preexisting flights, but time is valuable as well...            Reply  Reply By     Sherrill Fulghum|2 daysagoNo he flew with about 100 other guys to Kuwait, and yeah he DID waste a lot of time; time he could have been there for the birth of his first grandchild, his son's championship football game, and all star game.The military could save a good bit of money if they PLANNED their travel better, even on standby SOMEBODY is paying for the tickets...like Uncle Sam - our tax dollars at work.             Reply By     Sherrill Fulghum|2 daysagoEven if it is a designated military flight, going from Wash, to Maine, to Germany, to Kuwait is a BIG waste of money on fuel and that stuff is EXPENSIVE!!! There has to be a shorter route. And that was just ONE flight; think how much money is wasted over the course of a year!!!             Reply By     Hardy Wright|2 daysagoI agree with you, but they usually send their personnel on military flights that are already set up; that's why they go all over the place; there aren't any tickets, and they don't pay any fare; they just have to figure out which flights will eventually get them to where they want to go... it is an incredible waste of time.            Reply  Reply By     arslanj|2 daysagoThat is an interesting observation Sherrill Fulghum. Interesting, my graduate student colleague who is an Army officer and traveled to Bosnia, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and other places has told me exactly the same thing.            Reply  Posted By     aliphilic|2 daysagogood reporting.... rated up.....            Reply  Posted By     Chaitanya divili|2 daysagoA very good decision by U.S.Defense Department. Military budget now can be transferred to other departments for enhancing internal welfare activities and to over come growing unemployment too.            Reply  Reply By     arslanj|2 daysagoThat's true. But I am hoping this is just the first step in trimming this gigantic budget.            Reply  Posted By     Karl Gotthardt|2 daysagoarslanj this is an excellent report. In the Washington Post story this morning they mention that the cuts will also involve the reduction of U.S. Army and Marine Corps Active Duty Personnel.Army must trim the number of soldiers on active duty by 27,000 and the Marines by 15,000 to 20,000.The production of the F-35 Stealth Fighter Program has also been delayed.It is a step in the right direction and also appears to have bipartisan support. Senator McCain has some concerns about it, but has not rejected it outright.            Reply  Reply By     arslanj|2 daysagoThanks for commenting, Karl. The good thing is that someone (I mean Gates and his associates) finally decided to go forward with this. I am sure, there will be opposition but Gates et al. need to remain firm.            Reply  Posted By     Sherrill Fulghum|2 daysagoThe best way to cut the budget ts to bring ALL of the troops home to protect America and let the rest of the world mind its OWN affairs!And as for those jobs you are looking for...every program that get cut means jobs LOST. If the program is cut (building fighters, etc.) then they don't need to people to build them; ie no equipment, no jobs.            Reply  Posted By     Hardy Wright|2 daysagoIt's important to realize that if/when the US dollar loses it's place as the world's reserve currency, and nobody is forced to buy them any longer, everything will change and become much more problematic, bringing hyperinflation and greatly increased unemployment, which is currently considerably worse than is being reported, since it's based on unemployment claims and those who are no longer receiving benefits but are still unemployed aren't counted.Because we're the reserve currency, we can pay our bills by printing more money, which is, unfortunately, like paying your credit card payment using the same credit card, but it gets them off your back...Should that status change, our money will no longer be honored, and our economy will crash with a boom that will make the Great Depression look like a walk in the park... dark days are ahead if we don't make major changes...            Reply  Posted By     Punditty|1 dayagoAnother step on the road to the privatization of the military, or a step in the right direction?            Reply  Posted By     itobin53|1 dayagoWell it's about time. The pentagon wastes more money than any other govt. agency.
