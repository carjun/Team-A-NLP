OK, true story, just now...I locked myself out of my hotel room. Naked.I'm staying in a 'casita' at a Palm Springs resort.It takes a card key to get into the private patio AND to get into your room from the patio.I went out to the patio for a middle of the night look at the stars and a smoke.No need for clothes for this, none.I made the mistake, and I just knew this might happen, of letting the door close behind me.Outside, naked, no card key, no phone.I was worried that I'd have to wait and watch for the bike security to roll by and explain my pathetic situated.All I had available in the patio was my briefcase.In the briefcase was a Swiss Army Knife.I am back in my room.

It is strange after lurking here for years and trying to dive into posting.  I don't want to freak out some members that I feel that I know somewhat through their various postings through the years, but have never actually responded to their various threads, and they have no idea who I am, or would think that I am some freakazoid when I do respond.

Her worst album by far IMO) CWorst albums include:Chris Cornell - Scream D-John Rich - Son Of A Preacher Man FIda Maria - Fortress Around My Heart D+Looking forward to these albums and more:Mandy Moore - Amanda LeighBrooke White - New ReleaseLove Willows - Hey! Hey!Jonas Brothers - Lines, Vines and Trying Times Aly & AJ - New ReleaseMari Digby - Breathing Underwater (despite the first single)Pete Yorn - Back And FourthRegina Spektor - FarLakisha Jones - So Glad It's MeMichelle Branch - New ReleaseJessica Harp - New ReleaseThe Like - New ReleaseEels - New ReleaseParamore - New ReleaseWilco - New ReleaseAnd maybe a release from A Fine Frenzy, whose One Cell In The Sea is A++!And I still need to buy some, like the Great Northern, Melinda Doolittle, and Wussy albums.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topgraywarrior      (1000+ posts)Mon May-18-09 09:23 AMResponse to Reply #18761907.Kelly Clarkson?Bob?Interesting list.

No passes, but a line that gets longer during the day, so try to do that first.Nothing else has a line, it's a very compact and rich museum, you can easily see everything in one day, four to six hours.Don't miss going up on the living roof for the view.Park in the underground lot, directly under the museum.Street parking is too much work to find.PM me if you have more specific questions.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPetrushka      (1000+ posts)Fri Aug-07-09 11:04 PMResponse to Original message2524.Hang on! Duck Tape An old man was sitting on his front porch down in Louisiana watching the sun rise. He sees the neighbor's kid walk by carrying something big under his arm. He yells out "Hey boy, whatcha got there?" The boy yells back "Roll of chicken wire." Old man says "What you gonna do with that?" Boy says "Gonna catch some chickens." Old man yells "Your a damn fool, you can't catch chickens with chicken wire!" The boy just laughs and keeps walking. That evening at sunset the boy comes walking by and to the old man's surprise he is dragging behind him the chicken wire with about 30 chickens caught in it. Same time next morning -- the old man is out watching the sun rise and he sees the boy walk by carrying something kind of round in his hand. Old man yells out "Hey boy, whatcha got there?" Boy yells back "Roll of duck tape." Old man says "What you gonna do with that?" Boy says back "Gonna catch me some ducks." Old man yells back, "Your a damn fool, you can't catch ducks with duck tape!" The boy just laughs and keeps walking. That night around sunset the boy walks by coming home and to the old man's amazement he is trailing behind him the unrolled roll of duck tape with about 35 ducks caught in it. Same time next morning -- the old man sees the boy walking by carrying what looks like a long reed with something fuzzy on the end. Old man says "Hey boy, whatcha got there?" Boy says "It's a pussy willow." The old man says "Hang on, I'll get my hat."

There once was a little autistic five year old child in kindergarten in Florida <ofcourse> who was voted out of his kindergarten class and publicly humiliated by his TEACHER! I am not making this up! Here's the Federal Lawsuit that his mommy filed: http://web.tcpalm.com/2009/08/27/schoolsuit.pdf This is an editorial written about the Survivor TV turned class exercise: http://www.palmbeachpost.com/opinion/content/opinion/ep... It turns out the teacher rigged the vote!You cant make this stuff up! The lawsuit also alleges:That Ms. Portillo yelled at and threatened Alex's mother, Melissa Barton, and blocked her from leaving the classroom after Ms. Barton asked about the Survivor vote;That in days prior to the vote Ms. Portillo repeatedly stepped on 5-year-old Alex's feet, "dug her nails into his legs and arms" and lifted him off the ground by grabbing his collar;That as late as March 2009 the Bartons and the St. Lucie County School District had agreed on a plan to let Alex continue at Northpoint Elementary but that the teachers union refused to accept the child and threatened to sue if he or other "unwanted" children were placed in a class;That Morningside assistant principal Patricia Gasgoine once confronted the Bartons when they picked up Alex's older brother from school and "proceeded to press her behind against the car door to expose her rear end to the occupants;" andThat because of a confrontation with a mob at the school and other threats, the Bartons have had to move to Martin County.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNYC_SKP      (1000+ posts)      Fri Sep-25-09 10:18 AMResponse to Reply #28102848.Whoa, great but sad story....

He and his daughter both worked that day at Katz's deli but they were still celebrating and included me. So, you splurged on a pie.I like that!!!

They were embarrassing. Crystal picked a great song choice. While I heard some nerves when she let loose, she showed she is on a different level. Same with Casey, who made a song I wasn't crazy about sound respectable.Simon went too far with Didi - beyond honesty into being cruel. While Didi was a bit too deliberate, she was good. Katie and Aaron were also decent and sounded their age. Michael's vocals were fine, but he didn't make the song interesting. Siobhan is adorable, but a little screechy tonight.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topgraywarrior      (1000+ posts)Tue Mar-23-10 10:40 PMResponse to Reply #38663867.Sawyer wasn't on LOST tonight.Still, it was one of the better shows.

Crystal showed another side of herself successfully. Thought Casey's vocals definitely rocked, though the arrangements could have been less cheesy. Michael's vocals were splendid; I thought it was his best performance yet. Yes, Crystal and Michael were a little old fashioned, but I like old fashioned R&B.Thought DiDi was a bit too showy this week. Last week, being dramatic worked to her advantage because it was a song with more attitude.Katie showed she has a good voice, but "Chain Of Fools" requires a LOT of soul - she does not have enough yet to do a great job with that song. Still, it could have been worse considering.Lee was over the top IMO; reminded me of Danny Gokey.Like Michael, Aaron had his best performance IMO. He seems to be getting better every week. Siobhan made me worry that without her scream, she's a more ordinary singer. She's still interesting, though.Tim didn't go off key often, which is a plus for him - but the performance was definitely vapid. He'd be better off having fun and being bad than being forgettable. What can I say - unlike the judges, I didn't like Andrew's performance. Just think his tone is off-putting. And that thing with his mom was cloying. Almost like Idol wants Andrew to stay.Other notes:I did think Paige deserved to go last week, BUT she was confusing. That ending performance showed she could be a competitor. But other performances wouldn't get her past the auditions.

Complete insult to the Beatles. In fact, I was on a different page from them much of the night. Lee was even worse than Tim with his wailing through that song. I thought Andrew was listenable for the first time, even though he was still fair. Thought Katie was too thin with that higher register; I prefer her lower register. Thought Casey was more pitchy than usual, and though he was emotional, there was something lacking - like he was tentative. Pretty good, though. I still like Casey.We did agree on Aaron, who I think had diminishing returns tonight. I thought Crystal had one of her best performances - a Janis meet Sheryl Crow deal. Thought Siobhan rebounded with a lovely performance - I enjoy her uniqueness. And Michael successfully made "Eleanor Rigby" R&B-influenced. Commercial, but good commercial.

Instead of helping, she's waiting to see what errors I will make and then judge me for said mistakes.Do parents not help their children move out? Or is that something one is expected to do on his/her own since the mover is presumably old enough to do so? I'm genuinely curious.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPetrushka      (1000+ posts)Thu May-06-10 12:30 AMResponse to Original message4060.4060Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topalfredo      (1000+ posts)      Thu May-06-10 01:02 AMResponse to Original message4061.YesPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnolabear      (1000+ posts)      Thu May-06-10 01:05 AMResponse to Original message4062.Take THAT!

Now he wants me to be his sidekick in making schools green, developing outdoor ed programs, lots more.My challenge was to find out if he'd hire me AND let me keep my position with a non-profit and continue another "Dream Schools" contract, on the side, extra pay.And I didn't even have to ask, he said "you ought to try to keep those positions". My other two, existing bosses know I had this opportunity and said to find out if he'd let me stay on with them, so he was the clincher.This morning's meeting was HUGH!

However NGC 4527 is no closer than 20 times the distance to the Andromeda galaxy ( which is only 2 million light years away). The distance to this galaxy cannot be easily computed based on the expansion of the Universe since the galaxy itself has a high velocity within the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. A supernova occured in this galaxy in 1991. This could have helped nail down its distance by acting as a "standard candle." However, the light (curve) emitted by this particular stellar explosion was atypical and the distance to NGC 4527 still remains a bit uncertain.

Provenance: 1. Sam Fogg Rare Books Ltd., London. Commentary: The classic example of early Timurid Qur'an production: the sinuous, bold muhaqqaq script, outlined in gold, is unsurpassed, superior even to the celebrated Baysunghur Quran. James writes that the MS from which this leaf originates must have been one of the finest of its type to have been produced in the late 14th or early 15th c.; and according to an uncorroborated source, the calligrapher was a master called Karamshah Tabrizi-. The script is a magnificent black muhaqqaq outlined in gold and unusually thin, given its large size. This serves to emphasise the total control of the calligrapher over his pen; such faultless perfection was equalled only by Ibn al-Suhrawardi in the Qur'an he produced in Baghdad in the early 14th c, probably for Ghazan Khan.

They are just opinions, and really no better than the opinions of people who aren't critics. I think newspapers/websites would be better off putting a "recommended albums, books, movies" section so people can find new stuff.If anything, music critics have gotten worse than movie critics. Music critics tend to be petty, biased, narrow-minded, and want albums to conform to what they think they should be. I'm not sure anyone in professional music criticism is as fair as Roger Ebert is in movies. Music critics range from decent (Ann Powers, Stephen Thomas Erlewine), to bad (many, many of them,) to horrible (Jim DeRogatis (and the new guy at the Sun-Times, Thomas Connor), and the Slant Magazine critics.)

It is almost entirely made up of silica and is dispersed over a large area of the Great Sand Sea in Egypt. Analysis of the chemical composition of several different Libyan Desert Glasses confirmed their close compositional relationship to the mature Sandstones of the Jurassic-Cretaceous era 71 - 195 million years ago. Testing results confirm that LDG's are impact-derived glasses (impactites), and have chemical features similar to Muong Nong tektites. Possible inclusions are bubbles, Cristobalite, and sometimes dark streaks, but Libyan Desert Glass can be milky from thousands of bubbles or gem quality with almost no impurities.' paraphrased from "Geochemistry and the origin of Libyan Desert Glasses" 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topcynatnite      (1000+ posts)      Fri Oct-29-10 12:47 AMResponse to Original message4611.The duck is free?Sorry, I've been away.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topseaker      (984 posts)Mon Nov-01-10 11:45 PMResponse to Reply #46114612.I am not sureHappy 11/1/10Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPetrushka      (1000+ posts)Wed Nov-03-10 02:19 AMResponse to Reply #46114613.This one isn't  --->Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopWillParkinson      (1000+ posts)      Thu Nov-04-10 10:09 AMResponse to Original message4614.I have never once posted in this thread...But I cannot in good conscience deny a request such as this.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopNYC_SKP      (1000+ posts)      Thu Nov-04-10 11:18 PMResponse to Original message4615.+1  n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnolabear      (1000+ posts)      Fri Nov-05-10 12:30 AMResponse to Original message4616.4660Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnolabear      (1000+ posts)      Fri Nov-05-10 12:30 AMResponse to Reply #46164617.Or not.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopPetrushka      (1000+ posts)Fri Nov-05-10 01:29 AMResponse to Original message4618.4618NGC 4618An ultraviolet image of NGC 4618 taken with GALEX.
