Maddow hosts a nightly television show, The Rachel Maddow Show, on MSNBC.[3] She was a guest host of Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Race for the White House. Maddow is the first openly gay anchor to be hired to host a prime-time news program in the United States.[4][5][6][7]Asked about her political views by the Valley Advocate, Maddow replied, "I'm undoubtedly a liberal, which means that I'm in almost total agreement with the Eisenhower-era Republican party platform."[8]Contents1 Early life and education2 Radio career3 Television career3.1 The Rachel Maddow Show4 Personal life5 2012 Massachusetts Senate race6 Honors and awards7 References8 External links[edit] Early life and educationMaddow was born in Castro Valley, California, is the daughter of Robert B. "Bob" Maddow, a former United States Air Force captain and a lawyer for the East Bay Municipal Utility District, and Elaine Maddow (ne Gosse), a school program administrator from Newfoundland, Canada.[9][10][11] She has one older brother, David. Maddow's mother was raised a strict Roman Catholic, and Maddow herself grew up in a community that her mother has described as "very conservative."[12][13] Maddow was a competitive athlete and played three sports in high school.[14] Referencing John Hughes films, she describes herself in high school as "a cross between the jock and the antisocial girl."[13]A graduate of Castro Valley High School in Castro Valley, Maddow earned a degree in public policy from Stanford University in 1994.[15] At graduation she was awarded the John Gardner Fellowship. She was also the recipient of a Rhodes Scholarship and began her postgraduate study in 1995 at Lincoln College, Oxford. In 2001, she earned a Doctorate in Philosophy (DPhil) in politics from Oxford University.[16] Her thesis is titled HIV/AIDS and Health Care Reform in British and American Prisons (supervisor: Dr Lucia Zedner). She is the first openly gay American to win a Rhodes scholarship.[17][18][edit] Radio careerMaddow's first radio hosting job was at WRNX (100.9 FM) in Holyoke, Massachusetts after she entered and won a contest the station held to find a new on-air personality.[19] She was hired to co-host WRNX's then-premier morning show, The Dave in the Morning Show. She went on to host Big Breakfast on WRSI, in Northampton, Massachusetts for two years. She left the show in March 2004 to join the new Air America.[16] There she hosted Unfiltered along with Chuck D (of the hip hop group Public Enemy) and Lizz Winstead (co-creator of The Daily Show), until its cancellation in March 2005.[20] Two weeks after the cancellation of Unfiltered in April 2005, Maddow's weekday two-hour radio program, The Rachel Maddow Show, began airing; in March 2008 it gained an hour, broadcasting from 6 to 9 p.m. EST with David Bender filling in the third hour for the call-in section, when Maddow was on TV assignment. In September 2008 the show's length returned to two hours when Maddow began her nightly MSNBC television program. In February 2009, after renewing her contract with Air America, Maddow returned to the 5 a.m. hourlong slot.[21] Her last Air America show was on January 21, 2010, two weeks before its owners filed bankruptcy.[22][edit] Television careerIn June 2005 Maddow became a regular panelist on MSNBC's Tucker.[23] During and after the November 2006 election, she was a frequent guest on CNN's Paula Zahn Now. In January 2008, Maddow was given the position of MSNBC political analyst and was a regular panelist on MSNBC's Race for the White House with David Gregory and MSNBC's election coverage, as well as a frequent contributor on Countdown with Keith Olbermann.[16]In April 2008, Maddow was the substitute host for Countdown with Keith Olbermann, her first time hosting a program on MSNBC. Maddow described herself on air as "nervous." Keith Olbermann complimented her work and she was brought back to host "Countdown" in May 2008. The day she hosted was the highest rated news program among people 25 to 54 years old, a demographic key to ratings.[24] For her success, the next Monday Olbermann ranked Maddow third in his show's segment "World's Best Persons," calling her the "World's Best Pinch-Hitter."[25] Maddow filled in again on Countdown for eight and a half broadcasts while Olbermann was on vacation in July 2008 and the second half of the show on July 21.[26] Maddow also filled in for David Gregory as host of Race for the White House.[16][edit] The Rachel Maddow ShowMain article: The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)MSNBC announced in August 2008 The Rachel Maddow Show would replace Verdict with Dan Abrams in the channel's 9 p.m. slot the next month.[27][28] Since its debut the show has topped Countdown as the highest rated show on MSNBC on several occasions.[29][30] After being on air for more than a month, Maddow's program doubled the audience that hour.[31]Early reviews for her show were mostly positive. Los Angeles Times writer Matea Gold stated Maddow "finds the right formula on MSNBC,"[32] and The Guardian writes Maddow has become the "star of America's cable news."[18] Associated Press columnist David Bauder said she's "[Keith] Olbermann's political soul mate" and the Olbermann-Maddow shows are a "liberal two-hour block."[33]Distinguishing herself from others on the left, Maddow said she's a "national security conservative" and in a different interview that she's not "a partisan."[34][35] The New York Times called her a "defense policy wonk" who is writing a book on the role of the military in postwar American politics.[34][32] During the 2008 presidential election Maddow did not formally support any candidate. Concerning Barack Obama's candidacy, Maddow said during the primaries, "I have never and still don't think of myself as an Obama supporter, either professionally or actually."[36][edit] Personal lifeMaddow lives in Manhattan and western Massachusetts with her partner, artist Susan Mikula.[37][38] The couple met in 1999, when Mikula hired Maddow to do yard work at her home. Maddow was working on her doctoral dissertation at the time.[37] Maddow does not own a television set, but does sometimes watch streaming broadcast content on her computer.[39][citation needed] However, she is reportedly committed to getting one so that Mikula can watch her show.[31] Although Massachusetts recognizes same-sex marriage, as of 2009 Maddow and Mikula had no plans to marry.[13][edit] 2012 Massachusetts Senate raceIn March 2010, Republican Scott Brown, the junior United States Senator from Massachusetts, speculated that Maddow was going to run against him for his seat in 2012. He used this premise for a fundraising email that read "...The Massachusetts political machine is looking for someone to run against me. And you're not going to believe who they are supposedly trying to recruit liberal MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow." Maddow said Brown's speculation was false. On her March 23, 2010, TV program, Maddow said, "I have the best job in the world. I am not running for office. Scott Brown didn't ask me if I was running or planning to run for office, before he wrote a fundraising letter with my name. No, it's completely made up by him." Despite her comments, the next day Brown continued along the same line, telling a Boston radio station, "Bring her on." To help put an end to the matter, Maddow ran a full-page advertisement in the Boston Globe confirming she was not running, and separately demanded Brown's apology. She added that despite repeated invitations over the months, Brown had refused to appear on her TV program.[40][41][42][43][edit] Honors and awardsMaddow was named in Out magazine's "Out 100" list of the "gay men and women who moved culture" in 2008.[44]Maddow was voted "Lesbian/Bi Woman of the Year (American)" in AfterEllen's 2008 Visibility Awards.[45]Maddow won a Gracie Award in 2009, presented by the American Women in Radio and Television.[46]In 2009, Maddow was nominated for GLAAD's 20th Annual Media Awards for a segment of her MSNBC show, "Rick Warren, Change To Believe In?", in the Outstanding TV Journalism Segment category.[47]On March 28, 2009, Maddow received a Proclamation of Honor from the California State Senate, presented in San Francisco by California State Senator Mark Leno.[48]In April 2009, she was listed at number four in Out magazine's Annual Power 50 List.[49]Maddow placed sixth in the "2009 AfterEllen.com Hot 100" list (May 11, 2009)[50] and third in its "2009 Hot 100: Out Women" version.[51]Maddow was included on a list of openly gay media professionals in The Advocate's "Forty under 40" issue of June/July 2009.[52]In 1994, Maddow was an Honorable Mention in the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity Prize in Ethics.[53]In June 2009, Maddow's MSNBC show was the only cable news show nominated for a Television Critics Association award in the Outstanding Achievement in News and Information category.[54]In March 2010, Maddow won at the 21st Annual GLAAD Media Awards in the category, Outstanding TV Journalism- Newsmagazine for her segment, "Uganda Be Kidding Me".[55]Maddow was the 2010 commencement speaker and was given an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) degree at Smith College in Northampton, MA in May 2010.[56]In July 2010, Maddow was presented with a Maggie Award for her ongoing reporting of healthcare reform, the murder of Dr. George Tiller, and the anti-abortion movement.[57]In August 2010, Maddow won the Walter Cronkite Faith & Freedom Award, which was presented by The Interfaith Alliance.[58] Past honorees included Larry King, Tom Brokaw, and the late Peter Jennings.[58][edit] References^ Adler, Margot (2008-10-23).
