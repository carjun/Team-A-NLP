Giffords showing positive signs GallerySee all 11 photos Congresswoman shot32.33594-110.97630View larger mapTUCSON, Ariz. (AP)   Rep. Gabrielle Giffords remained heavily sedated and in critical  condition Sunday as investigators sought to understand what motivated a  gunman to carry out an assassination attempt on the Democratic lawmaker  in a rampage that killed six people.University Medical Center  spokeswoman Darci Slaten told The Associated Press that Giffords  underwent a two-hour surgery Saturday and has not been conscious since  the shooting. She said more information will be released at a news  conference in which one of the doctors who operated on Giffords plans to  speak.Outside of the hospital, candles flickered at a makeshift  memorial. Signs read "Peace + love are stronger," ''God bless America  and "We love you, Gabrielle." People also laid down bouquets of flowers,  American flags and pictures of Giffords.Authorities said  Gifford, 40, was targeted at a public gathering by a man with a  semiautomatic weapon around 10 a.m. Saturday outside a busy Tucson  supermarket. Arizona's chief federal judge and five others were killed  and 13 people were wounded, including the Democrat lawmaker.He  also fired at her district director and shot indiscriminately at  staffers and others standing in line to talk to the congresswoman, said  Mark Kimble, a communications staffer for Giffords."He was not  more than three or four feet from the congresswoman and the district  director," Kimble said, describing the scene as "just complete chaos,  people screaming, crying."Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik  said the rampage ended only after two people tackled the gunman."He  was definitely on a mission," said Villec, a former Giffords intern.Police  say the shooter was in custody, and was identified by people familiar  with the investigation as Jared Loughner, 22. U.S. officials who  provided his name to the AP spoke on condition of anonymity because they  were not authorized to release it publicly.His motivation was  not immediately known, but Dupnik described him as mentally unstable and  possibly acting with an accomplice.His office said a man  possibly associated with the suspect who was near the scene was being  sought. The man, who was photographed by a security camera, was  described as white with dark hair and 40-45 years old.The  assassination attempt left Americans questioning whether divisive  politics had pushed the suspect over the edge.A shaken President  Barack Obama called the attack "a tragedy for our entire country."Attorney  General Eric Holder said in a statement Sunday that FBI Director Robert  Mueller was traveling to Arizona to help coordinate the investigation.In  a brief statement Sunday morning, House Speaker John Boehner said flags  on the House side of the Capitol in Washington will be flown at half  staff to honor Giffords' slain aide, Gabe Zimmerman. Boehner says normal  House business this week is postponed to focus on any necessary actions  in the shooting aftermath.Strong reaction came from overseas, as  well.British Prime Minister David Cameron expressed shock at the  shooting, and added that he shared President Barack Obama's belief that  "we must never allow violence and hate to extinguish the open political  discourse which is our surest protection."Fidel Castro also  denounced the attack as atrocious. "Even those of us who don't share at  all the politics and philosophies (of the Obama administration)  sincerely desire that no children, judges, legislators or citizens of  the United States die in such an absurd and unjustifiable way," Castro  said in an opinion piece titled "An Atrocious Act," published in Cuban  state-controlled media.Giffords is a moderate Democrat who  narrowly won re-election in November against a tea party candidate who  sought to throw her from office over her support of the health care law.  Anger over her position became violent at times, with her Tucson office  vandalized after the House passed the overhaul last March and someone  showing up at a recent gathering with a weapon.Authorities said  the dead included U.S. District Judge John Roll, 63; Christina Greene,  9; Giffords aide Zimmerman, 30; Dorothy Morris, 76; Dorwin Stoddard, 76;  and Phyllis Scheck, 79.The sheriff blamed the vitriolic  political rhetoric that has consumed the country, much of it occurring  in Arizona.Giffords expressed similar concern, even before the  shooting. In an interview after her office was vandalized, she referred  to the animosity against her by conservatives, including Sarah Palin's  decision to list Giffords' seat as one of the top "targets" in the  midterm elections."For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted  list, but the thing is, that the way that she has it depicted has the  crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they  have to realize that there are consequences to that action," Giffords  said in an interview with MSNBC.In the hours after the shooting,  Palin issued a statement in which she expressed her "sincere  condolences" to the family of Giffords and the other victims.During  his campaign effort to unseat Giffords in November, Republican  challenger Jesse Kelly held fundraisers where he urged supporters to  help remove Giffords from office by joining him to shoot a fully loaded  M-16 rifle. Kelly is a former Marine who served in Iraq and was pictured  on his website in military gear holding his automatic weapon and  promoting the event."I don't see the connection," between the  fundraisers featuring weapons and Saturday's shooting, said John  Ellinwood, Kelly's spokesman. "I don't know this person, we cannot find  any records that he was associated with the campaign in any way. I just  don't see the connection."Arizona is a state where people are  firearms owners  this was just a deranged individual."Law  enforcement officials said members of Congress reported 42 cases of  threats or violence in the first three months of 2010, nearly three  times the 15 cases reported during the same period a year earlier.  Nearly all dealt with the health care bill, and Giffords was among the  targets.The shooting cast a pall over the Capitol as politicians  of all stripes denounced the attack as a horrific. Capitol police asked  members of Congress to be more vigilant about security in the wake of  the shooting. Obama dispatched his FBI chief to Arizona.Slaten  said nine other wounded were being treated at the hospital, four of them  critical and five of them serious. Slaten said the three others were  treated at other hospitals and released.Giffords spokesman C.J.  Karamargin said besides the aide Zimmerman, who was killed, two other  Giffords staffers were shot but expected to survive. Zimmerman was a  former social worker who served as Giffords' director of community  outreach.Greg Segalini, an uncle of Christina, the 9-year-old  victim, told the Arizona Republic that a neighbor was going to the event  and invited her along because she had just been elected to the student  council and was interested in government.Christina, who was born  on Sept. 11, 2001, was involved in many activities, from ballet to  baseball. She had just received her first Holy Communion at St. Odilia's  Catholic Church in Tucson, Catholic Diocese of Tucson officials told  The Arizona Daily Star.The suspect Loughner was described by a  former classmate as a pot-smoking loner, and the Army said he tried to  enlist in December 2008 but was rejected for reasons not disclosed.Federal  law enforcement officials were poring over versions of a MySpace page  that included a mysterious "Goodbye friends" message published hours  before the shooting and exhorted his friends to "Please don't be mad at  me."In one of several YouTube videos, which featured text against a dark  background, Loughner described inventing a new U.S. currency and  complained about the illiteracy rate among people living in Giffords'  congressional district in Arizona."I know who's listening:  Government Officials, and the People," Loughner wrote. "Nearly all the  people, who don't know this accurate information of a new currency,  aren't aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil  rights, then this message wouldn't have happen (sic)."In  Loughner's middle-class neighborhood  about a five-minute drive from  the scene  sheriff's deputies had much of the street blocked off. The  neighborhood sits just off a bustling Tucson street and is lined with  desert landscaping and palm trees.Neighbors said Loughner lived  with his parents and kept to himself. He was often seen walking his dog,  almost always wearing a hooded sweat shirt and listening to his iPod.Loughner's  MySpace profile indicates he attended and graduated from school in  Tucson and had taken college classes. He did not say if he was employed.High  school classmate Grant Wiens, 22, said Loughner seemed to be "floating  through life" and "doing his own thing.""Sometimes religion was  brought up or drugs. He smoked pot, I don't know how regularly. And he  wasn't too keen on religion, from what I could tell," Wiens said.Lynda  Sorenson said she took a math class with Loughner last summer at Pima  Community College's Northwest campus and told the Arizona Daily Star he  was "obviously very disturbed." ''He disrupted class frequently with  nonsensical outbursts," she said.In October 2007, Loughner was  cited in Pima County for possession of drug paraphernalia, which was  dismissed after he completed a diversion program, according to online  records.Giffords was first elected to Congress amid a wave of  Democratic victories in the 2006 election, and has been mentioned as a  possible Senate candidate in 2012 and a gubernatorial prospect in 2014.She  is married to astronaut Mark E. Kelly, who has piloted space shuttles  Endeavour and Discovery. The two met in China in 2003 while they were  serving on a committee there, and were married in January 2007. Sen.  Bill Nelson, chairman of the Senate Commerce Space and Science  Subcommittee, said Kelly is training to be the next commander of the  space shuttle mission slated for April. His brother is currently serving  aboard the International Space Station, Nelson said.___Associated  Press Writers Amanda Lee Myers and Terry Tang in Tucson, Jacques  Billeaud, Bob Christie and Paul Davenport in Phoenix, and David Espo,  Matt Apuzzo, Eileen Sullivan, Adam Goldman and Charles Babington in  Washington contributed to this report.Share this article:45 CommentsEmail this articleFacebookTweetDiggPrint this articlePrintprintPrevious article Surgeons say Rep.

Rick Barber ran for office in Alabama and made TV commercials featuring actors dressed as founding fathers. After hearing his BS they replied "gather your armies". (on YouTube) Also, don't forget that gun-toting maniac Dale Peterson. (YouTube) Don't forget Ted Nugent. Exactly what do these messages imply? To those of us who are mentally stable it's ridiculous political theater. However, nutcases like this guy take it seriously. Name one democrat who uses gun innuendos and/or gun props in their campaigns other than for a photo op? The right wing paranoid culture endorses the use of guns and violence to get their point across. That message has now manifested itself in this horrible act of violence. Perhaps I got on a tangent in an earlier post, but I stick to my point.58590288Flag this commentplanogirl said on January 9, 2011 at 6:36 PMIbuprofen, you give this guy way too much credit.  You're assuming he could understand your agenda, when he doesn't have enough grasp of reality to create his own agenda.  What he had was a series of paranoid rants.

His political identity doesn't matter. The right constantly spews dangerous hate rhetoric. Fox News is NOT a news bureau, they are a conservative SIG. Palin had a map with GUN  targets marking who she wanted to take down. It's the REPUBLIKANS who tote around guns making these innuendos, and when something actually happens they fall back on the usual defense. They constantly imply liberals are the enemy of democracy when it's them who most threaten our way of life. These right-wing nuts are one thing, there's one word to sum up their character. They are just plain mean. If they cannot win an issue, they just send people kill us instead. The right has gone too far worshiping the wealthy, large corporations and guns. They spread a false religion of lower-taxes and constantly perpetrate the idea that capitalism is flawless and self-correcting. Conservatives are running this nation into the ground by continually stomping on the middle class.58579184Flag this commentplanogirl said on January 9, 2011 at 12:33 PMI worry that this will negatively impact people who suffer from mental illness, and aren't violent.  The Powers that Be will be more likely to start taking "precautions" that punish people who ask for help, and make other less likely to consider asking. It's like twenty steps back for people who need help, and now won't ask for it after those "precautions" start settling into place.58572907Flag this commentroguewarrior said on January 9, 2011 at 11:41 AM"Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand."

I am a conservative, however I recognize that neither party has truly helped America with their bickering.58570981Flag this commentdanta said on January 9, 2011 at 11:33 AMWow, one lone gunman nutcase acts out and the rest are critics. He was a looney, nothing more. The cause may have been literacy for all we know at this time since his published views are so rambling. The net effect of the shooting is that our elected representatives and all government officials will be just that much more remote from the voters as the need for security overides the need to talk to the public, and for once, I don't blame them. I think I'd want some protection too from the crazies out there if I was in their place.58570724Flag this commentbeard said on January 9, 2011 at 11:26 AMAs conservatives say Democrats and Liberals are the enemy of this country.  When a politcal party supports socialism, communism.  Such as social Security, Welfare, Medicare, OSCHA, EPA, Obamacare. This kind of thing is going to happen.
