Yes, I've reported the Miami Herald's hiring of public relations guru Bruce Rubin, who helped the newspaper form its "media strategy" after the Jim DeFede firing. So brace yourself; you're getting 100-proof, straight-to-the-gut, first-rate-newspaper grade information here. First off, it's clear that the Herald didn't want the public to know that it had hired Rubin. The newspaper not only didn't publicly acknowledge it at the time, but apparently stonewalled one of its own reporters on the issue. Check out this item by Joan Fleischman, the Herald's Talk of the Town columnist. It appeared on August 3, just a week after Art Teele's suicide and Jim DeFede's firing: CRISIS AND MANAGEMENTSpotted at The Herald last Friday: Bruce Rubin, a public relations exec who specializes in corporate crisis management. It was a tough couple days at 1 Herald Plaza. Commissioner Arthur E. Teele Jr., 59, committed suicide Wednesday in The Herald's lobby, and Metro columnist Jim DeFede, 42, got fired that same night after admitting he tape recorded a phone conversation he had with Teele -- without Teele's permission, and possibly in violation of Florida law -- less than an hour before Teele shot himself in the head.Rubin, 58, senior counselor to the Coral Gables-based rbb PR firm, declined to discuss his Herald presence. ''I really don't like to talk about my work.''One of the newspaper's own veteran reporters couldn't get an answer as to whether the Herald hired Rubin or not. And the man who gave Fleischman a "no comment" is the same Rubin who wrote a comment on this blog Tuesday about how he was "disappointed" that I didn't call him about his Herald work so that he could tell me "precisely what [his] role, if any, might have been." Because Fleischman was rebuffed, the item was reduced to sheer speculation -- and most people, including myself, didn't notice. Nothing else about Rubin's behind-the-scene role was published in any of the many stories in the Herald or in the national press about the DeFede firing. It's easy to understand why the Herald wouldn't want that bit of information going public. Editor Tom Fiedler had made a highly unpopular decision to fire a popular columnist. Now the newspaper was having such a hard time explaining the action that it needed professional help. Unseemly and embarrassing are two words that come to mind. The fact is that newspapers, whose fundamental job in society is to get at the truth so often obscured by P.R. people, rarely hire -- or rarely admit hiring -- outside P.R. help on newsroom matters. Did the New York Times hire a P.R. firm to help it with the Jayson Blair or Judith Miller scandals? Times spokesman Toby Usnik wouldn't answer that question directly, but downplayed the possibility. "By and large we handle everything internally," Usnik told me. "There are some exceptions." Usnik mentioned the huge New York Times Travel Show as being one of those exceptions, but wouldn't say whether outside firms had been used for newsroom controversies. The only instance I could confirm where a newspaper openly hired a P.R. firm in such an instance is occurring right now: The New York Post has public relations man Howard Rubenstein handling the Page Six scandal.  But that's the New York Post. The Herald didn't disclose the relationship with Rubin -- who has been quoted more than 100 times in the newspaper while representing major clients like Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria and developer Armando Codina -- until it slipped through a Business Monday column by reporter Douglas Hanks III. Hanks informed me that he didn't consider it breaking news because of the previous Fleischman column, and, by all indications, neither did his editors. It was an unintentional admission. I wrote about the buried revelation on Tuesday and had some fun with the idea that Fiedler might have taken Rubin's advice when he wrote a column about the hiring on July 31. Then things began to get interesting. Romenesko posted my item on the Poynter site, which is read by the national press. Fiedler then wrote an e-mail to me, which was also quickly posted on Romenesko. Fiedler wrote that he never talked to Rubin about the DeFede matter and complained that I should have called him before writing my item.  So I started making phone calls, beginning with Rubin.  "If you had called before, I would have told you what I did and what I didn't do," he said. "Well, sort of, I mean, I wouldn't have bared my soul to you." Then he kept saying he wanted to "schmooze" with me. I asked him if schmoozing meant it was off the record. He said it was between him and me. We basically schmoozed the whole time because he didn't want to go on the record about much of anything. He did tell me for publication that he never talked to Fiedler about the DeFede firing and confirmed that he gave his advice to Publisher Jesus Diaz Jr. Okay. Here was my pop hypothesis: Rubin counsels Diaz, Diaz counsels Fiedler. Why would Fiedler have to talk with Rubin if Diaz was already doing so? P.R. help is had while the newsroom is protected. Win-win.  I phoned Fiedler, who hadn't returned my calls in the past. He ringed me from the airport, where he was about to leave for a vacation to see his grandkids in the Washington D.C. area. It was the first time I had spoken with him and what I had heard was true; he sounded like a nice guy. He tried to explain the Rubin hiring. "The Herald no longer has its own internal public relations person," Fiedler said. "We have a marketing division, but we haven't had anybody who would be our public relations counsel ... Given the fact that we don't have someone internally to send out press releases and hold press conferences, I'm not at all surprised that we would turn to someone that would do that kind of thing during the Jim DeFede situation or any other situation that would come up." But Rubin wasn't sending out press releases -- he was formulating media strategy. And he was doing it secretly. Fiedler said he had no memory of the Fleischman column, but was adamant that he never spoke with Rubin about DeFede and that no outside P.R. people had any contact with the newsroom, something he wouldn't condone. I asked him how often he spoke to Diaz during the time of the DeFede firing. "[Diaz] and I talked constantly during that time, up to the decision [to fire DeFede], and in the aftermath of the decision and in mitigating the decision," Fiedler said. "I think that's perfectly normal." Of course it is, though "mitigating the decision" isn't a phrase you'd normally expect to hear from a veteran newspaperman like Fiedler. I told him my theory that Diaz may have played middleman and given him advice from Rubin's mouth.  "I don't know that but it wouldn't surprise me if that happened," Fiedler said. "If he spoke with a P.R. professional and thought something he said was a good idea and then later on in a discussion with me he said he thought the same thing was a good idea, that wouldn't surprise me at all. And I'm not going to reject good advice." So, after all the e-mails and stonewalling, the truth comes out: Rubin likely did have some influence on the editor through the publisher. In corporate terms, this would be routine business. But newspapers aren't routine businesses -- they work in the truth market, where P.R. firms are looked upon with a jaundiced eye. There's a reason the Herald wasn't forthcoming at the time about hiring Rubin. And the newspaper clearly should have disclosed in every article quoting Rubin on unrelated issues that he had a financial relationship with the newspaper. That didn't happen, either.

Write Comment Email to Friend UncategorizedSentinel Blows It On Michael ChiznerBy Bob Norman,                                                            Thu., Apr. 27 2006 @ 2:14PMCategories:                                                                                                                                                            Uncategorized Buddy Nevins illustrates his aversion to solid reporting today in the Sentinel with this pathetic newslet on North Broward Hospital District heart surgeon Michael Chizner. He calls Chizner a "star heart doctor" and lets Wayne "I Want To Suck Your Blood" Huizenga and other hacks spew forth on the Sentinel page without checking a single fact. "They said Chizner was a superstar who drew patients and donations to the district and he deserved special treatment," Nevins writes. They're wrong, Buddy. The grossly overpaid (at more than $1 million a year) Chizner has been a disaster, not a "superstar." This is not a matter of opinion, but of fact. All you have to do is get the records to see that Chizner has overseen a dramatic decline in patients and has fallen far short of his fundraising promises.  And it's not a small matter -- we are talking about tens of millions of dollars in public (taxpayers') funds and the future of the Broward General Medical Center. That's the truth, not a bunch of puffery from super-wealthy special interests and governor appointees. And Nevins plays up the "Chizner might go elsewhere" angle? We should be so lucky. There's NO WAY IN HELL that Chizner is leaving NBHD on his own volition. He couldn't make half the money he's making at the bloated district anywhere else.The Sentinel editorial board has parroted the Chizner is Great angle too. It's a perfect example of why the Sentinel, though it contains great work by great reporters at times, is essentially still an amateur operation. No wonder Pulitzer frowns on it. Must be karma. Look, I don't want to seem to be singling out Nevins for bad reporting, which is not in short supply in South Florida, but this is right up in my wheelhouse and it's disgraceful. It's like he's reviving his spiked column and calling it reportage. Huizenga, Chizner, George Gill, Steve Berrard ... these guys have enough pull without Buddy carrying their water for them.   I've been hearing a lot of rumors that Buddy is going to be leaving the newspaper soon to work for a politician (two names bantered about have been Jim Waldman, the ex-husband of Nevins' favorite Ali, and Charlie Crist, who, well we all know about that). If this is the kind of junk he's going to produce after his ouster from the political beat, the sooner the better. Yoink!Onto another subject that I wish I didn't have to tackle today: Credit for stories. I want to get away from the issue, but the Sentinel keeps dragging me back in. For the second time today, the Fort Lauderdale newspaper has been found guilty of journalistic larceny. This time it blatantly ripped off the Daily Business Review, which had a scoop by Jordana Mishory yesterday about poor treatment of minorities at the Broward courthouse. Today, the Sentinel redid the story under the byline of Tonya Alanez. Look, I don't blame Alanez, she's just doing her job and it's the editors who should make sure the paper gives proper credit. The Herald has been showing some class in this regard, but the Sentinel (and at times Post) is still in the dark ages, showing itself to be miserly little operation. And I'm coming to the conclusion that its the reporters who have to demand that, when they redo a story that ran in another publication, the original publication be cited. It may be the only way for the Sentinel to become a bigger newspaper, integrity-wise.

It involved the death of Boyd Ogle, a long-time English and journalism teacher at Stranahan High and father of Miami Herald book editor and movie critic Connie Ogle.Flowers and Ogle are good friends and Flowers took great umbrage at the fact that Miami Herald editors chose not to run Connie Ogle's obit on her father in yesterday's newspaper, opting instead to run a "stripped-down version". The news was greatly upsetting. Later, it was decided that Ogle's obit would run as a column in Saturday's newspaper. Flowers, who worked at the Herald for nine years before joining the Sentinel in 2003, went off on her former bosses for the decision not to run the Ogle's original obit. She reconsidered her words, however, and removed the tirade from the web site. Out of deference to Flowers' decision, I'm not going to get into the guts of the original post, but I have to share this passage: "I hope to God that when McClatchy takes over this long-running epidemic of profoundly incompetent, heartless and thoughtless management is weeded out as quickly as possible. I may not have to work there anymore, but a lot of good people still do."Post Credit Magically Disappears  Remember that David Copperfield robbery story? What I didn't mention yesterday was that the Palm Beach Post scooped the Sun-Sentinel, which didn't have a word about it in the newspaper. It was a Jose Lambiet special that went out on AP wire yesterday morning.And that's where it gets interesting, as a Pulp reader pointed out to me.The Sentinel picked up the story off the wire and put it on its web site at 10:41 a.m. yesterday. There was only one change made by Sentinel editors. The AP story quotes Copperfield: "Call it reverse pickpocketing," Copperfield told The Palm Beach Post for Wednesday's editions.In the Sentinel version of the AP story, a bit of it magically disappears: "'Call it reverse pic-pocketing,'' Copperfield said."I'm not talking about the missing "k" in pickpocket (yes, the Sentinel managed to add a typo to the story), but the deleted credit for the Post. There's nothing against the rules about that. And knowing how petty both newspapers can be in their turf battle for Palm Beach County, I'm sure that kind of thing happens all the time. But still, it sure does make you feel a little dirty to watch it in action.

If not, read the comments in the post below. I'm going to do a little bit more reporting on this, but until then, let's move on to ... The DBR Beating a  SubpoenaBroward Circuit Judge Marc Gold proved himself a man of wisdom by quashing (don't you love that word?) a subpoena on Daily Business Review reporter Julie Kay. Kay calls it a "victory for the First Amendment" in the story -- and she's right. If prosecutors start pulling reporters into court for every little thing, we're in big trouble. I, for one, hope Gold has started a trend, since Michael Satz's office has also hit me with a subpoena to testify in the Mafia case involving reputed Bonanno capo Gerard Chilli. It has to do with this story. I don't know nothing. Quash away, please. In Other News ... The Palm Beach Post's Jose Lambiet tells of the robbery of David Copperfield outside Kravis Center in West Palm Beach. And for some reason I bet he really was pretty cool when the gun was pointed at his face. I want to know two things: how to do that pocket trick and how many cops got involved in trying to catch the robbers. Because I'm thinking if that were you or me, nobody would have been "nabbed" ten minutes later. Also in the Post, Larry Kellerproves that it really isn't easy to be a pimp, even if you're dealing with relatively high-class call girls in Boca Raton. Keller writes of David Bachmann's "bad customer list" for the prostitution ring he was running. He had chokers, knife-wielders, and, tell us it ain't so, midgets.  And Keller teases us with the fact that one repeat customer was a "South Florida sports broadcaster." I'm torn on whether it was the right call to withhold the broadcaster's name. On the one hand, I think the whole business should be decriminalized. But the guy (assuming it's a guy) may have broken the law and everyone who reads that will want to know who it is. Does that make it news?  Write Comment Email to Friend UncategorizedHerald Hired P.R. Firm For DeFede FalloutBy Bob Norman,                                                            Tue., Apr. 25 2006 @ 1:19PMCategories:                                                                                                                                                            Uncategorized Tom FiedlerThe admission is buried deep inside a long Miami Herald business column: The newspaper hired a "public relations executive" to handle "media strategy" for the newspaper after it fired columnist Jim DeFede. Herald writer Douglas Hanks III drops the little bombshell as an aside in his Business Monday column yesterday, which was largely guest-written by P.R. man Bruce Rubin. Rubin, Hanks lets us know, was hired by the newspaper to help quell the controversy -- both inside the newsroom and out -- caused by the hasty termination. Suddenly that horrid Tom Fiedler July 31 column in which he tried to explain DeFede's firing makes sense. Perhaps it was at least partially dictated by Rubin. In hindsight, it seems obvious that a P.R. man was operating behind the scenes, even though the newspaper's own stories about the DeFede firing never revealed it. And there's no doubt that Fiedler et al felt the pressure -- hundreds of journalists came out publicly against the firing, including a handful of the Herald's own columnists. The closest Fiedler ever came to coming clean about the firing was in a July 31 column. In the rambling and contradictive missive, Fiedler admitted that his decision was "perplexing" and acknowledged that the tape-recording incident was a "seemingly minor offense." Then he did an about-face and wrote that DeFede had "violated one of the most fundamental tenets of journalism," one that "holds that in all our dealings, we act without hidden motives or practices." DeFede's offense, of course, was surreptitiously tape-recording Art Teele's final phone call, just before the Miami politico killed himself in the Herald's lobby. The tape recording was the wrong thing to do, but it came from a purely journalistic motive: To get and preserve the truth. Why would Fiedler intimate otherwise? Well, maybe a hired gun had something to do with it. Then Fiedler wrote, "When it comes to maintaining our integrity, we must be absolutists." Yeah, that's the ticket. Absolutists. Appeal to the fascist impulse in all of us. Nice work, Rubin, uh, I mean Fiedler. Do newspapers, which would seem to be experts in the media, often hire P.R. firms to help deal with other media? Am I alone in thinking this is an unseemly violation of the trust newspapers have with their readers? The press, after all, is charged with the task of getting past the cover stories of P.R. firms to get to the truth about government, business, etc. If readers can't get the unvarnished truth from the newspaper -- free from the influence of hired obfuscators -- then where can they ever expect to get it?

I know, I know, people find human heads in South Florida all the time -- bobbing in canals, washing up on the beach, jamming up their garbage disposals -- but we rarely get the backstory about the discovery. That's what Babson gives us in today's Herald. Her story gets going when the heroes, three Broward fishermen down in Islamorada, become suspicious. Then comes the inevitable "that's no lobster trap buoy!" moment. "We all looked at each other and said, 'Hmmmm,'" Babson quoted one of the fisherman. Babson is just setting us up for the money shot.   By the second pass, a wave of alarm had swept over the fishing party.One of the men said, ''Did that look like what I thought it was?'' Swinney recalled. 'I said, 'Yeah.' ''As they moved in, Swinney extended his hand and turned the object over in the water.''There was a face looking right at us,'' Marks said.''It had a full set of teeth and about eight vertebrae below the neckline,'' Swinney said.The rest of the body was nowhere in sight. The former Florida Highway Patrol auxiliary member wasted no time.''Marc just grabbed the rib and pulled it right in the back of the boat,'' Marks said.Who does that? Who grabs a decaying severed head/upper torso/what-not and pulls it up onto a boat? Is he fucking crazy? Then Babson writes, "They sought comfort the way fishermen often do." No, it wasn't an impromptu session of hot sweaty man love. They just had a few beers with the head they'd just rescued. And, of course, they took a video clip of the head with their cell phone cameras. Babson didn't report that part, but Channel 4, in a report by Ted Scouten ran the video clip over and over again, though it's difficult to make anything out here.   Finally, Monroe County sheriff's deputies came to pick up the head.  Could have been the end of it, but Babson doesn't let us down: "The head still has some flesh and part of an ear in it. The eyes are gone. Four ribs, a jaw and some vertebrae remain. An examination by Monroe's medical examiner on Monday revealed the remains -- likely from a man -- have shark bite marks but don't seem to show any evidence of inflicted trauma before death." That's reporting, unlike the brief they ran in the Sentinel. Wait a second, that was no brief. That was nothing. The Sentinel missed the story altogether. But they did have a big nothing-new Holocaust story on the front page. The headline on Lisa Huriash's story: "Holocaust's dark secrets still torment." Really? Wow, never heard that before. Good thing it dominated the front page.

I loved that killing machine, especially when it accidentally slaughtered those six civilians in Iraq in January. Last month, Roberto Santiago wrote in the Miami Herald wrote about this year's show: "The annual air and sea extravaganza, a major armed forces recruiting tool, flaunts America's military prowess, which doubles as eye-popping, beachside entertainment. A mock beach invasion gets things started, with U.S. Navy and Marines Corps jets, helicopters, marine vehicles, and armed troops." Airstrike VictimA mock invasion? America's military prowess doubling as "eye-popping beachside entertainment"? Hey, I know, we ought to create a mock Fallujah on the beach! And then destroy it! And we'll use illegal Mexican immigrants for Iraqis. We got the sand, after all! Oh what fun. And you wonder why the rest of the world doesn't cotton to us anymore? There's a terrible criminal war going on right now and a lot of innocent people -- mothers and their babies -- are dying. And we're getting cheap kicks about it on the beach? It's disgusting. But the South Florida press keeps cheering on this sickening display, playing into the hands of "Peeping" Mickey Markoff and helping to disgrace Fort Lauderdale in the process. Don't go.

Blood has been spilled, great reporters have left or been fired, a lot of people are concerned. I don't pretend to understand what's happening. But there is one small issue that I think needs to be settled and it starts back in February when Mark Jurkowitz of the Boston Phoenix quoted then-Voice media critic Sydney Schanberg about NT/VV Executive Editor Michael Lacey's fateful visit with staff. "[Lacey] said he didn't want any stories that referred to other people's work," Schanberg said.  I don't understand that quote, but I wasn't there, and that may have been exactly what was said. Later that month, Schanberg, whose reporting in Southeast Asia won him a Pulitzer Prize and was the basis for the movie "The Killing Fields," quit his job.  Gawker reported that Schanberg felt "that the company was no longer interested in media criticism."On April 13, Schanberg told Amy Goodman of Democracy Now : "My assumption was [Lacey] didn't want to cover the press. His other papers, other New Times paper(s), don't have a press column. He's not interested in that." Here Schanberg acknowledges that he made an "assumption." But then he flatly states that New Times papers don't have any press columns, obviously without bothering to check his facts. And when Schanberg speaks, people listen. Like Marisa Demarco at the Weekly Alibi in Albuquerque, who wrote in her column this week: "Village Voice was the first alternative weekly paper in the country, carrying some of the best media critiques the newspaper biz has ever seen. Lacey walked into a room of talent and started hacking away, looking to make the Voice like all the other weeklies in the chain (none of which have a media criticism space)."When New Times editor Tony Ortega told Demarco that it wasn't the truth, the newspaper quickly took the fallacious line -- "none of which have a media criticism space" -- off the Internet version. Readers of this blog know all too well how much NT values media criticism. I've been writing off and on about local newspapers for long while in the New Times and the blog is all about the media in South Florida. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better digger into the Miami Herald than Miami New Times editor Chuck Strouse. And at Denver Westword, Michael Roberts has been covering the media for several years now. He's not hard to find, Romenesko has him listed on his "Media People" links. In fact, I challenge anyone to find a New Times newspaper that has failed to do any media criticism in the past year. It can't be done. So let's get this straight: The New Times -- and the Village Voice -- do media criticism. And they'll keep doing it, no matter what people say or write.

Hollywood's Political Love Boat"This Steak Is Too Cooked" This is a press release sent from the publicly financed Hollywood Art and Culture center, you know the agency made famous by the leather Alan Koslow vampire suit.

Write Comment Email to Friend UncategorizedThe Rainbow Sentinel?By Bob Norman,                                                            Fri., Apr. 21 2006 @ 8:30AMCategories:                                                                                                                                                            Uncategorized So I was interviewing Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jim Naugle last night about a story and he starts going off about the media, specifically about the Sun-Sentinel. Here's a synopsis of what was said: Naugle: It's a national crisis. People have really lost faith in the media and the new media is saving the situation where people can still find knowledge. Pulp: What "new media" are you talking about? Naugle: You know, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, the blogs, The Daily Pulp, you know. ... Seriously, one of the biggest crises we have today is the biased media. Buddy Nevins said that the Sentinel is the first [mainstream] newspaper in America where homosexuals are the majority. I'm expecting that any day it's going to be called the 'Rainbow Sentinel.'  Pulp: I don't think Nevins said the Sentinel had a gay majority. He just said they had a lot of gays. Naugle: The Scum-Sentinel is an advertising tabloid newsblog. They hire reporters and they make them churn out stories without making them get into anything in depth. They do that to feign a resemblance to a real newspaper so that they can sell advertising. And the Sentinel tries to lecture me about affordable housing? I tell people that the day I take advice from a company that has vagrants selling their products in the middle of the street, we're all in trouble." Say what you will about Naugle, but he's a hoot. He also talked about the housing market. I did a Q & A with him a few years back where he told me he'd  amassed a million dollars in real estate. Since then he's doubled it, including a bundle on a second home in Bimini. Anyway, he says not to worry about housing prices: "We just need to recruit companies from cities where housing is more expensive than it is here and there are plenty of them. Bring somebody from New York City and they say, 'Wow, I'll take two.'" What about working class folk? The mayor said they'll live in multi-family units and work in the service industry. Somebody has to clean up, you know. "People are making a living walking dogs and cleaning up dog poop and picking up garbage in people's yards," he said. Heralding The DayYeah, today is the Miami Herald's day. First we the news that Guy Tunnell, the head of the FDLE, resigned. It's part of the fallout of the boot camp death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Chalk one up for Carol Marbin Miller, who bird-dogged that story in a phenomenal way. It also didn't hurt that Tunnell, who is apparently a bona fide idiot, compared Barack Obama to Osama bin Laden and Jesse Jackson to Jesse James. What's that line from that T.S. Eliot poem about Prufrock? He said he should have been "ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas." For some reason Herald reporter Dan Christensen reminds me of that line. He just keeps scuttling on stories that are extremely important but have about as much sex appeal to them as Ben Stein. And he's a helluva reporter. His work with Patrick Danner about improperly sealed Broward County court cases is paying off. This stuff cuts to the core of what America is -- and what it's supposed to be.Yorston The Palm Beach Post weighed in with a story by Rani Gupta about a so-called genius kid who hacked into several schools' computers to change grades and monitor e-mails. 18-year-old Jeff Yorston was charged with a felony -- and is expected to join the Bush Administration shortly after graduation.  And the Sentinel, ah, the lovely Sentinel. John Holland had a good story about the elaborate, and yet quite clumsy, scam that is the City of Hollywood. It's about the fraudulent CRA and the city's attempt to take the Mach family property for use by private developers. I don't know, but I heard that some big news is coming down on Keith Wasserstrom, who has long been under investigation by the State Attorney's Office for his role in the Great Sewer Stink. We'll see.
