I'd like a neutral 3rd party to mediate this. Coptic101 is a good faith editor, who was badly effected by the event the article is about. He or she is a highly valued Wikipedian in that he or she speaks both Arabic and English fluently. He or she also seems willing to work with the community to try to resolve conflicts. He or she is however new to wikipedia and still struggling to fit in, does not understand WP:COI, WP:RS, or WP:OWNERSHIP. Lihaas is more experienced and is trying to do some WP:NPOV work and some copy editing. Maybe Lihaas has been rude to Coptic101, I'll leave that up to you. Thank you much! Tim.thelion (talk) 02:49, 6 January 2011 (UTC)WHAT? I have had NO WAR with coptic whatsoever, he reverted me i walked away from that page. the admin on the edit war page that i reported with an ip said it was NOT A war with the IP so i returned. You can see his talk page that MANY other editors warned his "npov"you can also note, that coptic correspondence with me entailed "Please next time before making nonsense edits like this one" that is civil and IM being rude? Im ultimately baffled by this sulkign to the admins from an editor who also recommended it should be page protected when i posted on that page!lets not forget that weve tried to explained to him the concepts to read and it doesnt matter to him. (a possible sock)But of course now the admins will resort to a 1-sided block. (Lihaas (talk) 03:48, 6 January 2011 (UTC)).No where in this did I sugest you be blocked or say anything against you. Indeed, that's not what this page is for. At the top of the page it reads "Avoid filing a report if: You want blocks, bans, or binding disciplinary measures to be imposed/enforced." I just asked for a neutral 3rd party. Though I'm really not convinced you where polite when you posted this to my talk page. Tim.thelion (talk) 03:53, 6 January 2011 (UTC)[edit] Alexandria bombingPlease next time before making nonsense edits like this one [1], make sure you have consensus from the other editors to change the structure of the whole article like you did. --Coptic101 (talk) 00:48, 6 January 2011 (UTC)Please see Talk:2011 Alexandria bombing. --Coptic101 (talk) 01:44, 6 January 2011 (UTC)Please see Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#Coptic101_and_Lihaas Tim.thelion (talk) 02:51, 6 January 2011 (UTC)[edit] copticWHAT? he has warnings and wars with numerous editos that you can see on his talk page, he probably socked- i DID NOT war with him and refrained from that page. on WHAT BASIS IS THERE A COMPLAINT ON THIS??(Lihaas (talk) 03:44, 6 January 2011 (UTC)).I didn't accuse you of anything. I simply listed you as a party. Please stay calm. Everything will be allright. Your reputation isn't ruined forever. Tim.thelion (talk) 03:48, 6 January 2011 (UTC)what is that if not an accusation? to go to the admins over waht? His response to me was an uncouth and uncivil accusation that i had "nonsense edits" with an IP that was warring with others and "im being uncivil" against etiquette? He has complaints and suggesting on bans from others and im in the wrong????(Lihaas (talk) 03:52, 6 January 2011 (UTC)).[edit] Old June 3rd is President's Day, America!Today is Monday, 10 January 2011, and the current time is 04:14(UTC/GMT).

As if the Middle East is not bad enough now the irish republicans seems to be patrolling their petpages.There is a Christian terrorism, Islamic terrorism but no Jewish terrorism (and this Sikh terrorism) then there's an American state terrorism but Israeli state terrorism. Fair enough, but i tried adding the USS Liberty to Zionist political violence and guess what...?i think wikipedia's time has come. it did its duty, and did it well for a long time but now its better for more subject focused "pedias." Love to see how a "political" one comes along. Maybe starting a "Terrorpedia" could be a good idea.; Lihaas 2Attention: This request may be declined without further action if insufficient or unclear information is provided in the "Request" section below.Request concerning LihaasUser requesting enforcementO Fenian (talk) 06:17, 21 April 2010 (UTC)User against whom enforcement is requestedLihaas (talk  contribs  deleted contribs  logs  edit filter log  block user  block log)Sanction or remedy that this user violatedWikipedia:Requests for arbitration/The Troubles#Final remedies for AE caseDiffs of edits that violate this sanction or remedy, and an explanation how these edits violate it[60] First revert[61] Second revert, less than 24 hours after the firstDiffs of notifications or of prior warnings against the conduct objected to (if required)Not applicable, has just been blocked under this sanctionEnforcement action requested (block, topic ban or other sanction)BlockAdditional comments by editor filing complaintThe IP editor is plainly Lihaas, given the edit to to the article and continuing the same discussion on the talk page, he is also participating in the same discussion as the account on Talk:Tapuah junction stabbing. Northern Cyprus presidential election, 2010 is another article common to both the IP and the account as well. I do not believe it should be necessary for me to file a WP:SPI first given they are plainly the same? Note that the "source" he has added is this, which only describes Rebublican Action Against Drugs as a "vigilante organisation" and does not use the word terrorism as required. This is the second time in a matter of days Lihaas has violated the sanction on this article, the report right above this one was his first violation. O Fenian (talk) 06:17, 21 April 2010 (UTC)Notification of the user against whom enforcement is requested[62]Discussion concerning LihaasStatement by Lihaasif one sees the discussion on the talk page for List of terrorist incidents, 2010#criteria for inclusions I have asked O Fenian for a debate where he refuses to debate the issue at hand but simply states: "This is not a list of bombings, so please do not add bombings..." + "If your only argument is that you intend to "ignore all rules" then this discussion is pointless" + "You either provide a source that describes the incident as terrorism, or it does not get added to the list." He then resorts to the tried and tested method of tag-team revertin with the user RepublicanJacobite from the the irish republican wikiproject (of which the two did the same on the RIRA/CIRA articles last year to remove the sources quotations from the IMC report of the time). On another issue on the page I had an issue with the addition of the Tapuah Junction stabbing incident which another editor added because wikipedia calls for editors to be WP:Bold. I'm currently in the process of debating with another editor why i think it is wrong to add and why he thinks it is right, as the onus is on me to challenge the info was agreeably left on the page till consensus. Then another editor comes along and adds this edit in question about RAAD, the 2 republican members seem to so politically charged that they dont want to discuss the issue or the criteria for inclusion (in general as per the topic of the debate) and refuse to discuss this but simply state the onus turns on us again. I have said it before in the debate that i agree there is stuff that shouldn't be on here but let's debate a criteria, yet they seem to think it is absolutely there preregotive to decide on an issue that suits them with scant regard for the talk facility. What is the point of a talk facility if political agendas have it there way without willingness to discuss? Even the hot-bed of the Middle East conflict is at least willing to discuss in the Jewish Exodus from Arab lands. Im not saying im right, im just saying have a debate fairly before removing. Then get consensus. Wikipedia explicity asked an editor to be bold and they remove without discussing it with anyone. Might as well get rid of all these rules then. (of which, btw WP:Ignore also states that rules dont have to be followed by the book, meaning WP:WTA has repercussions. Furthermore, another editor has also said how the list of terrorist incidents is unrelated to the troubles and that every act of terror/political violence in N. Ireland is not related to the troubles.Lihaas (talk) 09:02, 23 April 2010 (UTC)As for his latest "blatant lie" he has used the talk page as a forum rather than discussion. i have listed what he said and refused to discuss. Talk page doesnt mean using it for the sake of it, its to be used for discussion of content not threats.as for "edit summary of vandalism -- watch what you delete" if you read the edit you will find the edit removed undisputed info apart from the controvesy. go on and see how the dates of another entry were reverted, mind you without any edit summary whatsoever. At any rate, pending the outcome of this case i have not gone back and reverted. But then there is the other precedence for being WP:Bold in reverting other controversial additions like that of the Tapuah junction. if one wants to read/follow the debate in this regard i have postedon the talk page without reverting. the onus now falls on O Fenian to debate.He now seems to say, after i have given an arguement with basis, that he doesnt want to debate because he seems to have changed his mind "This is becoming little more than trolling now. Unless reliable sources describe this incident as terrorism, or the perpetrators as terrorists, Wikipedia will not be doing so." Now i would like to ask an admin. Why should i have to keep justifying myself if he refuses to talk and debate?There seems to be a new red herring to avoid debate. "finding it difficult to believe that straight after a block for a 1RR breach, an editor can breach 1RR again on the same article using a sockpuppet, continue edit warring after that" firstly, 2 editors vs. one finds this article is not related to the troubles so there is a 3rr rule. Secondly, i have ceased to remove his edit awaiting the setting of precedent. Thirdly, there is no "sockpuppet," which he seems to believe is the only reason to argue about.Sockpuppet caseWhy would i possible want to log out and log back in just to edit this? That to somethign that is blatantly similiar? If i was a sock puppet woudlnt i at least try to be different? My account seems to often log out on some comps im on b/c its a public facility or has low cache memory. i dont know what the reason is.Lihaas (talk) 09:05, 23 April 2010 (UTC)previous blockon what basis was this? on the whim of 1 person? No others, no other admins. Is this a politically driven wikipedia that 1 person can make demands have it passed? Simply because he asserts a relation with the troubles doesnt make it true? Mr. O Fenian is not a historian by an qualification not a policy maker nor a wikipedia admin/rule maker. as above, 2 editors on the issue have shown this to be otherwise. Why is there no apology for the block? And as shown above the second "revert" adds another source to work through consensus, yet for some reason wikipedia seems to believe that only those who update regularly have the authority to make demands on others.Lihaas (talk) 10:57, 23 April 2010 (UTC)Hi Lihaas, the block was on the basis of this remedy, which clearly states that editors who exceed 1RR "may be blocked without warning by any uninvolved administrator". The remedy has the scope of "any article that could be reasonably construed as being related to The Troubles, Irish nationalism, and British nationalism in relation to Ireland", and I consider the Republican organization is related to Irish nationalism. PhilKnight (talk) 14:44, 23 April 2010 (UTC)You said "any article that could be reasonably construed..." yet i didnt edit RAAD (even if it were to construed as a time of the troubles (as per the above not everything in the country has to do with the troubles), even though the topic on hand concerns actions in 2010). The article in questions is List of terrorist incidents, 2010. Seeing that page there are only a few facets that even consider ireland as a whole.Furthermore, the RAAD page itself was created only lastmonth in response to action this year, long after the troubles were done with. Yes the remedy ties me up to the troubles which i havent even touched in a yearYou can also see the tag-team revert editors supporting each other (the only this RepublicanJacobite seems to want to discuss. very likely to be a case of sockpuppetry)Talk:List_of_terrorist_incidents,_2010#Arbitrary_breakAnd i do all the admins actually read the content before replying? (See tim songs update below after i posted)also, and more importantly, the block came from a "revert" that included lots of info. not just his that was another "revert" in less than 24 hours. see the previous info above. Didnt the admin who did the block actually read the info? Lihaas (talk) 03:46, 24 April 2010 (UTC)Comments by others about the request concerning LihaasComment I think invoking AE is an unnecessary escalation of what has been a fairly slow-burn, civil discussion, albeit mostly carried out by edit summary, the more unfortunately. Firstly, I don't think this is a Troubles related incident, simply a vanilla question of whether a violent act by a vigilante group can be construed as terrorism. Not all terrorism in Ireland is by definition part of the Troubles. Secondly, the second "revert" diff linked by O Fenian above represents what appears to be a good faith effort to make a real substantive change to meet O Fenian et al's concerns by adding a new source on the issue. I oppose any blocks at this time as unduly chilling on the necessary give-and-take we're having on this list and related articles. (please see also my comments at the SPI case). RayTalk 18:59, 21 April 2010 (UTC)Considering Lihaas is once again adding the incident which is unsourced as terrorism with an edit summary of vandalism -- watch what you delete I would request that a sanction (or sanctions) of some description is/are issued. Thank you. O Fenian (talk) 07:19, 23 April 2010 (UTC)Further accusation of vandalism, and also a blatant lie that "Time and time again you have refused to use the talk facility", when I have posted on the talk page repeatedly. A block at this stage would not be punitive, it would prevent him edit-warring to add back the incident which is unsourced as terrorism, since he shows no sign of stopping. O Fenian (talk) 09:00, 23 April 2010 (UTC)I am finding it difficult to believe that straight after a block for a 1RR breach, an editor can breach 1RR again on the same article using a sockpuppet, continue edit warring after that, make accusations of vandalism, and that nothing is going to happen about this? When will it end? O Fenian (talk) 09:11, 23 April 2010 (UTC)To repeat myself, I don't think this falls under the arbitration case for the Troubles; Lihaas' problem here has nothing to do with Irish nationalism, and I've yet to see a serious argument that this incident springs from that. In which case what we have is a fairly frustrating and annoying content dispute, where I do think Lihaas is being a little bit unreasonable, but unreasonableness is not yet a reason for banning. RayTalk 04:06, 24 April 2010 (UTC)Comment From my uninvolved view with this current issue. I have dealt with O Fenian before and I noticed from his comment of complaining about accusations of vandalism, this reminds me of a certain accusation here where he falsely accused me of vandalism while I attempted to fix an infobox which I was only able to do poorly due to template problems. Hypocrisy? The C of E. God Save The Queen! (talk) 17:15, 23 April 2010 (UTC)As anyone can see, that (which is not caused by any since-deleted templates) is a joke, and that any editor knowingly saw fit to leave an infobox in that state and not self-revert their edit is vandalism in my opinion. O Fenian (talk) 17:20, 23 April 2010 (UTC)I was trying to remove a flag that does not represent the whole of Ireland and due to there being no template to have it say "Ireland" without a flag, that was all I could do with the templates avaliable which is not vandalism. The C of E. God Save The Queen! (talk) 17:35, 23 April 2010 (UTC)Could I suggest you discontinue this thread? PhilKnight (talk) 18:14, 23 April 2010 (UTC)The point I was making is that O Fenian's motives may be questionable with the source I gave that suggests there may be some hypocrisy which makes one of his explainations suspicious. The C of E. God Save The Queen! (talk) 18:29, 23 April 2010 (UTC)Result concerning LihaasThis section is to be edited only by uninvolved administrators. Comments by others will be moved to the section above.As the IP user was not evading a block, it would seem to me that the appropriate venue for this request is WP:SPI, where you can raise a type A checkuser request. Stifle (talk) 10:58, 21 April 2010 (UTC)User:O Fenian has asked me to review this decision as he feels it is obvious that the user is Lihaas. I do not believe further action is appropriate here but am leaving the request open for other admins if they think differently. Stifle (talk) 11:19, 21 April 2010 (UTC)The IP edits the same articles, at similar times, but never at the same time, so it certainly could be a sock. Given that Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Lihaas has already been filed, I'll wait for the result. PhilKnight (talk) 16:58, 21 April 2010 (UTC)I've declined the CU request, as it is definitely the same user. Someone here should figure out if any sanction is necessary. Tim Song (talk) 18:55, 21 April 2010 (UTC)SPI has kicked it back to us. I am inclined to closed this with no action per Ray above, as blocks are supposed to be preventative rather than punitive. Stifle (talk) 19:17, 21 April 2010 (UTC)Question: Have all those accounts which violated an arbitration decision been blocked? If any remain free to edit, I disagree that they should go unsanctioned. Of course, if all accounts associated with this request have been blocked for sockpuppetry by the folks at SPI then applying a sanction would be needless. AGK 16:57, 22 April 2010 (UTC)Hi AGK, my understanding is there was an infringement, but Lihaas hasn't been blocked. I agree a short block could be appropriate. PhilKnight (talk) 21:37, 22 April 2010 (UTC)Thanks for clearing that up. Any block should be accompanied with a notice that further violations will result in an extended block and/or a ban from the topic area. This sort of problem editor can quickly escalate from being a small pain in the rear to being a major obstacle to collaboration and discussion. I do, however, hesitate at blocking now for the two reverts because of the time that has elapsed since the incident. On the other hand, a block may a good idea in light of the sock puppetry. AGK 23:00, 22 April 2010 (UTC)Should we be kicking Lihaas out of this subject area permanently, in light of the sock puppetry? People who use alternative accounts to avoid scrutiny and push through their POV aren't the kind of people we need floating around contested, ex-arbitration subject areas. AGK 23:06, 22 April 2010 (UTC)My feeling, as above, is that blocks are meant to be preventative rather than punitive and it would do no good to block him at this stage. Stifle (talk) 08:16, 23 April 2010 (UTC)What about a restriction that he may only edit while logged in? Any future failure to log in that is not immediately corrected will result in a block. Tim Song (talk) 20:09, 23 April 2010 (UTC)Stifle: Blocks are meant to be immediately preventative, yes, but I'm talking about sanctioning him. The preventative element of a sanction needs to be considered on a more long-term basisso even if he isn't currently a "threat", it may be the case that his presence in this subject area is detrimental.Tim Song: I don't think that's necessary. We usually deal with sock puppets by slamming an indef on the puppet/s and a lengthy block or indef on the master. I'm also not seeing any remedy in the The Troubles case that would allow us to levy such a sanction even if we wanted to. Maybe a community one-account restriction could be agreed to at AN/I, but againI don't agree that it's necessary.

With three more days until the book burning is to take place I can only see this story moving in one direction. __meco (talk) 21:42, 8 September 2010 (UTC)Only if something massive happens in retaliation, which I doubt. This is so much of a non-issue that I'm really disappointed that world leaders have given it so much attention. If they hadn't said jack, no one would care. --Golbez (talk) 21:45, 8 September 2010 (UTC)*sigh* Again we have an editor who opines on what should be featured based on how the world ought to react to a would-be non-event simply blocking out the fact that the world is rising up in uproar. This is becoming a trend. This is no way to administer In The News... __meco (talk) 21:50, 8 September 2010 (UTC)I'm not sure what your statement here is; "to a would-be non-event"? Yes, it's a non-event unless an event happens. The burning of a book is not typically an event. A bombing in retaliation is an event, but people opining about a non-event is, in itself, a non-event. --Golbez (talk) 21:53, 8 September 2010 (UTC)Put another way, the story some tim ago was not the cartoons of Muhammad - it was the violent reaction to them. It is premature to consider putting this up unless there's an actual reaction to it. Burning a commonly available item is not really ITN worthy, no matter how many news sources and famous people pipe up about it. --Golbez (talk) 21:58, 8 September 2010 (UTC)Oppose I don't really see why these far right nutters burning the Koran deserve the publicity. -- Eraserhead1 <talk> 21:56, 8 September 2010 (UTC)Oppose per Eraserhead1. --Mkativerata (talk) 21:57, 8 September 2010 (UTC)Strong oppose and article should be nuked as well.

SpencerTC 00:02, 9 September 2010 (UTC)Nominator's rationale is convincing; opposition based on desire to deny publicity is less so. The amount of attention this is getting worldwide is undeniable. However I feel it does not belong on ITN until after it has occurred and we see how people have reacted. The Hero of This Nation (talk) 01:20, 9 September 2010 (UTC)Event is obviously "a story of international importance or interest" [67]. However, the blurb will look pretty boring at the moment, "...world leaders condemn FL church's plan to burn a Quran...", so I say Wait till the actual event, after which it will definitely be notable (even if, say, the event is cancelled). SPat talk 01:49, 9 September 2010 (UTC)Cancellation of the event would not be notable in the slightest. "Preacher says he won't burn Qu'ran on Saturday" is not really encyclopedic material. I can see scenarios where the event could become notable, but they haven't happened yet (and, as they would almost inevitably result in significant loss of human life, I hope they don't). Physchim62 (talk) 02:14, 9 September 2010 (UTC)oppose this making on ITN would only have shock value to it. not much encyclopedic value. all these made up days like lets draw muhamad or lets burn qu'ran are quite stupid and really should not be featured on Main page unless someone like Obama personally does it himself on TV. which causes international panic or smth -- Ashish-g55 02:26, 9 September 2010 (UTC)Oppose, for reasons already stated by others. Nightw 07:03, 9 September 2010 (UTC)What the hell? This is a huge story in the international press. The coverage is unjustified for this little man but we can not decide what is and is not a major international story, to ignore it in order to avoid controversy is censorship. This has been responded to by senior politicians, religious figures, senior military, countries are seeking to block coverage of it. It is incredible people are trying to suggest this should not be mentioned on the main page. The media has been banging on about it for the past 24 hours. BritishWatcher (talk) 09:53, 9 September 2010 (UTC)*Responded to. Seeking to. Words. Nothing more. Get back to me when there's an actual action; violence, certainly, or maybe even some Elian-esque raid to stop the eeevil church from doing something that isn't illegal (apart from the fine for having a fire in their county). --Golbez (talk) 13:42, 9 September 2010 (UTC)Support - this is an incredibly notable international event (i agree that it shouldnt be, But it is). Of course it should be added to ITN. Although it should only be added once the silly deletion attempt of the article has failed. BritishWatcher (talk) 09:57, 9 September 2010 (UTC)*People condemn an awful lot of stupid plans, which doesn't always make those plans significant; indeed, there's no end of cases of plans so trivial they didn't even exist being publicly condemned at great length for a couple of days! I don't see much reason to give this more publicity; it's one person being a dick by making a small but puerile gesture, and hoping people jump in response. Shimgray | talk | 12:07, 9 September 2010 (UTC)*If you have updated yourself on the international news coverage of this issue you will also have ascertained that the whole world is indeed jumping. That is notable. Then it matters less why they are jumping. __meco (talk) 12:55, 9 September 2010 (UTC)**No, it means a lot of highly paid people are overpaid and underworked. You haven't even proposed a blurb; "Many people say that a group of people shouldn't damage its property"? --Golbez (talk) 13:42, 9 September 2010 (UTC)*Now you are just talking garbage. So now the lack of a proposed nlurb is also an argument against this story reaching ITN? Have you no filters between what enters you mind and what comes out? __meco (talk) 13:50, 9 September 2010 (UTC)*Well that's twice you've insulted me, to zero times me insulting you, but whatever makes you feel better about nominating this. And no, a blurb is not required to get it put up - but it helps. No, the argument against it reaching ITN is that it's a non-event, and that I choose not to publish it. --Golbez (talk) 14:10, 9 September 2010 (UTC)Please dont use bullets and tabs. it looks odd -- Ashish-g55 13:56, 9 September 2010 (UTC)====Australian federal election, 2010====Within the next 90 minutes we will know who will form government in Australia.

They are perceived as being far-right by many in Sweden and the relatively benign term 'nationalist' glosses over this, as well as obscuring the fact that many active in the party are formerly active neo-Nazis. Is wikipedia just going to go along with this party's attempts to airbrush these things out?90.233.176.63 (talk) 13:02, 20 September 2010 (UTC)I think the term "nationalist" has a negative connotation when it describes political parties.Eiad77 (talk) 22:26, 20 September 2010 (UTC)It does seem to be the term used in the article itself; I'm not sure we should be second-guessing that, and we don't have the space to give a detailed summary of their positions. Shimgray | talk | 18:29, 20 September 2010 (UTC)I did a review of sources (not just the ones in the article) and "nationalist" appears to be widely used. --Mkativerata (talk) 21:51, 20 September 2010 (UTC)Yes the term 'nationalist' has come to be widely used about the Sweden Democrats but that is mainly a testament to how successfully the party has succeeded in re-branding itself over the last decade. It's true that it has a negative connotation, but what I think this creates the impression they are something akin to Sinn Fein in Ireland or the EAJ in the Basque country or something, when in fact they belong in a category with the Front National in France, Vlaams Belang in Belgium or the Freedom Party in Austria (if they still exist) in that they are mainly concerned with anti-immigrantion politics and not really nationalism. Anyway, never mind it seems to have reached consensus but still it's a shame Preceding unsigned comment added by 90.233.134.29 (talk) 23:58, 20 September 2010 (UTC)To be honest, unless I'm explicitly in a context where I expect to be discussing someone like the Scottish Nationalists (a lefty independence-oriented party), I read "nationalist" and presume "scary right-wing person". I think we may just be differing here on the implications we attach to the word! Shimgray | talk | 00:38, 21 September 2010 (UTC)Besides how to describe this party, it is still a problem that they are said to "hold the balance of power". Similar wording is in fact used by some media, but it means absolutely nothing. The issue is that the Alliance probably will need a few votes from someone else to have an absolute majority, and Sverigesdemokraterne is just one possibility, and in fact the least realistic one - as Alliancen explicitly and repeatedly rules it out. Theoretically, if all the other parties choose to ally themselves with Sverigesdemokraterne against Alliancen, they would have a majority, and in that sense Svreigesdemokraterne hold the balance, i.e., thay can choose between a government involving the social democrats or one involving Moderaterna (Alliancen) - but this is a wildly unrealistc speculation as neither side wants to work with them. Here is a proposed wording of the item:In the Swedish general election, the centre-right Alliance wins a plurality but not an absolute majority. The nationalist Sweden Democrats for the first time wins a basis in the Swedish parliament.--N (talk) 07:20, 21 September 2010 (UTC)Parts of this seems best. "In the Swedish general election, the centre-right Alliance wins a plurality. The nationalist Sweden Democrats for the first time wins seats in the Swedish parliament." no need to say "no a majority" its implied. I dont any cover is needed for the SD to feature at all, but then historic fact should be mentioned (although with other elections we dont add which party made a first), and i dont think we mentioned the Lib-Dems as holding the balance of power during the brit elections.Lihaas (talk) 03:58, 20 September 2010 (UTC)Oppose I don't see any need for changes in the mainpage summary. The current situation is that Sweden has to be ruled by a minority government or form a majority that includes SD. Describing their position as one sitting on the balance of power seems like a very accurate description of the situation and the most common one as of now. Whether they actually get into government or not is a matter of speculation and won't be decided for quite some time.Peter Isotalo 14:32, 21 September 2010 (UTC)A main page link to a page that is locked and hence out-of-date? i see its unlocked.Furthermore, Jobbik's first entrance to parliament didnt go up on ITN Lihaas (talk) 03:58, 20 September 2010 (UTC)It really should be changed back to nationalist.Eiad77 (talk) 17:50, 22 September 2010 (UTC)This is rather old but I thought I should point out Peter's claim doesn't seem to be true since it's possible even if unlikely that the two coalitions could form a grand coalition and a majority government OR (again perhaps unlikely although from what I've read not impossible) that there could be a majority government involving various members of the current coalitions (I don't know what the coalition agreements are but I would presume it possible with the consensus of all involved) Nil Einne (talk) 10:50, 24 September 2010 (UTC)====Terror plot averted====* Drone attacks in Pakistan foil a Mumbai style attack on Europe.(Guardian), (Telegraph), (AFP)--Wikireader41 (talk) 01:01, 29 September 2010 (UTC)Oppose.

There's obviously no point, given the bizarre outcome of the recent poll on the talk page, but meh. It simply cannot be logically possible that Wikipedia considers the routine politics of a country like Kyrgyzstan is more worthy of notice to the front page readership than for example the first experimental observation of Hawking radiation, or any other item that just dissappears off this page for lack of affirmative action or even interest, whereas this election ticker stuff is given the red carpet treatment. I bet most readers have never even heard of Kyrgyzstan, let alone pick it out on a map, and anyone who have or could, will certainly know who Stephen Hawking is.

Unless you think talking about Hawking radiation is an example of 'catering to the lowest common denominator.' MickMacNee (talk) 16:37, 12 October 2010 (UTC)Well, that's what confused me. We can expect people to figure out what that is, but geography is apparently more difficult? I would wager more people have heard of Kyrgyzstan than of Hawking radiation. You just said we shouldn't include Kyrgyzstan because 'most people can't even pick it out on the map', but if I went outside right now and asked everyone I saw what they thought of Hawking radiation, they would not know what I was talking about. Same could apply to Kyrgyzstan. Which is why we don't do things here based on the Jaywalking test, we do them based on other factors. So my main complaint was your assertion that, because many people won't know what Kyrgyzstan is, based on that alone we shouldn't post it, when that ran counter to your example of Hawking radiation. You say it cannot be logically possible, I question your logic. --Golbez (talk) 16:41, 12 October 2010 (UTC)(And note that I'm not supporting this, while I would have supported Hawking radiation; however, I took issue with your statement) --Golbez (talk) 16:44, 12 October 2010 (UTC)My point is more accurately put as: Who has heard of Stephen Hawking/Kyrgyzstan, and who can place Kyrgyzstan on a map/tell you what Hawking radiation is.

(For what it's worth, I'd prefer we had posted Hawking radiation, too.) Nightstallion 08:05, 13 October 2010 (UTC)Comment: I'd like to point out that editors slapping random "strongest possible oppose" votes when they unadmittedly don't know anything about this item, and bringing up entirely unrelated items (i.e., Motor racing, Stephen Hawking) to cite as precedents for why this one should not be posted, is unproductive and incredibly juvenile. Get over it.For the uneducated, this is a remarkable election from a state that has been without a constitutional government for 6 months since a coup d'tat that we posted on ITN. That coup has been overturned by a democratic votethat's not "routine politics" by any definition.Regardless of any of that, the story is receiving wide international coverage and elections are on WP:ITN/R. So opposing is meaningless, unless there are any special considerations to take into account. In this case, as I said above, what should be considered is whether to post it now, or when a Prime Minister is re-elected. Until then, the interim government is still in power. Nightw 09:01, 13 October 2010 (UTC)You do know what the word 'futile' means right? I mean, I may or may not be 'uneducated', but I'm pretty sure I know my words and stuff. It's a protest vote, 'get over it'. MickMacNee (talk) 13:53, 13 October 2010 (UTC)My comment was not directed at you alone. But your "protest vote" was made with obviously no prior knowledge of the item in questionas you blindly argued that this was "routine politics"and was therefore ill-placed. Nightw 14:18, 13 October 2010 (UTC)I was aware of it, not least because it is in the nominator's rationale. But the fact of the matter is, we already posted the coup, and this blurb is still a routine election posting, coup or no coup, which is why everybody is invoking ITN/R. MickMacNee (talk) 17:07, 13 October 2010 (UTC)at least two of the above supports (as well as the one below) don't invoke ITN/R (and in my case I reject ITN/R for this item.) -- Eraserhead1 <talk> 21:13, 13 October 2010 (UTC)The article seems ready and there's plenty of support, plus its ITNR.

The biggest budget cuts in decades (edit: biggest since WWII), and the cutting of half a million jobs, is pretty noteworthy. (If a corporaton announced that many cuts, would we post that?). It's not just getting reported in the US (top of the NYTimes btw), it's also top story at Al Jazeera, reported in Le Monde and Toronto's Globe and Mail. If this happened in the US there would be overwhelming support. We've reported several domestic US stories, such as the Don't Ask... ruling. This seems to be notable enough.

The junta have stuck "Republic of the" at the beginning. It's not something I can get terribly excited about. TFOWR 21:21, 21 October 2010 (UTC)@TFOWR, quite. (edit conflict) If flag changes have precedence I'll Support that. -- Eraserhead1 <talk> 21:25, 21 October 2010 (UTC)Malawi changed its flag a few months ago with no and that got an ITN mention. Kevin McE (talk) 21:44, 21 October 2010 (UTC)I'm more sold on the flag change than the name change, but not by much. Check the comments at WP:ITNC for the Malawi flag change: it was posted because "the timer [was] turn[ing] red", Malawi's a "unanimously recognized nation", the article had been updated sufficiently, etc. (And compare the updates to Flag of Burma). If Flag of Burma was updated I'd consider supporting. I'd still oppose the "Republic of the" name change, however. TFOWR 21:53, 21 October 2010 (UTC)oppose I am not convinced we need to and TFOWR sums up my thoughts nicely The Resident Anthropologist (talk) 21:55, 21 October 2010 (UTC)Support Flag change. HTD (ITN: Where no updates but is stickied happens.) 02:53, 22 October 2010 (UTC)While this is the kind of thing that interests me, I wonder if it interests many of our other readers. There's a certain geek/cruft aspect to this. Certainly if France or Canada were to change its flag, there would be some reader interest, but I just don't think the BurMyanmarese flag is something that that many people would care about. -- Mwalcoff (talk) 03:02, 22 October 2010 (UTC)Flag of Malawi had a very noticeable spike when the flag change was on ITN. HTD (ITN: Where no updates but is stickied happens.) 03:31, 22 October 2010 (UTC)Support the changing of a national flag certainly seems newsworthy and encyclopedic to me. --PlasmaTwa2 03:05, 22 October 2010 (UTC) Administrator note: The article still needs to be updated. It looks to me as if it's getting shorter, not expanded, and the flag image seems to be a retrograde step as well... TFOWR 10:55, 22 October 2010 (UTC)I concur with TFOWR. There's next to no new material on the flag change apart from someone's personal observation that it looks a bit like Lithuania's. This can be posted when we have an update. HJMitchell | Penny for your thoughts? 12:38, 22 October 2010 (UTC)Oppose flag change, support name change, which I find is far more important than the flag. --Golbez (talk) 14:37, 22 October 2010 (UTC)Support. Flag change is very significant, and interesting too. Nightw 15:52, 22 October 2010 (UTC)Support It is not only a flag change, but name of the country and national anthem too.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 17:38, 22 October 2010 (UTC)support per encyclopedic value of the news. -- Ashish-g55 17:59, 22 October 2010 (UTC)Support. Historic national change. However, if Cyclone Giri is posted then we may end up having two simultaneous Myanmar/Burma related stories. The long-running article name dispute is irrelavent, and can be discussed in the meantime. ~AH1(TCU) 18:56, 22 October 2010 (UTC)Support precedent is Malawi.--Avala (talk) 23:19, 22 October 2010 (UTC) Administrator note: (Again) The article still needs an update. TFOWR 23:27, 22 October 2010 (UTC)There's a real dearth of good reliable references  BBC and CNN haven't even covered the change! I've updated the article as best I can with what I found. Strange Passerby (talk  c  status) 14:58, 23 October 2010 (UTC)Good enough for me - at least the image is of the correct flag now!;-) If you (or anyone) suggests a blurb I'll post it. TFOWR 15:12, 23 October 2010 (UTC)The government of Burma announces the adoption of a new flag (pictured), as well as changes to the country's official name and national anthem. Strange Passerby (talk  c  status) 15:22, 23 October 2010 (UTC)I suggest that we ASAP put this Burma story on the INT section as it will soon be an old story.--BabbaQ (talk) 16:23, 23 October 2010 (UTC)* Posted. I've left out the name change and national anthem as they're not mentioned anywhere in the Burma article, the Politics of Burma article or the Flag of Burma article. If someone wants to update one or other of the articles the blurb could be expanded. I've not done the image as I'm short on time and dropping by Wikipedia as time permits. It should be a good image, however - I can't see the Wikileaks story (current top ITN item) having any relevant image. TFOWR 16:40, 23 October 2010 (UTC)Wheres the prose precedence mandates:====World Gymnastics Championships ==== Have finished. Major sport in many countries, particularly former/communist and strong anti-communist nations eg US, S Korea, Japan YellowMonkey (new photo poll) 01:19, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Oppose. Not a major spectator sport, except during the Olympics. I recognize a lot of people like and/or participate in gymnastics, but we have to limit sports results to those that have the most interest. -- Mwalcoff (talk) 01:28, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Support if it is the highest level of gymnastics. Not really interested in gymnastics but can't think of any reason to leave it out completely, especially if it is followed in many countries. "Mitchell, Bouhail make gymnastics history" also sounds promising. --candlewicke 03:51, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Article--still needs a prose update. From where I'm sitting, Gymnastics is indeed a major sport in Russia, and several stars are household names. There's even a decent Russian Wikipedia article on it. However, I think in Russia the 2010 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships are bigger, and also going on right now.--Johnsemlak (talk) 06:49, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Rythmic Gymnastic championships finished on 26 September: not sure where that came from. Same editor got confused between the two different styles of Gymnastics last year, and ended up supporting this one then. Kevin McE (talk) 08:40, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Yeah, these different gymnastics types seem to be my bane. When I checked Russian media sites I saw headlines for Russia winning gold in Rhythmic Gymnastics and I assumed it had been recent. It is a big deal here--get's a bit more press that Artistic Gymnastics (or 'Sport Gymnastics' as the Russians call it.)--Johnsemlak (talk) 10:47, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Comment It was nominated last year and wasn't posted. There wasn't much (any?) support and the article wasn't satisfactory.--Johnsemlak (talk) 07:24, 25 October 2010 (UTC)The Rhythmic Championships were a month ago... Courcelles 08:15, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Whoops. Got the dates mixed up.--Johnsemlak (talk) 09:13, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Support Top level, genuinely international sport. Kevin McE (talk) 08:13, 25 October 2010 (UTC)I broadly support this event as per Kevin McE and YellowMonkey but recent precedent at ITN seems to not favor this kind of item. I'd point to the 2010 FIBA World Championship for Women and the 2010 FIVB Men's World Championship as similar examples--top competitions of sports with broad world-wide participation but limited media interest. Sporting events with less broad participation but strong media interest get more support here (I'm not necessarily criticizing that, though I would favor posting all the examples above). The current state of the article is also a prohibition, though fixable. In this case, it might be notable that the most prestigious gymnastics competition is really the Olympics.--Johnsemlak (talk) 14:51, 25 October 2010 (UTC)Support as the sport has a fanbase even in the US. Proposed blurb: Nergaal (talk) 04:46, 26 October 2010 (UTC)*China tops the medal table at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships **Prose added to All-around for mens and womens' team and individual. Can it be put up now? YellowMonkey (bananabucket!) 06:28, 26 October 2010 (UTC) **:Done Prose looks fine to me. Would be nice if the lead and background was longer but it's good enough. --Mkativerata (talk) 06:44, 26 October 2010 (UTC)[edit] The goodThe good of it:Talk:Proof that 22/7 exceeds [edit] awardThe Indian Barnstar of National MeritI hearby award Lihaas for his contributions to India content on Wikipedia ,especially regarding Lok Sabha consitutencies and to let him know that his contributions havent gone unnoticed.
