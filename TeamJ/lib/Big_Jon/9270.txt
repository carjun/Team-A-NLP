Look around your neighborhood and your city. Now imagine using that terrain to survive. Imagine dodging semi-automatic rifle fire as you scramble from cover to cover, dragging your wounded child behind you. Imagine the deafening report of a mortar as it strikes the ground a 150 feet in front of you, the overpressure enough to shatter your teeth and perforate an ear drum. Try and envision a Stryker rolling through neighbor's front lawn or a F/A-18 making lazy loops over your head in Close Air Support for the troops in the distance.Now with that vision in mind, stop by your local Marine Corps base, being they will be the first military units you'd face in an all out 'civil war' . Look at them for a moment, examine their 'work environment' . They're running the track, they're climbing ropes, they're grappelling with each other in mock hand-to-hand combat, and shooting targets while moving in raid lines on a daily basis. Nearly everyone on that base, down to our 'secretaries' has a combat award of one type or another, they've faced some of the most stressful situations on Earth where succumbing to the stress can get you killed, and they flourished.(snip)Now I 'd like to disperse a myth here - many of you think that US military would not fight civilians. I can't speak for all, but in my case - the moment you declare civil war, you're no longer civilians. The moment you attack the constitution, you're now enemies of that constitution. And I swore to defend and support and if necessary give my life for that Constitution and utilize every tool, technique, and weapon at my disposal to do so. And trust me, I'm not alone.I hope some of you heed my words and cool the rhetoric and focus on achieving your goals diplomatically instead of physically. It would never want to receive a frag order to Maryland, or North Dakota, or Texas, but it is an order I will follow no matter how much it pains me to do so.Whole thing: http://sealaskatimes.blogspot.com/2010/03/article-i-wis...

Any modern civil war will be one where guns, armaments and human soldiers will fight against technology, with the side that is the best educated and most sophisticated about advanced math and science and their power to change reality as we know it prevailing.A larger question would be whether the side that prevails decides to bring the other side back in and reform a union, kill all of the other side and repopulate their states with loyalists, or split up the country into new countries and let the defeated side have it's country.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topsulphurdunn      (929 posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 06:59 PMResponse to Reply #2324.That is exactly how civil wars are fought.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopRSillsbee      (524 posts)Sun Jan-09-11 08:14 PMResponse to Reply #2340.IMO in a real American civil warI doubt very seriously the rest of the world would sit back and let us fight it out and it is very likely that America would simply cease to exist Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopEFerrari      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 05:57 PMResponse to Original message8.Revolution and civil war are not synonymous terms. n/tPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopDainBramaged      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 06:02 PMResponse to Original message9.Yep, these play time soldiers would do well against the militaryIf they quit donuts for a year.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topspin      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:08 PMResponse to Original message11.Our opponents in Iraq and Afghanistan ...rarely engage our military in a fair fight.They seem to be able to successfully resist our power. Otherwise why are we still there?Our nation has spent billions of dollars training our military. Many retired soldiers still remember the lessons they learned while fighting in numerous hell holes all around the world. The training that these soldiers received while in the service is far superior to any training terrorists get in Pakistan or Somalia. The war would be another guerrilla conflict that would tear our country and its economy apart. The military might control the large urban areas, but these areas are very dependent on our transportation system to deliver daily supplies to keep the big cities functioning. Can you imagine the damage an ex seal team could do to our rail lines and freeways if they wanted to? Our power grid is also vulnerable to attack. A civil war or a revolt is something we better pray never happens. Fortunately our country has faced only one such serious war in its existence. The Union came damn close to losing that war with all its economic advantages and manpower. Had Robert E Lee decided to lure the Army of the Potomac to Gettysburg and then to swing around them and attack Washington, we might live in a divided nation today.Having said that, we are nowhere near the point that a revolution or civil war is required to preserve our freedom.  Any revolution that starts today will fail because it will lack the support of the majority of citizens in our nation, not because of the strength of our military. There are a lot of hot heads running around making noise in the media and on TV, but our political system is functioning just fine. The Republicans got booted out because they ran the country into the ground and the Democrats in office just learned a valuable lesson. They were sent to Washington to implement real change. So far the real change appears to be more of the same. The midterm elections should have taught our party that we need to at least try to live up to our promises if we want to retain power.

With red states and blue states prevalent today, a modern civil war will most probably again pit northern states against southern and interior western states, with the far west staying with the northern states.  Soldiers, except the most patriotic and honorable among them will end up fighting for their region instead of holding up a union, as was done during during the civil war.  There will be exceptions where a soldier or officer born and raised in one of the regions will end up fighting for the other side.AND.  The more technologically advanced of the sides will end up defeating the other side with advanced weapons as yet not in existence.  So comes the part where the rebels had need pray that they are fighting an organized government with leaders that are accountable to treaties that govern conduct in war.  Without the treaties restraining it's actions or concern for life restraining it's actions, the more advanced side can and may choose to exterminate the other side in combat and start over with a new society.  Given where talk of rebellion is coming from and the people calling for rebellion, it is doubtful that the more advanced side will be the rebel side.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topquaker bill      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 07:20 PMResponse to Reply #2028.Here is the problem with your notionAn armed insurrection will not be allowed last long enough to gain any momentum.

Civil war destroys money even faster because both sides are burning the opposite ends of the same pile. What is money really?  Most money that exists is not the green stuff you fold up in your pocket or wallet.  It is the reserved value of assets, stocks, bonds, real estate, business facilities and equipment, physical infrastructure.  This money exists in that we believe it does, because we believe these assets have real value.  In a civil war the asset value of property within and financial instruments tied to this country evaporates.  Properties, business facilities and equipment are destroyed, and the speculative value of any such investments vanishes.  Actual paper money itself could well become most valuable as a fuel used to stay warm in the winter, hyperinflation is common to economies angaged in active civil strife.There is nothing about either the Dems or Repugs that would suggest that either would long tolerate a circumstance that destroys money like a civil insurrection would.It will not happen, and if it attempts to start, the parties will unite for a bit simply to shut it down.  There is no point, and more importantly, no money in gaining control of an ash heap.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topkestrel91316      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 06:36 PMResponse to Original message21.Dear Sgt C: What you describe is the RW's wet dream.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopOld and In the Way      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 06:36 PMResponse to Original message22.The First Instance of organized, armed insurrection against the US...will be their last.Not only will they face the power of the US military, but they're going to find their civilian 'base' pretty much non-existent.

But that must be a minority of them.For those who say they have thought of leaving, I understand. If I was younger and my family didn't need me, I might try living somewhere else for a while. I personally know people who have left and found happiness elsewhere. Some in what we'd call social democracies but others in places less organized. They have friends in more than one country and could evacuate. Some years back I read a WSJ report about how the rich needed to buy land, grow crops, stockpile with food, medicine, equipment and ammunition. This is not that different than the 'patriot movement' with their fears of Doomsday. Believe me, they are buying up food and stockpiling. Other groups less political are forming communities and networking. It's almost like the old hippie commune movement of the past, but with a darker edge to it. There is a lot of fear around the world, but nowhere as much as here with our intense media environment. Are those fears justified or is the fear itself the real problem?I meet people from around the world everyday who are new to the  USA and love it here, while keeping in touch with their home countries. Most of us here have no family anywhere else. And many are aging and unable to move in any case.It seems that there are signs of all these things. I can only hope that those who say we create our own reality are correct. When I am having fearful thoughts, more things to fear arise. When I feel loving thoughts and confidence, I meet people who feel the same.And what we say and do in this political realm certainly affects us all, what we want to have happen, creates those self-fulfilling prophecies. Those who scream about the NWO seem to me, to be the ones, by investing their energy in that fear, will bring it to pass.Just a few thoughts.
