Giffords had been named as a political campaign target for conservatives in Novembers elections by former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin for her strong support of Obamas reforms. Palin had published a target map on her website using images of gun sights to identify 20 House Democrats, including Giffords, for backing the new health care law. At an event in 2009 which was similar to the one Giffords was holding today, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell to the supermarket floor.Giffords, who was born in Tucson and has two children, took office in January 2007 supporting immigration control, embryonic stem-cell research and the right to abortion. While the motive for todays shooting was not immediately clear, Giffords was one of 10 Democrat members of Congress who were the subject of harassment over their support for the healthcare overhaul. Although a Democrat, Giffords was a strong supporter of the right to bear arms and was re-elected to her third term last November in congressional elections, edging out the Tea Party favourite Jesse Kelly.http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/08/gabrielle-giffords-shot-tucson-arizonaWritten by My Name Is jack about 1 day ago.Hope the Congresswoman is okAs for Leal and his inane and irrelevant commentsGo have another drink dipshitWritten by Timothy Peter Leal about 1 day ago.Havent  had any alcohol in weeksI can KINDA thank you..

Jan Brewers office is confirming federal judge John Roll[nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in 1991 by Pres. Geo. H.W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1991] was among the dead.Sheriffs authorities said there were six dead, including a child, as well as 18 wounded.Giffords, who is in critical condition, is out of surgery at University Medical Center, said Dr. Peter Rhee at University Medical Center.The shooting occurred at a Safeway supermarket where Giffords was holding one of her regular Congress on Your Corner events, which allows her to speak directly with constituents in her district.The gunman has been identified as 22-year-old Jared Loughner, according to the Associated Press.Giffords has held several events since first taking office in January 2007. At one such event in 2009, a protester was removed by police when his pistol fell on the supermarket floor.This was her first event since her re-election to a third term in November.Giffords, 40, was talking to a couple in the store when a gunman rushed her, shouting as he fired his weapon.The gunman fired at people in line and got within 4 to 5 feet of the congresswoman, said Mark Kimble, a former Tucson newspaper executive who is now on her staff.The gunman fired at Giffords then ran out, continuing to shoot.Members of Giffords staff were among the wounded. District director Ron Barber remained in surgery, but his life was not expected to be in danger.Individuals at the event tackled the man after the shooting, said Pima County Sheriffs Department Bureau Chief Richard Kastigar.Last March, Giffords Tucson office was vandalized after the House vote overhauling the nations health care system.Giffords had just started the congressional session. She tweeted welcomes to new Republican congressman David Schweikert and had just sponsored legislation, with Republican Congressman Ron Paul, to cut congressional salaries.U.S. Congressman Raul Grijalva, Giffords seatmate from Southern Arizona, said, Its horrific. Its heartbreaking. Its very frightening. I hope she comes out of it. This is not what public service is all about.The heated rhetoric and civil discord creates an environment for something like this to happen.He lamented a series of incidents demonstrating the buildup that leads to something like this, including envelope of white powder sent to his Tucson office as well as a shot fired at his Yuma office.Gabbys contributions were all in the future. Her career was all in the future.Washington D.C. authorities have spoken with his staff to stay put.His family in Tucson now has security, but he doesnt know yet whether he will have a secret service detail in the future.http://azstarnet.com/news/local/article_88b4b436-1b53-11e0-8354-001cc4c002e0.htmlWritten by jamesb101 about 1 day ago.Wrong SE.I was in school at the time.The country was coming apart at the seems.Demos and the National Guard..The shooting was stunning.Absolutly stunning.I will never forget the girls fact looking back.With the body next to her..Written by Timothy Peter Leal about 1 day ago.the SUSPECTED shooter Jared Lee Loughner  had been through MEPSI tried telling Sam hopefully one day people will view the military in the same light they view the institution of SlaveryGotta look to see what kind of posts are written surrounding DARPA and this incidentWritten by jamesb101 about 1 day ago.TPL.clean it up..I mean it!Written by Daniel G. about 1 day ago.Quote by Timothy Peter Leal:She married Cmdr.

She also participated in a video teleconference  with intelligence officers in Afghanistan.As a member of the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees, I am briefed regularly by top officials from the Pentagon and State Department, Giffords said. But nothing is more valuable than hearing directly from the commanders on the front lines about ongoing operations and pending needs.The congresswomans visit to INSCOM comes on the heels of her recent congressional delegation trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan. She also recently received briefings at Luke Air Force base in Phoenix, Fort Bliss in Texas and the Defense Language Institute and Navy Postgraduate School in California.INSCOM soldiers and officers, who are trained at Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, provide critical intelligence support to national and military leaders Gen. Ray Odierno in Iraq and Gen. Stanley McChrystal in Afghanistan.
