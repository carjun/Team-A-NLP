Breaking News Facebook Says: "We're Not Shutting Down" Ends Dubious Rumor              MARCH 15, 2011 ANNOUNCED CLOSURE OF FACEBOOK: A FACT OR RUMOR?    Olongapo :  Philippines|Jan 09, 2011By dhreff        3 0     Views: 149      Only a few minutes ago, this writer discovered several news reports about closure of Facebook on March 15, 2011. If Facebook is a "money leviathan" or a "money making machine", why it is shutting down?  This writer prefers to wait for further development before putting light of truth to such reports. Mark ZuckerbergMark Zuckerberg was allegedly quoted, "it is stressful to manage". In corporate language, shutting down an entity is always associated with "bankcruptcy" which Facebook does not qualify in view of its acceptable descriptions. At this time, it is safer to regard the news reports of FB closure with a "grain of salt or soil which does not hold water". Hopefully, Mr. Mark Zuckerberg will issue a "certificate of bankcruptcy" to validate earlier reports. Otherwise, the smoke dissipates and fades away in the horizon.        1 of 55         Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg presents the latest mobile initiatives for his company at their Palo Alto      dhreff is based in Olongapo, Central Luzon, Philippines,and is Reporter for Allvoices Report Credibility           Share:                             Credibility      Reach             Global Reach This report's viewers come from the followingcountries:  United States of America (39.5%) Nigeria (15.1%) Philippines (14.3%) Singapore (5.9%) 9 other countries (18.5%)           READ MORE: March 15, 2011 FaceBook Shutting Down, Mark Zuckerberg, Philippines, olongapo, facebook, World Wide Web, Online social networking, business-news   More News From: Olongapo :  Philippines     Advertisement      Post a Comment Comments: 5            Reply  Posted By     stefance|about 14 hoursagono way. goldman-sachs has invested billions in the company, in the last two weeks. they dont do that for a company about the go under. zukerberg, however,is someone who could go under. he is a social virgin.

Reply  Posted By     itobin53|about 4 hoursagothere is a page on facebook that flat out denies this rumor. Talk of goldman sachs handling a pubic stock deal should scare everyone since they are admitted crooks from the mortgage scandal. If the stock deal goes through Wall street may have access to private facebook account info and THIS is the thing everyone should fear. The money-grubbing banks would happily sell private info right after they change the privacy agreement with lots of fine print no one will read.
