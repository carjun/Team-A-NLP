The royalty has no real power but are essentially servants of the country.  The Danes love their royal family and what they stand for.  They are modest people who want the best for all Danes and the royal family does their very best to represent Denmark around the world.  It might surprise you, but it would be no big deal to get rid of the constitutional monarchy in Denmark, except that the Danes adore their royal family.  In times where things change fast, the monarchy is a constant - a 1,000-year old tradition - something the Danish people can hold on to.  Unless the royal family decides to not serve the will of the Danish people, I think the constitutional monarchy in Denmark will continue for centuries to come.  Personally, I don't envy the royalty.  I wouldn't want to be exposed to the continued scrutiny which they are and know that just by being born your children will be public figure until you die.

House slaves may have loved their masters but that doesn't make slavery right.  Women may love their abusive husbands.  Children may love their abusive parents.  Most Germans, initially, loved Hitler.  None of it matters.  The concept, regardless of the practice, is wrong.  We all know the Danes have a wonderfully progressive country, little if no poverty, etc.  Doesn't matter.  Privilege by birth, whether formal or informal (as we have here in the U.S.) is wrong.  Doesn't matter if you think they do a good job "representing" Denmark around the world.  If you are representing a country as royalty, you are representing a country that retains an unjust institution that teaches people some are born better than others.  The concept is wrong and immoral.  There is no argument that makes it right.            edacelis: Who cares if the Danes love their royal family?

The royals aren't hording the public's money.  The democratically elected government of Denmark determines the royals' budget and it must be passed by a majority.  It works like any other government appropriation.  In other words, it is the will of the people.  If a majority of Danes no longer want constitutional monarchy, it would be easy to dismantle.  It would be a simple matter of passing a constitutional amendment to that effect.  The royal family has no political or real power.  Now, can you explain to me why Al Gore did not become president in 2000 even though he got the most votes?  Isn't America a democracy?  How come all votes don't carry the same weight?On another note, I think you're terribly wrong in trying to cast Denmark as a 'medieval' type country.  It is probably one of the most sophisticated, homogenous countries in the world today.
