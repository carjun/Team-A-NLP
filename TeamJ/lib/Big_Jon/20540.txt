I think the answer is pretty obvious. [the answer is yes] 2 days agoflag  reply-2ParatusGee, Obama selects William Daley, bank lobbyist and former JP Morgan Chase exec, as Chief of Staff and no one says anything but the best they can do with Boehner is a 15 year old something.  Forgive me if I don't fret.  Hell, Boehner could be the reincarnation of Marx, Hitler, Vlad the Impaler etc. and it would still be a step up from "Are you serious?" Pelosi. 3 days agoflag  reply0mitekillem  Paratus:...and why is that? 2 days agoflag  reply0BrushwithDeathToothpasteIt doesn't matter what people think of Boehner.  It only matters who they elect locally to go to Congress.  Rant about Boehner all you want.  Until people connect the dots on electing Tea Party candidates and the Republican party, we will constantly have people elected to public office who are committed to sabotaging it. 3 days agoflag  reply+1bike10Where is Rush on they crying of John Boehner and his cry fits? 3 days agoflag  reply+4jubalHe is a boner without a hole. 3 days agoflag  reply+3tverdellStop calling him Boner! 3 days agoflag  reply-2ayipisoh no!!! another call for a revolution..LOL 3 days agoflag  reply0BrushwithDeathToothpaste  ayipis:LOL 2 days agoflag  reply0disposablepeopleTHE DEFINATION OF A CRIMINAL !--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Date: 2010-12-29, 9:25PM EST--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE REAL CRIMINALS, ABC AND WCVB TV! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHEN TV REPORTERS , POLICE AND LAWYERS ARE THE CRIMINALS the public needs protection! THE DEFINATION OF A CRIMINAL IS; " ONE WHO KNOWINGLY HURTS AN INNOCENT PERSON(S) FOR PERSONAL GAIN AND PROFITS". THAT IS WHAT THE LAPD, ABC TV AND WCVB TV'S RON GOLLIBIN AND MIKE TIABBI, (NOW WITH DATELINE TV) DID TO ME WHEN THEY FALSELY ACCUSED ME ON NATIONAL TV OF BEING THE "HILLSIDE STRANGLER'! NONE OF THESE SO-CALED "INVESTIGATIVE REPORTERS" (O'RIELLY, JENNINGS, BROKAW ETC.) BOTHERED TO CHECK TO SEE IF THE ACCUSATIONS WERE TRUE BEFORE BROADCASTING THE LIES TO MILLIONS. NEVER LET THE FACTS GET IN THE WAY OF A SENSATIONAL AND PROFITABLE STORY! MY FAMILY TURNED TO OUR COUSIN ATTORNEY THOMAS MAY (NOW A BOSTON JUDGE) WHO WORKED FOR F. LEE BAILEY'S BOSTON LAW FIRM TO HELP US GET JUSTICE. ALBERT JOHNSON, WAS THE LAWYER FROM F. LEE BAILEY'S FIRM WHO VISITED ME IN THE LOS ANGELES JAIL WHERE I WAS BEING HELD FOR QUESTIONING FOR 4 DAYS. THE FIRST THING I SAID TO ATTORNEY JOHNSON WAS, "I WANT TO SUE THE LAPD FOR FALSE ARREST!" I REPEATED MY DESIRE TO SUE THE LAPD TO ATTORNEY JOHSON AND , MY COUSIN, ATTORNEY MAY. WHEN I WAS RELEASED FROM JAIL AND WENT BACK TO BOSTON. I WAS TOLD BY BOTH OF THEM THAT ,"WE WOULD DISCUSS SUING THE LAPD AFTER LABOR DAY (1978)". FOUR MONTHS LATER (AFTER LABOR DAY) I RETURNED TO F. LEE BAILEY'S OFFICES IN THE WEST END OF BOSTON AND WAS TOLD BY ATTORNEY'S JOHSON AND MAY THAT, "WE DON'T SUE COPS." I ALSO WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A 90 DAY TIME LIMIT TO SUE THE LAPD AND IT HAD EXPIRED! MY FAMILY AND I FELT BETRAYED BY F. LEE BAILEY'S LAWYERS AND ESPECIALLY HURT WHEN OUR OWN COUSIN, TOMMY MAY, FAILED TO INFORM US OF THE SUING DEADLINE AFTER MY MOTHER GAVE HER LIFE SAVINGS AND TRUST TO THEM. I lost my chance to SUE THE LAPD BUT I GOT ANOTHER LAWYER (AN HONEST ONE) AND SUED TV REPORTER, MIKE TIABBI , WCVB AND ABC TV, FOR LIBEL.DEFAMATION OF CHARACTER AND SLANDER. I WON A SETTLEMENT 10 YEARS LATER. IT TOOK ME 10 YEARS TO RECEIVE 1/10 OF WHAT WE ASKED FOR.( AND MY DESERVING AND LOYAL LAWYER GOT 1/3 OF THAT). ABC TV TOLD ME TO TAKE THEIR OFFER NOW OR THEY WOULD APPEAL AND DRAG OUT MY LAWSUIT FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS! I thought 10 years of my ruined life was worth more than WHAT THE OFFERED but I could not afford to keep my lawsuit going another 10 years. ABC and it's Boston affiliate WCVB TV made millions from their sensational accusations and on-air stories that I was the "Hillside Strangler" These untrue.stories increased their ratings/profits and the bottom line was " DON'T RUIN A GOOD, i.e. PROFITABLE STORY, BY CHECKING THE FACTS TO SEE IF THE JAILHOUSE ACCUSER WAS CREDITABLE; HURRY UP AND PRINT/BROADCAST THE UNPROVEN ACCUSATIONS TO GET A SCOOP, TO INCREASE RATINGS AND REVENUE AND LET THE LAWYERS WORRY ABOUT THE LAWSUITS LATER! THE PUBLIC NEEDS PROTECTION FROM THIS "UNHOLY ALLIANCE" OF THE MEDIA AND POLICE WHO RUIN INNOCENT "SUSPECTS" REPUTATIONS AND LIVES WITH FALSE (BUT PROFITABLE) ACCUSATIONS IN THE MEDIA ! I HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS TO GET A "NO-NAME LAW" PASSED IN THE US TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM FALSE ACCUSATIONS IN THE MEDIA. THIS FAIR LAW STATES "THE POLICE CANNOT REVEAL A SUSPECT'S IDENTITY TO THE MEDIA UNTIL THE SUSPECT' HAS BEEN LEGALLY CHARGED WITH A CRIME. " BECAUSE; ANYONE CAN ACCUSE ANYBODY, OF ANYTHING, AT ANYTIME AND MERE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD NOT BE "NEWS", NO MATTER HOW SENSATIONAL OR PROFITABLE! THERE SHOULD BE NO "DISPOSABLE PEOPLE " SHOWN ON TV TO ENHANCE THE POLICE'S IMAGE, MEDIA'S RATINGS AND PROFITS AND REPORTERS AND LAWYERS CAREERS! BUT; The MEDIA lobby's money always kills the "NO -NAME LAW" before it can pass because False Accusations are very PROFITABLE for the TV NETWORKS. MY TRUE STORY AND WHY I DON'T TRUST THE POLICE! WHEN THE LOS ANGELES POLICE ASKED ME TO HELP THEM SOLVE A CRIME I READILY AGREED AND STEPPED OUTSIDE. THEN THE LAPD DETECTIVE WAVED HIS ARM AND BOSTON TV REPORTER MIKE TABBI (NOW WITH NBC DATELINE TV) , WHO WAS HIDING IN THE BUSHES WITH HIS WCVB/ABC TV CREW, IMMEDIATELY JUMPED OUT AND PUT ME ON NATIONAL TV AS A "SUSPECT" IN THE HILLSIDE STRANGLER MURDERS. THE LAPD AND TIABBI DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO CHECK THE VALIDITY OF THE OUTRAGEOUS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME BY A JAILHOUSE INFORMER, WHOM THE BOSTON POLICE HAD CALLED A" PATHOLOGICAL LIAR" AND WHICH THE LAPD ADMIITED 4 DAYS LATER WERE NOT CREDIBLE. LAPD CHIEF DARREL GATES PUBLICILY APOLOGIZED TO ME FOR THE " MEDIA CIRCUS" (WHICH HE ALLOWED) AND HOPING "NO IRREPARABLE HARM WILL COME TO MR JONES AND HIS FAMILY." BUT IT WAS TOO LATE! MY LIFE AND CAREER WERE OVER AND I WAS "THE MOST HATED MAN IN AMERICA'! LATER THE LAPD INFORMED ME "VIGILANTES" WERE LOOKING TO HARM ME AND I SHOULD LEAVE LOS ANGELES IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THE LAPD COULD NOT GUARANTEE MY SAFETY! IT TOOK ME OVER 10 YEARS TO REBUILD MY LIFE IN ANOTHER STATE AND MY FAMILY AND I SUFFERED YEARS OF SUSPICION, HUMILIATION AND ABUSE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE LAPD WANTED TO LOOK GOOD ON TV AND AN AMBITIOUS, UNETHICAL REPORTER NAMED, MIKE TIABBI (NOW WITH NBC DATELINE), WANTED A BIG SCOOP TO FURTHER HIS REPUTATION AND TV CAREER TO MAKE MORE $$$ AND HIS EMPLOYER, ABC/WCVB-TV, WANTED TO GET HIGHER RATINGS! ( A ONE POINT HIGHER AUDIENCE RATING EQUALS ONE MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN PROFITS FROM ADVERTISING FEES.) MY LIFE, CAREER, REPUTATION AND DREAMS WERE SHATTERED BECAUSE A TV NETWORK AND AFFILIATE COMPANY WANTED TO SELL MORE PRODUCTS AND MAKE MORE MONEY. There should be NO DISPOSABLE PEOPLE to throw to the Media wolves by the POLICE! I HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS TO GET A "NO-NAME LAW" PASSED IN THE US TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM FALSE ACCUSATIONS IN THE MEDIA. THIS FAIR LAW STATES THE POLICE CANNOT REVEAL A SUSPECT'S IDENTITY TO THE MEDIA UNTIL THE "SUSPECT" HAS BEEN LEGALLY CHARGED WITH A CRIME! BECAUSE; ANYONE CAN ACCUSE ANYBODY, OF ANYTHING, AT ANYTIME AND MERE ACCUSATIONS SHOULD NOT BE "NEWS", NO MATTER HOW SENSATIONAL OR PROFITABLE! THERE SHOULD BE NO "DISPOSABLE PEOPLE " SHOWN ON TV TO ENHANCE THE POLICE'S IMAGE, MEDIA'S RATINGS AND PROFITS AND REPORTERS AND LAWYERS CAREERS! BUT; The MEDIA lobby's money always kills the "NO -NAME LAW" before it can pass because False Accusations are very PROFITABLE for their bosses! MY "HONEST' LAWYER, MARTY GIDEONESE of Harvard, AND I HAVE REPEATIVELY ASKED THE LAPD TO REOPEN THESE UNSOLVED MURDER CASES OF THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN WHO THE LAPD AND MIKE TIABBI SO QUICKLY AND PUBLICLY ACCUSED ME OF KILLING. AT THE TIME IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THESE COPYCAT " HILLSIDE STRANGLER" MURDERS MAY HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY LAPD OFFICERS. IS THAT THE REASON LAPD IS TRYING TO COVER THEM UP BY TELLING US "THE FILES WERE LOST IN THE EARTHQUAKE"?????????? DO YOU BELIEVE THE LOS ANGELES POLICE? Now the LAPD says it has solved one of the murders which they so quickly and publicly accused me of committing. But how can that be when the LAPD replied to my Freedom of Information Act request that ALL the records were "Lost in the Earthquake"? MAYBE NBC DATELINE SHOULD DO A STORY ABOUT THIS POLICE COVER-UP AND EXPOSE THE TRUTH! THIS IS MY TRUE STORY AND I WOULD LIKE TO GET CLOSURE ON THIS INJUSTICE BEFORE I DIE! (I am 70 years young.)

I think not, but your welcome to do what you want! 1 day agoflag  reply0disposablepeople  kennymotown:I just want to get a NO-NAME LAW passed to protect innocent people from the ambitious, unscupleous Mike tiabbis and many other TV reporters, so their lives and careers are not harmed by false accusations in the Media.Life is tough enough without innocent "suspects", and their families, having to survive the living nightmere of horrible unsubstantiated, false accusations broadcast to millions simply because some punk reporter wanted TV time to enhance his career and paycheck.PM Jones, VICTIMS OF MEDIA ABUSEPS, U mentioned Maryland as a possible state to pass a NO-Name Law; Why? 8 hours agoflag  reply+2kennymotownMatt Taibbi is on Olbermann's show right now and it will repeat at 8PM again. 3 days agoflag  reply+3FtheBULLSHTCan honest politicians survive in Washington? 3 days agoflag  reply0coxian_armada  FtheBULLSHT:Doubt it... 3 days agoflag  reply+5Incredulous" Voters are fatigued not only by the seemingly endless kinky-sex and corruption scandals emanating from Capitol Hill, but also by the increasingly infuriating fact that no matter which party is in power, the leadership inevitably borrows like dice addicts on the Vegas strip and uses the money to pay for huge Frankensteinian initiatives that bloat the size and power of the federal government, often without semblance of sense or plan. The underlying dynamic is bought-off congressmen ignoring real social problems and using the legislative process to construct massive perpetual handouts for their campaign-contributor sponsors. Both parties have now made the servicing of the giant handout machine their primary raison d'tre  and it's this perception, that Washington is occupied by an unbreakable bipartisan conspiracy of favor-churning hacks, that has inspired anti-Washington revolts like the Tea Party."I wonder if this is why Boehner is crying....because YIKES, the emperor is naked! 3 days agoflag  reply+3kennymotown  Incredulous:Very well said! 3 days agoflag  reply0jubal  Incredulous:Bonehead cries at the drop of the hat...and many people are really starting to take notice...people like my mother who is a fundie. 3 days agoflag  reply+5panicheadSome of Matt's best writing. Loved this story, laughed my ass of and have forwarded to about 7 friends to read and allready heard back from 2 that agree. I've been reading Matt's stuff since he wrote for the Exile (which he helped found) in Russian. He keeps getting better all the time at telling it like it is and being a real reporter that is really "true and balanced" and funny as hell. Nearerest to Dr. Thompson living today! 3 days agoflag  reply+3kennymotown  panichead:Yes he does have a knack for saying it like it is. I've seen him on Rachel's show and he does go after everybody D's and R's, whoever is wrong. He gets it, I just wish he could get through to more people! 3 days agoflag  reply+4ThatCrazyLibertarianI can't wait to see what Tabbi thinks of a JP Morgan exec being named as the new White House Chief of Staff.Boner just seems irrelevant today. 3 days agoflag  reply+4kennymotown  ThatCrazyLibertarian:Trust me Taibbi will do a story on that as well.

One of the first agenda's of the House by Republican's or as they should be called the Representatives of the ECONOMIC ROYALIST, is to make a big deal about repelling the Obama care bill. A huge waste of time that will not change anything for it will be shot down in the Senate or veto'd by the President! 3 days agoflag  reply+4oppressed1  kennymotown:Its going to be shot down, but most of them ran against the repeal of his law so they have to at least show the people they tried. 3 days agoflag  reply+4kennymotown  oppressed1:True story, but heres the kicker, the apathy of the 14 million people that voted in 2008 on the Democratic side because they didn't think Obama was getting things done they wanted is going to happen to the Tea Party folks in 2012. 3 days agoflag  reply0mitekillem  kennymotown:I think the Tea party will change it's name in 2012.
