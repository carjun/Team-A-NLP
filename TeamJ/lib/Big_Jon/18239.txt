Can you Focus those powers to create an event that will change your life? How do you use that focus to win, or to understand your place in your universe? Can your focus help you Just Know       the lottery numbers before they are drawn, or provide you with the confidence of just knowing       how to do something well, that you have never been trained in? Yes: Just believe.. In yourself, your knowledge, your heart and your mind. Focus on that belief.. It will surprise you. I once sat with a group of friends at my home waiting for the national weekly lottery to be drawn live on television. The prize pool had grown to the highest value ever and to us, as sociable kiwis; this was the perfect excuse to throw a 'pot-luck' dinner party preceding the event. Just prior to the drawing of the first ball in the Jackpot, someone suggested that we each guess our choice of individual numbers and continue to do so, prior to each ball being drawn. So we did. In that single focused two minutes; in sequence; 6 little numbers were drawn that completely changed my life.   I Wonder How I Knew That?How come I Just Knew That?At that time I didn't really understand the potential and relevance of actually picking 6 numbers in the correct sequence in regard to; the further development and reliance of that intuition, in bringing about future positive outcomes. It was not until years later that I found out how much your 'insight' relies on your overall positivity and attitude. Up until then I had only 'tested' or 'experimented' with my intuition.  From my 'self testing' came an understanding that I should Never question or doubt the sense at those times. It is a positive attribute that only seems to happen to me when I am positive and focused in myself. How strong is this sense that is either unwittingly or knowingly available; How important is being focused when it comes to achieving a particular desired result? Very. When you are positive in your outlook on life; you are open to all 'vibes' that come your way. You are also giving off positive vibes that others are open to, focusing is only a concentrated state of this. If you completely focus on the reasons why you are positive; others pick up on your 'vibes' and want to know you better. I personally find that if I want to achieve a particular goal; then I just have to 'Let the Goal Know' and visualise the result for the time that it takes to have the goal come to me. This is a very good exercise to practice with your pets as animals 'sense' more acutely than humans; which in itself should be asked Why, don't you think?  Of course if you are attempting to do this exercise with people, it will only work with people who are open to you; for example another positive minded person. A great deal of negative minded people are 'glued' to their negative perspective and allow that attitude completely undermine their self esteem to the point they gain most of their satisfaction from bringing others down. I try to avoid those ones as much as possible, as I find that such people seek out negative company. In saying this, I believe that there are two types of negative people; those who are not interested in changing their attitude and those who would change to become positive if they knew how to. I have found that this group really do have potential, when they make that change.

Do we have Intuititive Experiences to teach us? No .. I Do Not Believe Yes... I Believe So Undecided on this IssueSee results without votingAll Roads Lead to Rome:Are you blessed, cursed, starstruck or just lucky when your Intuition is at times so acute, that you Just Know              in advance, what is about to happen? Or are you merely in tune with your universe? This article covers intuitive steps or events. These are my steps and have sculptured my life: you are on a path for your life; our paths may be similar. Previously unnoticed steps have helped me understand and accept who I am to my universe; as opposed to what that universe represents to me the individual. Time has helped me gain the wisdom, to realistically believe that the steps over which I have passed, form the path that I am; by way of positive change within my universe; bound to follow, without fear; or reservation.  I believe that we all are directed to follow some predetermined set of challenges and experiences, so that we may be able to find our destinies and understand the soul within which drives and guides us to find; our home. Each step on our path carries a set of lessons, which may be learnt at the time, or at some future time in our journey. In that respect, intuition forms an integral part of knowing who we are, our potential and whom we will in time evolve to be. I am sharing my life experiences, so that I may illustrate to you, the benefits of striving to gain a point in your life where: You Just Know.   Perhaps that in itself is a step on our respective paths. If so, then it could be said that the steps beyond that point are those that do take us home; to our Rome. I have many more steps to follow and explore: Writing is one them. My life has been a lucky one that has taught me to love, to loose and to love again. It is a lucky life that has taught me to believe in myself and care the same way for others, along with trusting all the lessons. I am sure that our individual paths all converge over time and we may meet as kindred souls who will inevitably Just Know:              All roads lead to our 'Rome'. How many steps in our paths? I do know; but am sure that each step taken, also leads us to greater wisdom and inner tranquility. My step today is to write. It takes courage, honesty, belief and intuition to do so. Yesterday, writing was not a step that I had seen ahead of me. I do not know the expanses of this world; but I Just Know              that my path has lead me here to meet kindred souls, with greater skills. To a brighter place where collectively; we can help other travellers on their paths; believe and reach the potential within.  Do you Act On those Intuititive Experiences? No... Never Yes.. Sometimes Yes.. Always Try ToSee results without votingFollow the bouncing ball.When we take the time to review our lives; what is most apparent; is that there have been many key events and experiences that have had a very definitive relevance, in measuring our progress to our 'Rome.' Often the relevance of some events are so subtle, that they were, or remain unseen by us. If you analyse your life Positively and Objectively, you will find that you have actually learnt something very positive from the event. You may not however, previously realised the fact or gained an accurate understanding of why you have experienced the event.  Each positive lesson holds a major relevance overall to the unconscious bank of information that we accumulate, process and quite often misfile. We tend to think of that as being our 'experience' which of course it is, but it is far more valuable than to merely assign it to a file titled 'stuff I've done' as that tends to retard its 'real time' application. All information gathered can be said to be relevant to our future intuition folders, yet at times; is not identified as being only one part of two factors required for a task. In essence, we store fragments and live our lives not taking the time to 'defrag' our conscious mind, so that our unconscious mind can be programmed to operate at its fullest capacity. We are after all a computer with emotions, feelings and a memory capacity of an unknown size.   Some intuititive signs are so subtle that we walk right past them.Exploring an Intuititive event.By reviewing your life on a step by step basis, in say: 5 year blocks; you will find that It may not be until you have stumbled off your path, or something that at the time you considered to be a negative event; has provided you a positive lesson intuitively. It is generally not until you believe in yourself completely, that you can match the mental relevance. In The Power of Personal Objective Planning; by Pearldiver, a working exercise is provided to learn how to defrag your cerebral hard drive and to identify the relevance of those key events within your life to the objectives or goals that you have. In the next part of the Intuition series, I refer to an example of a major event in my life, which I did not appreciate as being a key turning point in my life. The event taught me several important lessons from that singular event, although at the time, I did not understand the whole relevance of it for years. When this event was analysed in a life review; I found that the key Lesson that the event taught me was: Trust and Believe that no matter what; you are Safe.

As a child I never did, now as an adult i try to.Pearldiver19 months ago Thank you Cashmere, this maybe more relevant for guys.  I think most of being a woman comes from inherited intuition.  Or maybe guys tend to be blind to it, until something like this occurs?BirteEdwards19 months ago Our rational society and world does not believe in intuition, and those of us listening to our intuition are often sneered at.As I was reading your article, a thought occured to me: All those great gadget we take for granted around us, were they brought about by scientific thinking or through the intuition of somebody? In this case it may have been something they thought about for quite some time, and then ... eureka.When we listen to our intuition, we should also at the same time listen to our mind. When the two work in tandem then extraordinary things happenPearldiver19 months ago You are completely right on all points (but you knew you would be) lol.  Thanks Birtie.Feline Prophet19 months ago Pearldiver, you've served up a gem! I would love to better my intuitive powers - looking forward to learning how to defrag my cerebral hard drive! :)dianacharles19 months ago I wonder if some of this comes from our left-brained, right brained way of thinking. I have found men being so logical and analytical that they scoff at women who might say that they can't quite put their finger on it, but they know that something is not so right there.I have quite often not gone with my intuition and then regretted it later.Pearldiver19 months ago Feline Prophet and Dianacharles thanks you are both right I believe.  I think some men are "frustrated by' a 'woman's intuition' not so much the act... more so the ability to act (on cue).. Luckily it is only '<some men>'Eaglekiwi19 months ago Throughly enjoyed reading this and a few light bulbs flashed in my mind ( eco friendly .of course ,lol) remembering how it must have been intuition that caused me to make several decisions ,which at the time I couldnt realistically explain. well done ,im off to read prt 2!Pearldiver19 months ago Thanks for enjoying this eaglekiwi.  Its amazing how often you don't make the connection. ripplemaker19 months ago Hi Pearldiver, I am a believer of intuition. And the more I acted upon it, the more sensing and responsive I grew to be. It brought me experiences both meaningful and beautiful and protected me in a lot of ways. I also came to see it as the voice of God which resides within all of us :-)So intuition tells me I have to keep on reading and learning more. :-) I will come back! Thumbs up!Pearldiver19 months ago Thank you Ripplemaker; of course you have the advantage as a woman, I believe.  Perhaps, my wonderment of intuitive events stems from being a man experiencing those things that we were taught men don't do. lol.  I really enjoyed my first cry as well.. Cheers for your positive comments here.mythbuster19 months ago Consider this bookmarked!

When I don't follow them I regret it.  I'll be reading these hubs and getting back to you.ThanksPearldiver19 months ago Thanks K Style  Yes they are.  Thanks for taking the time to read my works, Ill make sure you never regret that ... lol Moonchild6019 months ago Very nice Hub.  I read tarot cards and people call me an "intuitive" although I know we are ALL intuitive, I just am constantly aware of it and use it in conjunction with tarot cards.  They are my "tools".  But in addition to that, I know things from dreams and just "a feeling".  For example my friend may tell me she went on this great job interview and hopes she gets it and before she can finish telling me about it, I know she won't get it.  I don't tell her that of course, I have to tell her how happy I am and gosh, I hope she gets it or I come as being negative because as we all know, most people want to hear what will make them feel good, not the truth.  I had a friend telling me how upset she was about her relationship and I actually blurted out "What's the difference it'll be over within a year anyway and your going to be the one who leaves him"...she was shocked and didn't beleive me, but of course that is exactly what happened.   I often have to sensor my "intuitive feelings" so as not to upset others. Pearldiver18 months ago Thanks for reading this Moonchild60.  What you are saying is very true and I have found that 'intuitiveness' like this just happens when you are in a positive environment and are relaxed in yourself.  Yes I too have had to sensor feelings on numerous ocassions. Glad you enjoyed this.wordscribe4117 months ago Aha, so it is true.  That's funny you mentioned numbers, I have this uncanny ability with them.  For example, if I catch the lottery numbers being announced, I will more often than not know what the next number is:  I'll say:  "67".  And there it is, freaks out my kids.  Or, if there's a newstory, they will start to say the age of the person involved and I will say:  "32".  It's weird.  I have had a dream about a person involved in a motorcycle addident.  I was in high school at the time and shared the dream with the whole table, told where it took place (the exact intersection), etc...  I told my friend he'd better make sure he was wearing his helmet.  Sure enough, next day the accident happened where I said it would.  He called me from the nearest convenience store in utter awe and despair.  Great hub.  Thank you for reminding me about this important part of myself.  Still getting over the birthday thing.  Wow.Pearldiver17 months ago Hi Wordscribe42..Thanks for reading this and your comments. We (us both) share the same Life Numbers; which also reflects other things numberwise. Your friend was really lucky and it was a real plus; that you only dreamed about an addident instead of an accident; or the outcome could have been far worse..lol. I think many of us second guess intuition, perhaps because of the ways that intuitive events occur.Take care and of course: Happy Birthday.wordscribe4117 months ago Life numbers?  What does that mean?  Expand, por favor.wordscribe4117 months ago Okay, never mind.  We're 9's, right?  I googled it.  Read a description of a "9", fitting.  Very interesting.Pearldiver17 months ago Based on the date that you were born; we are given a sequence of numbers (our birth date +/- 9) these are referred to as life numbers, that remain constant key nos throughout our lives. Eg: your key lottery numbers would be 5 - 14 - 23 - 32 - 41 - 50 etc. Perhaps that is a secondary reason why 41 has worked well for you on HP? There are several good hubs on numerology in the HP Library... you will find them interesting.Nope..... I'm Not a 9.wordscribe4117 months ago Oh, so 22, right. 2+2=4.  Another weird thing, your nice congratulatory email arrived at 3:23 AM here, after I sent mine off I happened to notice I sent it at EXACTLY 3:23 PM.  Okay, so off to figure out about "4", RIGHT???  BTW, 41 is my age right now.  Thus, the 41.Pearldiver17 months ago I Know 41 is your current age (which is why I put WS42 above; as a reference to your upcoming BD). 3:23 huh? I have spent the last year with everything happening at 10:22 or 22:22!! True. It must be all about Great Minds.... lol.XTASIS17 months ago Very interesting and true !  to focus is the clue. thank you !Pearldiver17 months ago Hi Xtasis, thanks for reading and commenting on my works. Obviously, we mentally program ourselves and use our most prevailent thoughts to focus on what we are trying to achieve. I believe Visualisation helps focus accurately and focusing accurately contributes to achievement. Good Luck.rebekahELLE15 months ago very nice, I'm currently reading the book, Blink, which focuses on this power that we have, it's nice to see your article. thanks!Pearldiver15 months ago Hi rebekahELLE, that's an interesting book that I have considered reading. Be very happy to hear your reveiw of it. Thanks for reading my work and your kind comments. Take care.rebekahELLE15 months ago I'm not too far into the book to give an adequate review, but so far it's fascinating!Pearldiver15 months ago Hi rebekahELLE, Let me know when you've finished it. I guess my intuition should have let me know first, huh? lolgonzo6200315 months ago Interesting...veeerrrrryyyy interesting!!"Have a grr8 day!"Pearldiver15 months ago Hi Gonzo, Thanks for reading this and I hope you carried on to also read the next two works on the subject. If so, then you will gain a better understanding of this article. Life is interesting and cheers; I always have great days. Same to you. Take care.\Brenda Scully15 months ago it is nice to feel safePearldiver15 months ago Hi Brenda, Yes it is nice to feel safe; especially when your chute pops while basejumping! Thanks for reading this and your comment. Take care my friend.Aliswell12 months ago Hello...Should I refer you as Pearl or Diver, or All the above?? I connected with you while reading MickeyDee and found your post to him a Splash of Goodness. Now that I am reading your posts, I will be trying to absorb as much as possible for this Simple Country Boy's Brancells' capacity. My wife (an Indonesian whose Paternal and Maternal Grandmother's both possessed above average MOJO) picked all six numbers for two Powerball jackpots shortly after we moved to Arizona from Indonesia. One was..I believe this was the case, but maybe not completely accurate..a jackpot of $35 Mil and the other was $27 Mil. The Killer is, and was, WE DID NOT BUY THE TICKETS!!!!!! The first excuse...Pure Damn Laziness..just o walk about 2 blocks to a Circle K from our house. The second..We had a little spat, and we were both too stubborn to go buy them. Since we have lived here in Iowa since 2004, she has picked one time 5 numbers, but guess what that only paid $5,0000. Her Grandmother would come to her in a dream and the next day my wife would use a ceremonial type procedure to pick the numbers. Well, I guess Grandma has given up on my wife getting it right, because she has failed to show up for over 4 years.Anyway, enough of my rambling..I am just saying, things are not as they seem from time to time.Pearldiver12 months ago Hi Aliswell, Thankyou fo reading this work. You are quite right in saying that things are not always as they seem. You must run with the gut feelings always, even though it seems practical to 2nd guess those feelings. Often your subconscious mind tries to guide you and I'm sure as with lotteries, it will not be there every day.More often I find that when I least expect it my intuition kicks in. Once agan cheers for your comments. Take care and have a good Christmas.DynamicS11 months ago Pearldiver this post is very deep.  As a youngster I relied on my intuition, but as I got older and more educated, I drifted from it; now I'm seeking to be reconnected with my intuition.  Many times we talk ourselves out of that gut feeling and try to use logic or deduction to solve some challenges, only to create more.  If we surrender ourselves to intuition, we would reach our bless more readily.Thanks for the reminder.  I am a fan!Pearldiver11 months ago Hi Dynamics, thanks for reading this work.  I hope that you carried on to read Parts 2 & 3 in this series.  You are quite right in your comments, we do tend to follow our intuition at our earlier ages, don't we?  It seems that as we get older we tend to second guess our gut feelings, even though we actually know not to.  Take Care, I look forward to reading your works.rebekahELLE4 months ago I'm glad I found this. I was playing around in a 'bad vibe' forum and made my way to this thread through another poster. I love reading your hubs because they're so full of depth and insight. I think intuition is a powerful natural tool we've been given to help us navigate our way though this journey. It takes a strong sense of self to follow it and trust that we are equipped with all that we need, or more aptly expressed, we are equipped with all that we need to obtain what we need or know. I'll be sure to continue reading your series. I hope you're doing well. xoPearldiver4 months ago Hi Rebekah, thanks for your comments and for taking the time to read this work again. You do realise that you had read this before yeah?  I recall that you were reading Blink and now you have reminded me that I still haven't read it and must.You are right; Intuition certainly is a powerful natural tool; but it is one that many of us really don't utilize; perhaps choosing to replace its immediate presence with that of hindsight huh? Take care and thanks for your best wishes.2uesday8 weeks ago I think for me it is sometimes difficult to act on intuition if it involves others; because they tend to deal in facts. I am trying to describe - when you know something is not right and needs sorting out, but you cannot pin down enough facts to get others to listen. Probably sounding a bit odd, as I do not have the right words but intuition or instinct may be the best description of it.This was an interesting read.Pearldiver8 weeks ago Hi 2uesday (love your name), no, no you don't sound a bit odd at all. Intuition is a personal occurrence and it is (I'm sure) drawn from your subconscious mind. I have found that mine works best when I am focused (as Xtasis said above) and at peace in a positive frame of mind. So others tend to act as distractions... most times it is best Not to bother trying to explain as they will never experience the same thought process. Thanks for reading and for your comment... take care.lea867 weeks ago I agree that when we 'Believe and Trust' along our way of life will actually make us feel safe; and I think people who knew how to practice positive attitude are not negative people, on my opinion, they want to improve their weaknesses to the people they love, to their job and to get a better life.Pearldiver7 weeks ago Hi lea86, thanks for reading this work... I hope you carried on and read the second and third installments. Yes you are right.. positive energy creates positive energy and most enjoy the company of positive people over the negative ones! It does start with the individual and grows from there. Cheers for your comment. Take Care.Ashantina2 weeks ago It feels like there are three 'selves' which influence our decisions: heart, head, and gut feeling [intuition]. I have learned the hard way to go with the latter. Always.Great article :)Pearldiver2 weeks ago Hi Ashantina, thanks for reading this work and for your intuitive comment.  I do believe that you really can not separate the 'whole' of yourself in a general sense. If you are analyzing yourself of course you must consider each aspect, however, in normal time, if events occur and you must deal with them immediately, you do not always have that privilege to be able to choose which 'self' you will use! It is then that your true intuitiveness comes into play... what self is the best for the event? If urgent, it will always be the self that is most capable for the situation. If you can live on that basis, then I guess you have arrived at a far higher plateau than most. Good Luck on your journey.
