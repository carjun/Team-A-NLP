At the Consumer Electronics Show, conference goers weighed in on the news.(WSJ)The move will for the first time let U.S. consumers choose the network that carries their iPhone and perhaps give them additional pricing options that could affect their monthly bills.It wasnt immediately clear when Verizon would have the device in stores.It will also upend the balance of power in the industry, ending Verizon rivalAT&T Inc.s exclusive hold on the device and leaving smaller players likeSprint Nextel Corp. and T-Mobile USA facing two well-capitalized competitors offering the worlds most popular smartphone.The Verizon phone will be similar to the iPhone 4 but run on the carriers CDMA technology, people familiar with the matter have said.Verizon Wireless is a joint venture betweenVerizon Communications Inc. andVodafone Group Plc.Apple is moving to expand its carrier base in the U.S. at a time when it is facing increasing pressure from phones powered by rivalGoogle Inc.s operating system, called Android.Google gives its software away, hoping to stake out space on mobile phones where it can sell ads and other services.Android-based phones passed the iPhone in sales in the second quarter, according to research firm GartnerRead more:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704739504576068170230339348.html#ixzz1ASctZdac*http://getclicky.com/marketshare/us/droid/Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Entertainment, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAndroid phone system vs iPhone, Apple Computer, AT&T, Verizon iPhone salesRead moreThe 15 Most Hated Companies in America..January 8, 2011jamesb101No commentsFrom The Atlantic magazine.Some of the results shouldnt surprise you. Many of the companies on this list are partially doomed by their industry. Airlines, cable companies, and banks for example, are often maligned by their customers. Retail firms and companies that were sensitive to downturns in the economy had to lay off significant numbers of employees during the recession, which bred resentment.But several companies you might have expected on this list arent. AIG became a pariah after its federal bailout, but it does not show up on the list thanks to high earnings over the past year, as its stock has nearly doubled. Goldman Sachs, that infamous vampire squid of Wall Street, earned a fair share of negative press and popular resentment since the credit crunch. But Goldman also ranked near the top in categories like customer satisfaction, shareholder satisfaction, employee satisfaction and CEO approval. GM has faced similar obstacles, but its also seen a spate of good news in the last few months, with profits, hires, and a successful IPO winning it more positive press coverage.More..Why am I not surprised that Bank of America tops the list?Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Other Things, The Economy, UpdatesAT&T, Bank of America, BP, Citibank, Dell, Direct TV, McDonalds, Nokia, The 15 Most Hated Companies in America, ToyotaRead moreNate Silver goes after Stu Rothenberg for a bad call.January 7, 2011jamesb1012 commentsNate is calling out Rothenberg on a call he made on April 23rd , 2009..On that date Rothenberg announced that the GOP could NOT win a majority of House seats in 2010Of course he was wrong..Silver of Fivethirtyeigth goes on to say that when Rothenberg actually started reading the polls etc. in 2010..He correctly came up with the closet GOP House gains..ButSilver wants Rothenberg to own up to the mistaken April 23rd call.Maybe he will.And maybe he wont..How Not To Take Responsibility For a Failed ForecastByNATE SILVERTheHouse race forecasts issued by Stu Rothenberg and his team on the eve of last Novembers elections performed extremely well.Not only did the Rothenberg Political Report project the overall number of Republican gains correctly  [a] likely Republican gain of 55-65 [House] seats, with gains at or above 70 seats possible, they wrote (the Republicans actually gained 63 seats in the House), but the Rothenberg team also did quite well in projecting the outcome of individual races.If you assess them one point for every missed won-loss prediction and half a point for each race in which they declined to designate a favorite and called the race a toss-up, then Mr. Rothenbergs team scored just 18 points on the night (fewer points is better), compared with 18 for Larry Sabatos forecasts; 19 for FiveThirtyEight; 29 for RealClearPolitics; 29.5 for CQ Politics; 31 for the Cook Political Report, and 33 for HuffPost Pollster (HuffPost Pollster did not issue forecasts in a few competitive races, so I assigned them the Cook Political forecast in these cases).The night after the election, once Id seen how well Rothenbergs team had done, I sent a note to Nathan Gonzales, the political editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, complimenting the team on their performance. Their forecasts have been quite reliable in the past as well, which is why we incorporate them  along with forecasts from Cook Political, CQ Politics and Mr. Sabato  into our own House race projections.Much earlier in the political cycle, however, Mr. Rothenberg had made a very silly forecast.Read moreNote .Stu Rothenberg is already out with a caution that Democrats have a better chance of retaking the House back than keep the Senate come the 2012 Elections.Share on Facebook  Tweet This Post Blogs, Breaking News, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, Polls, UpdatesApril 23rd /2009 Rothenberg call, Macro vs Micro forcasts, Nate Silver @FiveThirtyEight @ the NY Times, Polling giants, Predictions vs Forcasts, Stu Rothenberg political reportRead moreHow about a woman replacement for Robert Gibbs as White House Press Secretary?January 7, 2011jamesb101No commentsIf Im correct the last woman to hold the office was Dee Dee Myers in the Clinton Administration.Are there any good ones from Chicage available?Politics Daily has a list of a few good women to choose fromThe White House is looking for a successor to departing press secretary Robert Gibbs, and the top prospects  as usual  are men. But PoliticosMike Allen says new chief of staff Bill Daley would like a woman in the job.A woman as the face of this administration  why, that would be something new and different.The most important qualities in a press secretary include access to the president, clarity of expression, ease on camera, and good relations with reporters. The names in the mix so far are deputy press secretaries Bill Burton (whod be the first black press secretary) and Josh Earnest, and vice presidential communications director Jay Carney.Its unclear how much influence Daley will have over the choice. MSNBC says hell have input, but incoming senior adviserDavid Plouffe will lead the search and have the biggest say. Its also unclear who if any of Washingtons major female players would take the job. Some of them have spouses and-or children; at least one already knows exactly how consuming the job would be because shes already done it.Still, Plouffe et al should take this seriously. There would be no better way to dilute the Club Men impression the Obama White House gives off. Here are some possibilities, some more famous than others and some more feasible (those who are declared Democrats, for a start):Gwen Ifill. Former New York Times reporter, current moderator and managing editor of PBS Washington Week in Review and senior correspondent on The PBS NewsHour, and author of The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama. Shes poised, well informed, funny and friendly on the air.

think if Obama is smart enough to listen to him he will be a good moderating influence (keep in mind this is coming from a Right of Center perspective) on a President who shunned Rahm for the expert opinions of Valarie Jarret (exactly what the f#*k does she know about anything again?) and political guru Axlrod, who had no more business making policy than Karl Rove.If he just sits back and listens

off the clock while his state was buried in 3 feet of snow?Is the Governors family and need for a vacation more important than him making his way back home to help the state dig out of the snow messA few things to think over..Could the Governor have returned to New Jersey any earlier than WednesdayTwo days after it snowed?Newark Airport was closed..Could the Governor have set up a command post in Florida and worked the situation from there?Was the Governor under the protection of the New Jersey State Police.Therefore technically assumed to be working leader of the state?That is even though he

Its Daley and David Plouffe  and then everyone else. Indeed, it will be much more top-down than the previous regime. By the way, its Plouffe  and not Daley  who will lead the search for a new White House press secretary; Daley will have input, but the communications aspect of the White House falls under Plouffe and hell have the biggest say.Meanwhile, Toby Harnden reports press secretary Robert Gibbs wanted to be a presidential counselor  something hes been putting about for quite a while  but William Daley, the new chief of staff, nixed this because he believed that too many cooks would spoil the presidential broth.

He seeks to borrow through bonds $4.4 Billion in funding..Second .He seeks to get up to $600 million from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.The reception to his announcement has been cool to cold.The democrats are not happyabout the amount of money the Governor wants to borrow.(Remember the Feds still want about $127 million back on the money given to the state for the tunnel).Going to the Port Authority, a bi-state agency that is jointly beholding to the New York and New Jersey Governors is gonna take some horse trading with New York Governor Cuomo.(Christie would also take some money from the New Jersey Turnpike Authority)The Authority had made a commitment to help funding the tunnel..So Christie feels hes on safe ground to ask for the money from themHe will have to see how the bond market greet his idea of borrowing which doesnt make him look too good.With the tunnel he would have got a good deal of money as grants from the Feds.Now with this plan. He puts the NY-NJ region drivers using the Port Authoritys Tunnels and Bridges and NJ Turnpike on the hook, along with the New Jersey taxpayers for 30 yearsNone of his plans change the statement he made about the tunnelThe state doesnt have the money ..The Republican Governor seems to be following his friends in Congress.Spend now.Pay later..Mr. Christies plan came more than two months after he had scrapped a commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River, saying that New Jersey could not afford it with its main fund for highway repairs about to run dry. The Port Authority and the federal government had each committed to provide $3 billion toward the tunnel.The tunnels supporters had argued that it would alleviate congestion for New Jersey residents who travel daily across the river to work and would stimulate growth of the regional economy. Now, Mr. Christie is instead asking the Port Authority to spend $1.8 billion to build and repair infrastructure that does not span the border between the states, including the Pulaski Skyway, which connects Newark to Jersey City.The tunnel didnt happen, and the money is there to be utilized, Mr. Christie said. It should be utilized for transportation projects to improve this state.Mr. Christie, a Republican, said his plan was more fiscally responsible than those of his predecessors because it would rely less on borrowing, and more of the $1.6 billion in annual spending would come from cash on hand. The principal and interest on the $4.4 billion in borrowing would be paid off in level payments over 30 years, he said.So no big balloon at the end, Mr. Christie said. No big payments that someones going to have to swallow 30 years from now.The plan would divert some money collected as tolls by theNew Jersey Turnpike Authority into the fund for transportation improvements. Over the five years, the amount of annual spending not derived from borrowing would rise from $75 million in 2012 to more than $600 million in 2016, Mr. Christie said.The governor said that $672 million a year would go towardNew Jersey Transit, which operates the states trains and buses, and an additional $200 million would be spent annually on local projects.Democratic elected officials and some mass transit advocates criticized the plan as being vague and as lacking any suggestion of an alternative to the tunnel as an aid to commuters who cross the Hudson River every dayMoreSome more details on the story. Under the governors plan, the state will pull money from various sources  including Port Authority and Turnpike Authority dollars that were supposed to go to a Hudson River tunnel project that Christie scrapped in October  to pay for projects between fiscal years 2012 and 2016.Altogether, the Transportation Trust Fund plan blends about $4.4 billion in borrowed money with the Turnpike Authority and Port Authority money and money from the general fund to pay for $8 billion in transportation spending over five years, Christie said at a Trenton press conference.He said it is more fiscally sound than the previous 5-year-plan because it uses less borrowing.The previous plan, which expires June 30, was a plan that relied almost exclusively on borrowing and on the most irresponsible borrowing you could possibly do. Christie said. That plan relied on 30-year notes with no principal or interest due until year 30, he said.Fast factsGovernor Christies transportation plan also calls on the Port Authority  a bi-state agency  to pay for the following projects in the Port District:The Pulaski SkywayWittpenn Bridge on Route 7 in KearnyRoute 139 which links the Holland tunnel to Routes 1&9 and Route 78Portway New Road: A new road to connect St. Pauls Avenue along the CSX rail road crossing over New County Road and terminating at Secaucus Road in Jersey City.Critics, however, slammed the governor for borrowing money, and for directing money from the scuttled tunnel project, known as Access to the Regions Core, or ARC, to keep highway, bridge and transit projects afloat.MoreShare on Facebook  Tweet This Post Breaking News, Government, Media, Men, Other Things, Politics, The Economy, UpdatesBorrowing for transportation projects, Getting money from the Port Authority of NY&NJ, National Transportation Trust Fund, NJ Governor Chris Christie, NJ Turnpike Authority, NY Governor Cuomo, Port Authority of NY&NJ, Talkandpolitics @ Politicaldog101Read morePage 2 of 112Previous Page1234...112Next PageYour Ad HereArchives by the Month  Select Month  January 2011 (145) December 2010 (497) November 2010 (511) October 2010 (559) September 2010 (629) August 2010 (608) July 2010 (614) June 2010 (242) May 2010 (1) February 2010 (318) January 2010 (592) December 2009 (413) November 2009 (257) October 2009 (189) September 2009 (107) August 2009 (60) July 2009 (12) For Posts from July 28, 2009 thru June 17, 2010 on our original blog go tojamesb101.wordpress.com                               ***The Dog is VERY happy to have Talkandpolitics and theOligarch Kings as brother blogger sites!                              ***We are also happy to feature Scott Elliot's Election*ProjectionBlogrollConservative State ProjectJezebelPOLITICS 2Riders On the StormTalkandpoliticsThe Oligarch KingsNew York StateCapital ConfidentialPolitickerNYRoom 8/ New York PloiticsPolitcsElection ProjectionElectoral-Vote.ComPolitcs1 2010 CalenderPolitcs1 States RacesPolitcs1.ComPoliticalwirePolitico Election 2010Politics DailyReal Clear PoliticsThe Atlantic MagazineThe HillPollingFiveThirtyEightPoliticalwirePolling ReportPollster.ComRasmussen ReportsYour Ad HereMeta Register Log inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgtwitter The Dog is Nowback  on twitter @ jamesb@politicaldog101.com Twitter  Reuters Top US NewsDoctors optimistic about shot congresswoman Giffords January 9, 2011Nation's first veterans court counts its successes January 9, 2011Policeman, civilian killed in Baltimore shooting January 9, 2011Severe winter storms forecast for Southern states January 9, 2011Portuguese journalist killed in New York hotel January 9, 2011Buffalo man accused of beheading wife goes to trial January 9, 2011Buried explosives, weapons recovered in Tacoma suburb January 9, 2011Recent Commentsjamesb101 on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..Scott P on Will the Democrats be able to gain control of Congress again by 2016?Scott P on Conservatives Take Issue With Links to Tucson Shooting Rhetoric..jamesb101 on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSDDemocratic Socialist Dave on The Questions of the Civil War, Slavery and Why Lincoln faught the South.DSD Your Ad Here 2011 Politicaldog101.ComDesign by SRS Solutions
