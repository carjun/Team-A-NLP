I'm presuming the answer is that it just can't do it, and it's not on the horizon - but it's worth asking anywhooo, I guess. It also leads me to my more cheeky question - which is to see if you would be at all interested in creating notthe.wikipediaweekly.org at all, and maybe hosting an mp3 file or two? - my small efforts in encouraging community chit chat are intended to be complementary to your own esteemed 'round tables' and interviews - and I've had a few emails from people asking about an RSS feed - which I think is a good idea in principle, but lack the clue to implement / deliver.....give some thought, and let me know if something like kicking in for the hosting costs might be appropriate, or if you've got any questions at all.... cheers - Privatemusings (talk) 02:30, 14 March 2008 (UTC)[edit] my RFAThank you!Thank you for your support in my RFA.

Preceding unsigned comment added by Nra4ever5585 (talk  contribs) 20:01, 25 March 2008 (UTC)[edit] Jimmy Wales protectionWhy is there any level of protection on the article Jimmy Wales, yet there are few other biographies of living persons on Wikipedia that are so protected? Is it because you and Jimmy don't trust the "wiki way" to produce responsible, accountible reference pages related to living people, but you extend the courtesy of "protection" to those who are on the "inside"? It just doesn't seem fair. Like a Chevy salesman who won't let his family drive anything but BMW's.

I think there was something like that when I was reading how to do references a while ago, but I guess, the same resource is used twice and the second time the cite note click doesn't work because it brings it to:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_C-61#endnote_http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/06/12/tech-copyright.htmlinstead of:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_C-61#cite_note-0and replacing the brackets with the greater than and less than method of ref just creates duplicates in notes(well, as far as I know on my browser), just something trivial Noian (talk) 21:22, 13 June 2008 (UTC)[edit] Broken Ref on Bill pagedo you know what caused it?Noian (talk) 18:44, 18 June 2008 (UTC)Do what was done with the $20,000, say that "since bill 61-c doesn't apply to all" (or maybe we can combine both together), the following will happen based on previous legislation:listlistlistin addition, other legislation (like ACTA) have been proposed to make the following changes:listlistlistSee main article actaor something like that (really roughh outline) Noian (talk) 18:48, 18 June 2008 (UTC)[edit] Speedy deletion of "PUMA Pac"A page you created, PUMA Pac, has been tagged for deletion, as it meets one or more of the criteria for speedy deletion; specifically, it is about a real person, group of people, band, club, company, organisation, or web content, but does not indicate why its subject is important or significant.You are welcome to contribute content which complies with our content policies and any applicable inclusion guidelines.

Lampman (talk) 01:37, 12 August 2008 (UTC)[edit] CFS IntroDear Tawker, I'm going to revert your last edit to CFS regarding the mandate issue. I'm also reminding you that I would like you to remove the paragraph you added as you know it is not sourced and not relevant. Nocandu1976 (talk) 19:39, 12 August 2008 (UTC)The first has been reviewed by another party and edited to that extent. The second paragraph is entirely relevant given the legal papers served surrounding using "CFS" to describe a provincial chapter which brands itself as "CFS." The section has been directly cited and additional cites available via simple web searches. I'm not removing it. -- Tawker (talk) 20:33, 12 August 2008 (UTC)Tawker: With the first sentence, your second edit to that is fine, although I saw no reason to tinker with the sentence in the first place. my mistake I just got mixed up between that and your first edit which wasn't so neutral sounding.With the second paragraph, it's relevancy is in question, it is not notable, and it is an non-constructive edit. Howcome you didn't bring this up in the discussion page like you are supposed to. You are on wikipedia long enough you should know this.Also, you added another unqualified edit to the 2008 referendums section. We talked about this didn't we? You and I, I don't understand why you'd go ahead and insert "independent elections administrator." We were talking about this for days but then you try to sneak it in the backdoor. Be upfront and reasonable, let's talk this shit out or the page is going to continue to be crappy, marred by bad grammar, spelling mistakes, and non-neutral language.Nocandu1976 (talk) 21:01, 12 August 2008 (UTC)[edit] C+ rating?!What is that?
