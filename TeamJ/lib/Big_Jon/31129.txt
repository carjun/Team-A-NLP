Gabriel Giffords and the rightwing hate machine (on the bogus equivalency between right/left extremism)January 9, 2011 by Peter Daou Reaction to the horrific Arizona shootings, where six people were slaughtered including a 9-year-old girl, quickly congealed along clear-cut lines:a) The left blamed the right, pointing to violent imagery and language from Sarah Palin to the Tea Party.b) The right furiously denied blame, with some trying to pin the shooting on the left.c) Among public officials, pundits and press, the common impulse was to draw the typical false equivalency between rhetoric on the right and left.At least one person was not buying that false equivalency:When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol that comes out of certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous. And, unfortunately, Arizona I think has become sort of the capital. We have become the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry.  Pima County Sheriff Clarence DupnikWe do not yet know whether the Arizona massacre was directly fueled by rightwing rhetoric. But we do know this: one of the most dangerous myths promulgated by the media and political establishment is that there is a comparable level of extremism among conservatives and liberals, that left and right are mirror images.Even the most cursory perusal of rightwing radio, television, blogs and assorted punditry illustrates a profound distinction: in large measure, the rights overarching purpose is to stoke hatred of the left, of liberalism. The rights messaging infrastructure, meticulously constructed and refined over decades, promotes an image of liberals as traitors and America-haters, unworthy of their country and bent on destroying it. There is simply no comparable propaganda effort on the left.The imbalance is stark: Democrats and liberals rail against the rights ideas; the right rails against the lefts very existence.The result is an atmosphere where bigotry thrives, where science and reason are under assault, where progress (associated with progressivism) is frowned upon. And its an atmosphere where violence becomes more likely. Pretending this is not the case is to enable it.The deeply-etched themes that run through American politics reflect the rights successful framing: Democrats and liberals are wimps, Republicans and conservatives are gun-toting patriots; Democrats and liberals despise their country, Republicans and conservatives are the only ones willing to protect it; Democrats and liberals want to intrude on your freedom, tax you and bankrupt the nation, Republicans and conservatives want to give you freedom, liberty and wealth. The current of eliminationism infusing the rights worldview is an inevitable outcome of such contorted impressions  its a natural impulse to want to destroy that which is (supposedly) destroying you.MORERefresh|+70 RecommendationsPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Top      Replies to this threadRec #5...

There is a blatant pattern of media analysis/trope/meme misrepresenting the level of violent rhetoric and actions in this country. It is very real, whether conscious on the part of the participants or not. Recognizing this is not "group narcissism."Here's discussion of NON-equivalence in our current political context:http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker/2011... ...and maybe the gunman had no idea why he was aiming for Giffords either, maybe he didn't know how she voted on health care or what her position on Arizonas draconian immigration law was. It would be a kind of relief if Loughner operated not out of any coherent political context but just his own fevered brain.But even so, the tragedy wouldn't change this basic fact: for the past two years, many conservative leaders, activists, and media figures have made a habit of trying to delegitimize their political opponents. Not just arguing against their opponents, but doing everything possible to turn them into enemies of the country and cast them out beyond the pale. Instead of soft on defense, one routinely hears the words treason and traitor. The President isn't a big-government liberalhe's a socialist who wants to impose tyranny. He's also, according to a minority of Republicans, including elected officials, an impostor. Even the reading of the Constitution on the first day of the 112th Congress was conceived as an assault on the legitimacy of the Democratic Administration and Congress.This relentlessly hostile rhetoric has become standard issue on the right. (On the left it appears in anonymous comment threads, not congressional speeches and national T.V. programs.) And it has gone almost entirely uncriticized by Republican leaders. Partisan media encourages it, while the mainstream media finds it titillating and airs it, often without comment, so that the gradual effect is to desensitize even people to whom the rhetoric is repellent.

There was no Limbaugh, no Beck, no Fox Freaking News and its CNN wannabe, no continuous barrage of violent hateful rhetoric describing the mainstream other political party and its adherents as unamerican with frequent insinuations of the violence that ought to befall these outsiders - us here on this board for example, and Congresswoman Giffords explicitly. All directed and coordinated by the leadership of one of the mainstream political parties and pouring out of major media outlets. Walter Cronkite was not on the air supporting Huey Newton. All of which is irrelevant anyway, as it was 40 freaking years ago. Right here and right now there is no equivalence.

The lack of backbone in the dems leads to an ever smaller voice, an ever more right shift to appease the bullies on the right. This will never work and can only lead to yet more intimidation and ultimately to fascism.The right makes up nonsense to destroy the dems. The left attempts to bring FACTS into discussion. The right then projects their own behavior onto the dems, and the media buys it and the dems refuse to fight.

The right wing  take over of our national discourse has been quite deliberate.I hope we will see see Americans for Prosperity and other professional right wing PR firms sharing the blame for the latest right wing terrorism. Right wing PR firms that "helped" their constituents with their violent messaging should be rebuked along with Palin. Dick Armey should be called out too. And Charles Grassley was only criticized on token liberal news shows when he showed up at Tea Party rallies to stoke the fears about Death Panels. Professional right wing PR firms took public desperation after the Bush Economic Crash and turned it against the government as a whole. Getting desperate people to scream against the very things that could have reduced some of their anguish-- government assistance with more medical expenses, and government jobs repairing our crumbling infrastructure and greening it so our country could catch up with the international green technology markets. Why do the false equivalency people have to reach way back to the 60's to find their violent people "from the left"? Because those groups were crushed through concerted government action. Furthermore, the private sector in the USA took advantage of the fear of left wing fringe violence in those times to crush public support for social and economic justice. Those who wanted to absorb the maximum amount of profit from their corporations, rather than sharing more with the workers who contributed to their success (as is done in Europe with government funded health care, longer vacations, and better social benefits overall), established more long term campaigns against balanced government, in which billions have been invested over the past 30 years.  http://www.reclaimdemocracy.org/corporate_accountabilit... The shift to the Right in our national media has not been a gradual response to naturally evolving public opinion, it has been a concerted campaign conducted on many different levels. Eric Alterman's book has many of those details well documented. www.whatliberalmedia.com   And let's not forget the millions spent targeting our last Democratic president. http://www.thehuntingofthepresident.com /The professional right wing PR organizations have been wildly successful in maximizing corporate profits over here. But at what cost? http://www.alternet.org/story/149324/america_in_decline... In Germany, where they actually had the scary red army factions, they realized that making sure their workers retained more benefits and stronger unions would do more to quell the desperate craziness that drove the radicalism in the first place. I was hoping my Democrats would do that here. I hoped we would go all FDR at the beginning of President Obama's term, even with Medicare for All, using the millions of evictions (aka foreclosures) and the Bush Crash as the driving motivation. By now, millions could be feeling the amazing comfort of national health security, and the pride of being engaged in repairing our national infrastructure and boosting our country's ability to compete in green technologies, instead of the desperation of continued foreclosures and some health reforms but looming mandates and continued unemployment while the ravages of climate change strain even more of our crumbling infrastructure.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Toptruth2power      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 12:22 PMResponse to Original message41.Thank you, Hissyspit, for another excellent post. ...I see they're out in force, already.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topscarletwoman      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 03:40 PMResponse to Original message45.Kick for one of the best OPs on this matter.
