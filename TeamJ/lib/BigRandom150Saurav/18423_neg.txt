From armed militias on the border, to senatorial candidates touting "Second Amendment remedies," the American Southwest has been a laboratory used by mainstream Republicans to exploit the narrative of extremist groups, using the banner of "immigration reform" to put lipstick on their mendacious piggies seeking office. Now, with the assassination of a Federal Judge and the near assassination of beloved congresswoman, it is our responsibility to look this aggression straight in the eye, not make excuses for these terrorists, and get about the business of ridding our political discourse of the narrative of "don't retreat, reload." I am deeply concerned that people seem anxious to put aside the political realities of this narrative of aggression that has produced this horrific tragedy. I believe that this is something that all people of good faith could agree on: we are a nation that resolves conflict without loading a gun in the first place -- much less "reloading."  The argument that the shooter was potentially insane holds no water for me. Is every suicide bomber mentally competent? Or, are the weakest used by the powerful to carry their bombs, their guns and their "messages"? Sarah Palin likes to pose with guns, and the Republican National Committee uses gun possession as a litmus test for fitness of office. Do not think for a minute that these elites intend to open fire on congressional democrats -- they are cowards, encouraging the weakest of their flock to do their dirty work, because this gives meaning to their campaign slogans in the real world. The unfolding discussion around this tragedy has opened my eyes to the horrific reality that there are those who would give cover to domestic terrorists. They're using the First Amendment as their golden shield. That we can't regulate speech is a burning straw man because no one intends to regulate speech, we intend to hold those using the threat of domestic terrorism accountable for the deaths they're responsible for. The so-called "mainstream" American right wing has been using the threat of domestic terrorism for decades. They've been couching their discourse in the life-or-death struggle with "death panels," and that the president is a Muslim infiltrator, and that immigration is destroying the country. You can't scratch these rage nuts for years on end, without getting a violent rash. For years, mainstream Republicans have been chipping away at the seal holding back an insurrection of violence in this country. Now the seal has been broken, and the American Right Wing, the Tea Party, and all their minions in the media with blood on their hands have nowhere to hide. They were so eager to "water the tree of liberty" with the blood of innocents and the soul of our nation. Well, congratulations -- you've got what you asked for.  There is no mental exam that can excuse political assassination and the shooting of 19 people at a political event. It was a planned massacre, aimed directly at a political leader of a specific stripe, carried out by people with a philosophy of hate. Because the threat of domestic terrorism is real, as we saw yesterday, there is no longer any excuse...no longer any political cover...for political leaders exploiting the fears of the weakest in their flock for their short term political gain. No more targets on congressional districts. No more guns touted at political rallies. The protest signs weren't funny then, and they can no longer be excused as oblique. The threat to our country, and specifically to our party is very real. If you don't think this is serious, you're not paying attention.

How could this happen? We never meant them to be "gunsights." You can't take us seriously when say the government is your deadly enemy and doctors are murderers. You can't expect us to change what we're saying because a CRAZY PERSON took us seriously and responded as though we spoke the truth.So they continue. As long as as hysterical threats and calls to arms and the demonization of people with whom they disagree works, rightwingers and the Republican Party in general will keep doing it. No one's pushed back yet, so why stop?And get ready for the  desperate flailing to defend the entitlement of rightwingers to defend their tactics. This was a "lone nut." The "left" does "the same thing." A few liberals getting shot here and there is the price we have to pay for "free speech." It's not terrorism when rightwingers do it. Etc. It will get as loud and as long as it needs to be to make sure Michele Bachmann can still hint that the Census might be a plot to round people up into internment camps, and Steve King can still shrug when someone murders an IRS employee. But at what point do we stop accepting that narrative? Not after abortion clinics were bombed. Not after Dr. Tiller and other abortion providers were assassinated. Not after the attack on the Holocaust Museum. Not after the killings at the Unitarian Church. Not after the woman looking for Beck's "FEMA deathcamps" was stopped with a wagon full of rifles. Not after the convict loaded up to attack the ACLU and the Tides Foundation shot it out with police. Not when Rand Paul's goons kicked a prostrate woman in the skull, making her brain bleed.Not now?So, when? When will stop accepting the narrative that the rightwing can consistently ratchet up its rhetoric with dark hints of gunfire and blood in the streets, exhorting their faithful to "buy all the ammo you can" and "be ready," and then shrug when someone actually takes them at their word and tries to "start the revolution?"  Nashville's right. It's never the demagogues who pick up a weapon. They have their listeners, viewers, and adherents to do that. The mentally unstable kid or disaffected worker or angry ex-husband, ex-con, ex-employee, looking for a target for their frustration, and the rightwing is there. Fox News is there. The "Tea Party" is there. Telling them to arm themselves against the coming apocalypse of progressive taxation or socialized medicine or gays in the military. Telling them, as the bumper sticker goes, that the liberals are coming for their "money, guns and freedom."They talk in these terms freely, and at the highest level, knowing it's bullshit and, when pressed hard, admitting it and pleading hyperbole or ignorance.  Then they squint and shed crocodile tears when people do things that, if the things the rightwing routinely insists were true, would be the expected response from anyone. If healthcare reform was a plot to kill the elderly, as the Respected Senator Grassley blithely suggested, or if the President was a radical Muslim infiltrator without an American birth certificate as the Honorable Congressman Steve King smirkingly alluded from the floor of Congress. If abortion providers were bloodthirsty "baby killers."If this is not what the rightwing wants, why do they speak in these terms? You can't shriek hysterically about your political opponents trying to kill people and destroy America, and then disclaim responsibility when some poor misguided soul makes the mistake of actually believing you. Why do they ask candidates for leadership of the Republican Party "how many guns you own?" What is it, exactly, they are promoting by painting any initiative they and their corporate sponsors oppose in terms of treason and the destruction of America and "the blood of tyrants?"If they don't want violence, they shouldn't say things which, if taken at all seriously, would REQUIRE IT.Most of them think they're being cute. They're entitled to act out this way, because conservatives are entitled to the benefit of the doubt. Witness the smirk on the "We came unarmed (this time)" gent in the last picture of NB's post. They're entitled strap on weapons and hint darkly at apocalypse. Or to hold unemployment benefits or the national debt ceiling "hostage" to get ... what? Tax breaks for billionaires? Another trillion in war funding? A cut to Social Security benefits? Look at how much they threaten, how blithely, for how little. There IS NO parity to this violence and the hysterical rhetoric that feeds it on the "leftwing" as we will soon hear suggested, either. Imagine the outcry if a liberal or, say, immigrant group, had brought guns to a political speech, or kicked a woman unconscious in the street? ACORN was dismantled overnight based on a college kid's dishonest prank video, but the Tea Party's beating a woman senseless didn't even slow its candidate Rand Paul down.  If these were rightwingers dead in the street, we'd be having an entirely different conversation. THAT would be labeled "terrorism," without a moment's debate.The rightwinger's version of the "Tree of Liberty" is drowning,  in the blood they've been screaming for since they lost the 2008 election and before. Blood they will tell us is only coincidentally only that of people they disagree with politically. The question is, are we, as a country, going let it go, again?

They're going to hold the debt ceiling hostage, threatening to bankrupt the country which will cause a global financial collapse. They can't compete on the field of idea without their version of terror. It's time to call an end.

Don't count on any of those who fan the flames of violence to care what you say.i wish I could say otherwise.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnashville_brook      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 08:37 PMResponse to Reply #4852.so, you wish i'd just go away. and anyone else who refuses to let them get away with it.Edited on Sun Jan-09-11 09:01 PM by nashville_brookis it better to say nothing...keep my powder dry? really, it's such a giant battle and they have all the money and guns and broadcast satellites...what's the point?i'm choosing not to be so cynical about this that i remain silent. it's a lot harder road to travel than sitting back b/c really, "the deck is stacked against us."Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopTsiyu      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 09:28 PMResponse to Reply #5259.Nopei keep kicking your thread because I agree with youI've said that.I'm not going away, not keeping my powder dry, and I've got so many "fuck you's" welling up in my chest right now it's a good thing I don't have the best long distance calling planNot asking that of you either.but be prepared for the complete lack of integrity in those who fan the flames.I guess I was just letting off my own steam, not trying to dissuade yousorry for the misunderstandingPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnashville_brook      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 09:52 PMResponse to Reply #5963.:) sorriessee above, my thoughts on the ethical lens. i don't have many pressure points. my anger problem is that i basically don't have anger. but, i have this sense of justice, and it feels soooo wrong to imagine that there's no meaningful action to be taken in the midst of injustice. you know, two summers ago, during the health care debate...when the tea party was catapulted into the national spotlight thru their town hall hissy fits...i saw this coming. it was especially bad here in florida. tampa in particular. and i thought we're staying away b/c we're afraid. we don't know what to do, and we don't have any who has our back the way the bullies do. and that has to stop. we have to see ourselves as part of this, and our inaction as just much a "conscious effort" as their violent acts. thanks for setting me straight! sorries. big time!Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnadinbrzezinski      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:08 PMResponse to Original message14.This is not a gameand it is time people wake upPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|TopAspenRose      (1000+ posts)Sun Jan-09-11 02:12 PMResponse to Reply #1417.Indeed...they need to wake the hell upPrinter Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnashville_brook      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 03:14 PMResponse to Reply #1433.there are too many cowards hiding behind the "all fair" in political gamesmanshipshield. I really like what you wrote about the mental illness angle. the cowards are also holding the first amendment hostage -- as in, a few dead people is the price we pay for freedom of speech. there's a gasping chasm between criticizing threats of violence for political gain, and regulating speech. this is connecting the dots -- they OWN this baby they've created.

They know what they're doing, tapping into hair-trigger personalities. I live in a right-wing community and have been shocked how people weave in the use of guns to express their level of anger. When someone lost water while they were showering they said of the construction workers outside, "I was ready to get my shot-gun." Another guy laughingly talked about sending a Commissioner a mail bomb. I listened to a young male who said, "I swear, I'll shoot whoever talks badly about so-and-so." He was red faced, so there was no question he was serious.And these are the good people in this community! I also hear, "there's no jury in the land who will convict him," to suggest that there are some crimes you can commit and still get off the hook. These people are living in a different reality than the rest of us. So it is especially frightening to have politicians tapping into this insanity, because the next step was just a matter of time.We cannot allow the right-wing media to get off the hook and make it sound like this is a problem that affects both parties, because it isn't. This is mostly a right-wing affectation which has serious consequences.Printer Friendly|Permalink|Reply|Topnashville_brook      (1000+ posts)      Sun Jan-09-11 02:50 PMResponse to Reply #1629.these RW wackos have a dual ego: they are victims who can't be stopped.they want everyone to believe that their "rights" are being so trampled...by having to pay taxes!...that they "have no other option" but to threaten shotgun justice. the very existence of the union hangs in the balance you see, b/c....SOCIALISM! but what they really mean is "non-white people who scare me" b/c my radio/teevee tells me i must be scared of the people coming to take away my guns and women. well, that's one level of the hell. then there's the cold-eyed Chamber of Commerce types who exploit the ignorance of the people lower on the scale, and on up the food chain to congressional leaders and senatorial candidates calling for "second amendment remedies." these murders will stick to these so-called leaders who have used this violent rhetoric. they own it now.
