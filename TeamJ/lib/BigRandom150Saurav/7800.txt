(AP) - Betty White joked that Facebook seemed like a huge waste of time during her wildly successful hosting gig on "Saturday Night Live." Turns out she wasn't kidding."That was a line that was written for me, and I would have said it myself, but I didn't know what Facebook was, and I still don't," the actress said Wednesday at the Television Critics Association's winter meeting.White landed the "SNL" gig thanks to a popular campaign on Facebook.She admitted she doesn't own a computer, forcing "Hot in Cleveland" co-star Valerie Bertinelli to call White instead of e-mailing her."I get a lot of mail, but I can stack those in stacks and throw this stack out without answering, and then I get to this stack," White said. "But if I punched the button and stored something in a computer, I wouldn't sleep at night wondering what was stored in there. I'm a technological spaz."White turns 89 on Jan. 17, and will be feted at a birthday bash in New York. She's enjoying a career resurgence, with "Hot in Cleveland" set to begin its second season Jan. 19 on TV Land."You've had such an overdose of me lately," she said. "I'm trying to cut down. I really am."At the same time, White finds it difficult to stay home."You spend your career thinking if you say no, they'll never ask you again, and if you don't take the job that may be the end of it," she said. "My mother taught me to say no when I was a girl, but that wasn't about show business."Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
