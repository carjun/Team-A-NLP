Ms. Giffords, 40, was described as being in very critical condition at the University Medical Center in Tucson, where she was operated on by a team of neurosurgeons. Dr. Peter Rhee, medical director of the hospital's trauma and critical care unit, said that she had been shot once in the head, "through and through," with the bullet going through her brain. "I can tell you at this time, I am very optimistic about her recovery," Dr. Rhee said in a news conference. "We cannot tell what kind of recovery but I'm as optimistic as it can get in this kind of situation." Early into the evening, there was still confusion about the number who were killed. An official with the Pima County Sheriff's Department said that six people had been killed, including a child about 9 years old and John M. Roll, the chief judge for the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. President Obama said in a news conference that at least five had died, including the child and Judge Roll. The Sheriff's Department said that a total of 19 were wounded, with the hospital confirming that 10 had been taken there. Mr. Obama confirmed that a suspect was in custody and said that the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation <b>...</b>President Obama on the Arizona Attack and Rep.

Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head Saturday when an assailant opened fire outside a grocery store during a meeting with constituents, killing at least five people and wounding several others in a rampage that rattled the nation. Giffords was among at least 10 people wounded, and the hospital said her outlook was "optimistic" and that she was responding to commands from doctors despite having a bullet go through her head. The hospital said a 9-year-old child was among the dead, and a US Marshal said a federal judge was also fatally shot in the attack. Giffords spokesman CJ Karamargin said an unspecified number of her staff members were injured in the shooting. Congressional officials said an aide to the Democrat was killed, and President Barack Obama said five people died in all. The reaction to the shooting was swift and rippled across the globe. Obama held a nationally televised news conference to express his condolences. The shooting cast a pall over Capitol as politicians of all stripes denounced the shooting as a horrific act of violence. Capitol police asked members of Congress to step up security in the wake of the shooting, and some politicians expressed hope that the killing spree serves as a wakeup call at a time when the political climate has become so emotionally charged. "I am horrified by the senseless attack on Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and members of her staff," newly elected House Speaker John Boehner said.

In all, six people died and 12 were wounded in the shooting, including US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, according to Rick Kastigar, bureau chief for the Pima County Sheriff's Department. President Barack Obama later said Chief Judge John Roll of the US District Court for Arizona was among the dead. A 9-year-old girl also died in the attack, according to authorities. The child, whose identity had not been released, was pronounced dead at a hospital. An Arizona law enforcement source and a federal law enforcement source identified the suspect as Jared Lee Loughner. Other law enforcement sources put his age at 22. US Capitol Police said the suspect was in custody. Police recovered a 9mm Glock handgun, according to senior law enforcement sources. Dr. Peter Rhee of University Medical Center in Tucson, said Giffords, 40, had undergone surgery for a single gunshot to the head that passed through her brain. Giffords was among five patients listed in critical condition, Rhee said. At least two victims with gunshot wounds were transported to another hospital, Northwest Medical Center, according to spokesman Richard Parker.

Professor Eugene Randell, Deputy Director of the Smithsonian Institution Archives has released information pertaining to the up and coming US elections. The Institute which holds some very rare Nostradamus manuscripts, believes that some of the quatrains written by the 16th century soothsayer are very close to describing the fight for the White House that is happening now. "We have the only existing fourth edition of Nostradamus' book Les Propheties (The Prophecies). There were thought to be only three editions published in 1558, this new edition is from 1559 and includes 20 more quatrains which have never been revealed before -- that is, until now," Professor Randell said from the archive office on Tuesday. Nostradamus has been credited with predicting numerous events in world history, from the Great Fire of London, the rise of Napoleon I of France, the French Revolution and Adolf Hitler, to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. The professor told the Daily Squib that it is well known that some of the quatrains are open to interpretation however what he has translated from the previously unreleased manuscript will certainly "ruffle a few feathers". 243 The great empire will be torn from limb, The all-powerful one for more than four hundred years: Great <b>...</b>ARIZONA SHOOTING 1/8/11 SOCIALISTS CALLING FOR REVOLUTION and VIOLENCE 2011 Jared LoughnerOrder: ReorderDuration: 4:32Published: 2011-01-04Uploaded: 2011-01-10Author: hager3030http://wn.com/ARIZONA_SHOOTING_1/8/11_SOCIALISTS_CALLING_FOR_REVOLUTION_and_VIOLENCE_2011_Jared_LoughnerEmail this videoSms this videoUPDATE: 420pm CST On Jared Lee Loughner's YouTube page, it lists his favorite books. Everything on the page is written in the past tense, as in "I attended school", "My favorite interest was reading and I studied grammar", "I had favorite books". Two of those favorite books of Loughner's were "Mein Kampf" and "The Communist Manifesto". No matter how hard the Left and media (redundancy alert!) try to spin this as a Tea Party attack, no Tea Party supporter agress with either Mein Kampf or the Communist Manifesto. Those two books belong on a shelf with the ravings of William Ayers, Jeremiah Wright, and other anti-American writers favored by the current White House and the Left (redundancy alert!), not those who support the Tea Party. 22-year old anarchists who "favorite" flag burning, the Communist Manifesto, and Mein Kampf are not part of the Tea Party.
