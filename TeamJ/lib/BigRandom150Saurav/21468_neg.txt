But if there are blockages in this life force because of which it does not flow it results in disharmonies in life. According to Astrology, the position or effects of planets in the horoscope are responsible for these blockages. The malefic effects of planets in our life can be remedied by chanting the mantras related to those planets, performing puja's or by wearing suitable gemstones related to the planets because of the healing properties gemstones possess. There are nine stones related to the nine planets and several sub stones which are mentioned in Vedic literature.Gems have been in existence from time immemorial. The proof of that is the mention of kaushtaba mani on the chest of Lord Vishnu and the mention of gemstones in the Book of Exodus in the Bible. For thousands of years gems have been used in Ayurveda in the form of powders for treating diseases and for physical healing because of its ability to release toxins and negative energies from the human body. Gems are used to make beautiful jewels and as a mode of displaying wealth. According to Astrology each zodiac sign is ruled by a planet and the cosmic vibrations of the planets affects our life. The Gemstones related to the planet absorb or reflect the vibration of the planet they are related to which means if a person is suffering from the malefic effect of a planet it can be remedied by wearing the correct stone which can counteract the negative effects and allow only the positive effects reach the individual.
