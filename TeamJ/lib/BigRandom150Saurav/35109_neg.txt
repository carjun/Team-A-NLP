Still pretty big though. 3 years agoflag  reply0zoso1001for once, Discovery Channel pales in comparison. this makes me wonder about all the other freakishly mutant species out there...like Llama beetles or pygmy crickets. the camel spider reminds me of The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror VIII episode, in which Bart becomes half-boy, half-fly, thanks to Professor Frink's before-its-time transporter. hmmm....what does the army know that we don't? 3 years agoflag  reply0james_bondmy spider is bigger than yours!i should really get a new username.-Marvin 3 years agoflag  reply0sgwhitesAnd up until now, I wasn't afraid of spiders.   3 years agoflag  reply0AaaaaaaahDoes this mean that al-Qaeda is really a giant arachnid?

Just kidding  3 years agoflag  reply0sloanWow. Totally desert-colored. It's almost as if they evolved to be able to sneak across the dunes and into F-16s. Well, saber-toothed F-16s back in the day, probably. 3 years agoflag  reply0shirin88Thanks Andrew for the nightmares I'll have tonight.  Much appreciated.   3 years agoflag  reply0jsaracothis feels very Indiana Jones to me for some reason...like something the Nazi's would've done as Indy prepared to leave Kabul with a F-16 full of poppy or something. 3 years agoflag  reply0khsingDon't they train people for this kind of stuff?
