Roll, a 1990 alum of the Law School's Graduate Program for Judges, was among the victims in the fatal shooting this weekend in Tucson, Ariz.      Friends and colleagues recall Judge Roll as a fair-minded jurist and advocate for his court. "Judge Roll was among the many distinguished judges who  came to our Graduate Program for Judges to earn a master's degree from the  University of Virginia. Like all the participants in this program, he took his  own vacation time to attend classes at the Law School for two summers, and then  he spent countless hours writing a master's thesis while he managed a full  caseload as a judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals," said Professor George Rutherglen, who taught the judges in the Class of 1990 and later became director of the Judges Program. Roll was subsequently  appointed to the U.S. District Court by President H. W. Bush. His thesis became  the basis for a law review article, "Merit Selection of Judges: The Arizona  Experience," which appeared in the Arizona State Law Journal. "'Merit'      sums up the career of Judge Roll, whose dedication to the  craft of judging was evident in everything he did throughout his judicial  career," said Rutherglen. "His participation in our program is typical and the program itself  benefited from his presence, as did everyone who came to know him here at our  law school  the faculty, his classmates and other graduates of the program. With the rest of the nation, those of us associated with  the University of Virginia mourn his death and the loss that it represents  for  the judicial system, for the legal profession and for our country."
