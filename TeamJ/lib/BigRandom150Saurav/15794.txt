Dr. King grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, where his father was a preacher. The boy quickly turned into a man and followed in his father's footsteps. He became involved in the civil rights movement after Rosa Parks took her infamous bus ride in 1955, and his speeches, marches and causes were, and continue to be, an inspiration to millions. Where in the stars can we see King's world-changing personality?Birth Details:January 15, 1929Atlanta, Georgia'I have a dream,' said King in his most famous speech. Indeed, his Capricorn Sun wouldn't have it any other way. Capricorns can be very strong when they need to be, and such was the case with King. He was, and is, a great representative of his cause. His ambition and long-term plan made him a leader, someone to be looked up to during the long, hard fight toward freedom and equality for all people. His Sun squares Jupiter, which governs ideals, philosophy and religion. Though his beliefs and religious faith were very strong, they were also very challenging. He constantly had to fight opposition to make his point.A Pisces Moon further explains his dreamer's mind. Dr. King was very creative, intuitive and idealistic. He had his own unique perception of reality -- his ideas about nonviolent social change, though influenced by those of Mahatma Gandhi, were still considered radical in his time. A Pisces Moon also adds a sense of self-sacrifice to this picture. Indeed, the reverend risked his life repeatedly, took police beatings and was arrested 30 times during his fight for what he thought was right. He made the ultimate sacrifice in 1968 when he was assassinated during a trip to Memphis, Tennessee, where he was going to lead sanitation workers in a protest against intolerable pay and conditions.On the communication front, Dr. King was definitely one of the best speakers of all time. His Mercury in Aquarius lent his speech its forward-thinking and original impact, a spark that carried through to the way he thought as well. There are few who ever heard him speak, in life or through a recording, who can forget the effect of his booming preacher's voice. Aquarius is the sign of the philanthropist, and King's views on equality, unity and the somebodiness of all people were right on target.For Dr. King, Venus, the planet of love, is in Pisces along with his Moon. Pisces is the sign of compassion, sensitivity and imagination. This reinforces the fact that he indeed had a dream and was not afraid to chase it. He was not what anyone would call macho; he could, in fact, be considered a sensitive guy. His wife, Coretta Scott, and their four children would probably concur, adding that his strength never came from force or brutality, but from inner peace and a desire for positive change.With Mars in Gemini, the reverend was articulate, quick-thinking and intellectual. Indeed, he skipped two years of grade school, entered college at age 15 and was ordained a minister at the tender age of 19. In speech and in thought, he was all one could ask for in a leader: witty, clever, dexterous and unbeatable in a debate. The world suffered a true loss when King was assassinated.Birth data source: AstroDatabankDo you dream of being rich and famous like your favorite celebrity?
