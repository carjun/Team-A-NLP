Yet the author, J K Rowling, with all of her prowess as an author wore the most severe dark blood red lacquered finger polish covering each fingernail as if in reenactment of the evil wardrobe accessory of the Harry Potters make believe characters. Even though J K Rowling has been attributed to increasing literacy because of the fact that more children are reading books because of Harry Potter series of novels, she could not seem to get the coloring of her fingernails to match or near match that of her lipstick. The pale neutral lipstick color looked too light in color, in comparison to her dark bewitching blood red fingernails. Whenever J K Rowling made a point to Oparh about her famous writing career, the childrens book author would flash the dark blood red fingernails with widened pale hands as if to frighten the over excited acting Oprah. It is quite amazing that a billionaire can not get right what an average teenager would find as easy as pie and that is matching her fingernails to as near a color of the lipstick as possible. Sure, J K Rowling is a famous writer from Scotland and no one should even be concerned about something as superficial as the fingernail color and the lip color contrasting so much. But each time J K Rowling would gesture with her dark blood red fingernails at Oprah Winfrey, it would seem as if one of the witches had escaped from the Harry Potter novels and was about to attack Oprah who sat directly across from J K Rowling. Oprah Winfrey was probably so unaware of the fashion mistake because she was happy to meet a woman of an equal billionaire net worth.Oprah does not wear fingernail polish but does wear lipstick. So Oprah was clear of any fashion fallacies when it came to matching or near matching fingernail color and lip color. Surely J K Rowling of billionaire financial status could afford a trip to a Scottish nail salon to slap on a fresh pair of acrylic nails or to have a French manicure set with clear fingernail polish. Yet, J K Rowlings continued to flash those dark blood red fingernails as she gestured at each of the questions that Oprah tried to render like an experienced Barbara Walters or as classic as former Good Morning America co host Dianne Sawyer.The teenage girls or fashion gurus watching the J K Rowling interview with Oprah Winfrey would have been happy to know that she had on very high heeled pumps of a neutral color, the hue of which would have fared better on her fingernails than having painted on that dark eerie blood red polish. J K Rowling, upon a closer examination, wore a gray sheath dress of knee length but was careful to cover her mid section that could have used a few sit-ups, as many people would attest to. Oprah people must do research on guest's favorite colors who Oprah interviews because J K Rowling dress color if not her favorite color matched Oprahs of course stretchable gray pants, gray front tie sweater that was worn above a white shirt. The collar of the white shirt that Oprah wore under the gray front tie sweater with waistline missing in action, had to be scrutinized to see if Oprahs people forgot to iron it. Former GMAs co host Dianne Sawyers signature white blouse always look as if brand new or freshly adorned from the television cleaners is they have one. So Oprahs people need to take a closer look at how they dress the Queen of talk. Also J K Rowlings people if she has people in her entourage needs to rethink the coloring of her dark blood red lacquered finger nails and also maybe that necklace she was wearing of a sorcerer holding a sword. Although J K Rowling is the billionaire author of the Harry Potter novel series and merchandising empire, the necklace that was not symmetrical in the least was not a feminine fashion accessory. The Harry Potters financial empire is so huge that J K Rowling, although the author and is of course proud of the work, did not need to advertise wearing the seemingly cheap plastic circle medallion with the sorcerer holding a sword.Most people know the story of the single Mom that J K Rowling was until she hit pay dirt when she wrote the Harry Potters series of novels. The Harry Potter novel J K Rowling was discussing on the Oprah Winfrey show was to be her last and this was to be Oprah Winfreys last television season of talk. Gray is seemingly a sad color and this could have been the reason that J K Rowling and Oprah Winfrey both chose to wear gray on this particular interview. But there is no excuse for the dark blood red lacquered fingernail polish that J K Rowlings wore on the Oprah Show that contrasted so miserably with her neutral lipstick color. Good job on hiding the wide midriff J K Rowlings by folding the arms at the right angle for the television cameras and also hurray for being fit enough to wear those stylish sky high heel pumps, nice legs by the way. However, if there is another interview, J K Rowlings keep the hands down and do not gesture to your interviewer if the choice is again to wear the dark blood red lacquered painted fingernails on pale hands or the interviewer will have to dodge with the skill that Harry Potter flies on that flying broom.vote upvote downsharePrintflagWas this Hub ...?

Your comment is greatly appreciated.lindagoffigan3 months ago SteveoMc, thank you for your comment. Your take on the hub about J K Rowling on Oprah as being humorous is well received.  As you can ascertain from the  previous comments, the writers were probably fans of the Harry Potter writer and took the hub a little too seriously.Aris Budianto3 months ago Every word should be appreciated, don't be too serious, anyway funny hub, thankslindagoffigan3 months ago Aris Budianto, thank you for your comment.Joyce3 months ago I actually adored what she was wearing, it all seemed very well put together. The red nails put a certain pop of color into the outfit. I don't agree with this article, and actually, I think it's very superficial. Jo is an amazing woman, and all you can focus on is her nail color?lindagoffigan3 months ago Joyce, thank you for the comment.  You have to admit that the color worn by Oprah and Rowling was a drabgray.  I loved the shoes but the fingernail polish was grotesque. I stand by this article and I focus on her nail color because that is where most of the readers can compete unless there are more Oprahs out there.Submit a CommentMembers and GuestsSign in or sign up and post using a hubpages account.Name:URL: optionalComment:No HTML is allowed in comments, but URLs will be hyperlinkedComments are not for promoting your Hubs or other sites94lindagoffiganFrom Phoenix, Arizona1043 Followers1705 HubsJoined 24 months agoRead more hubs by lindagoffiganFollow lindagoffiganSubscribe to lindagoffigan's RSS feed Ask a QuestionAsk lindagoffigan a question based on this Hub.Related QuestionsWhen A Man Says A Woman Has Big And Wide Lips, What Is He Visualizing?asked by ngureco 12 months ago3 answersAnswer this questionLadies, what is the best way to grow out gray hair?asked by Live Work Dream 16 months ago4 answersAnswer this questionRelated HubsRed Lipstick Says !!!!by Rhonda WaitsHow To Wear Red Lipstick This Seasonby Hope AlexanderBeauty Aids and Home Remedies For Everyday Herbs and Spicesby angela_michelleWhat your Fingernails reveal about your Healthby Research AnalystWhy You Should Read Harry Potterby M.
