The rest of us wait, and ponder some aspects of this:1. Last winter, Boras negotiated a two-year, $36.2 million deal for Andruw Jones, structured in such a way so the agent could say Jones was making more, per year, than the $18 million annual salary received by another center fielder, Torii Hunter. At the time Jones signed the deal, of course, there was no mention of the fact the contract included deferred money that actually took the present-day value below what Hunter is earning.But now, in the current situation, Manny's representation is clearly fighting to make the case, through reporters, that the Dodgers' $45 million offer isn't really $45 million, because of the deferred money. In other words: Deferred money only counts as real money if and when it's useful for Boras to say it counts as real money.2. The Dodgers' offer to Ramirez of $45 million over two years would have a present-day value of about $41 million, executives with rival teams estimate, because of the thick layers of deferred money in the contract. In the first year of the contract, the present-day value would be about $22.5 million -- which is more than the combined base salaries in 2009 of Bobby Abreu, Orlando Hudson, Pat Burrell, Joe Crede, Cliff Floyd, Mark Loretta and Takashi Saito.The Dodgers' negotiating strategy remains sound: They should simply sit on their offer, because there is absolutely nothing in the market -- certainly not the depressed free-agent prices, in an economy which seems to get worse by the day -- that should nudge them to go way beyond where they are. They have the highest offer on the table, and they will continue to have the highest offer on the table, right up until the moment Ramirez decides whether or not he wants to play baseball at the Dodgers' price.3. I wrote here the other day that I don't think Boras misread the market, because Ramirez probably never had the leverage he thought he had, a problem that stems from his ugly exit from Boston. But it should be noted, as Boras now works to inflate the Dodgers' one- and two-year offers, that Ramirez and his agent have already missed the best chance to get the most money in 2009. The Dodgers offered Ramirez arbitration back in November, and coming off his staggering, historic performance of August and September, Ramirez might have been in position to make a case for $25 million -- or more -- in present-day money had he accepted the arbitration offer.4. The Giants are perfectly positioned for the rebound date, by the way. If Manny gets so angry and frustrated with the Dodgers that he decides to break up with them, the Giants will be there for him (with less money, yes, but offering emotional support and an opportunity for Manny to stick it directly to L.A.). The Giants' Bill Neukom isn't ruling out anything, Andrew Baggarly writes.The Dodgers' feud with Ramirez has gotten very public, writes Bill Shaikin. Boras and Frank McCourt are playing a dangerous game, writes Bill Plaschke.The Ramirez saga is best enjoyed from afar, writes Bruce Jenkins.

He began covering baseball in 1989, as the Nashville Banner's beat reporter assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Later, he covered the San Diego Padres (1993-94), the Baltimore Orioles ('95-96), the New York Mets ('97) and the Yankees ('98-2001). Olney joined ESPN The Magazine in 2003, after six years at The New York Times, and he's the author of the Times' best-seller "The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty," a book about the Paul O'Neill-Tino Martinez Yankees dynasty of 1996-01.He grew up in central Vermont collecting baseball cards and listening to Red Sox, Expos, Phillies and Pirates radio broadcasts, and was a rabid fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He graduated from Vanderbilt University the same year as hoops legend Will Perdue, and ranks among the all-time leading scorers in pickup basketball at Memorial Gym. He claims to have witnessed the Commodores' winning football season in 1982 (although anthropologists have not yet confirmed this).Olney also contributes to ESPN.com, ESPN Radio, ESPNEWS, "SportsCenter" and "Baseball Tonight."Follow Buster on Twitter: @Buster_ESPNSend questions and comments SUBSCRIBE:Subscribe to this blog's RSSFollow this blog on TwitterBLOG ARCHIVE:Select OneJanuary 2011 (7)December 2010 (21)November 2010 (21)October 2010 (26)September 2010 (25)August 2010 (25)July 2010 (25)June 2010 (23)May 2010 (25)April 2010 (20)March 2010 (26)February 2010 (22)January 2010 (21)December 2009 (27)November 2009 (20)October 2009 (26)September 2009 (25)August 2009 (20)July 2009 (28)June 2009 (26)May 2009 (26)April 2009 (25)March 2009 (27)February 2009 (24)January 2009 (28)December 2008 (46)November 2008 (20)October 2008 (27)September 2008 (25)August 2008 (25)July 2008 (55)June 2008 (25)May 2008 (24)April 2008 (4)April 2006 (1)RECENT UPDATESThe baseball side of Tucson tragedy(1/9/2011 8:41 AM ET)Analyzing the Matt Garza deal(1/8/2011 9:06 AM ET)The most controversial vote(1/6/2011 8:07 AM ET)Searching for Aubrey Huff(1/5/2011 7:52 AM ET)Michael Young's options market(1/4/2011 7:54 AM ET)LINKSUSSportspagesNew York TimesNew York PostNewsdayNew York Daily NewsBoston GlobeBoston HeraldBaltimore SunMyESPNNFLMLBNBANHLNCAA FBNCAA BBNASCARSOCCERGOLFTENNISBOXINGMMAMORE SPORTSRADIO& MOREPAGE 2& COMMENTARYFANTASY& GAMESWATCHMLB HomeScheduleStandingsStatsTeamsAL EastBaltimore OriolesBoston Red SoxNew York YankeesTampa Bay RaysToronto Blue JaysAL CentralChicago White SoxCleveland IndiansDetroit TigersKansas City RoyalsMinnesota TwinsAL WestLos Angeles AngelsOakland AthleticsSeattle MarinersTexas RangersNL EastAtlanta BravesFlorida MarlinsNew York MetsPhiladelphia PhilliesWashington NationalsNL CentralChicago CubsCincinnati RedsHouston AstrosMilwaukee BrewersPittsburgh PiratesSt. Louis CardinalsNL WestArizona DiamondbacksColorado RockiesLos Angeles DodgersSan Diego PadresSan Francisco GiantsPlayersFantasyTransactionsLocalBBTN Hot StoveWinter LeaguesResources2010 SeasonAttendanceBeane CountCareer AssessmentsCloser ReportCy Young PredictorDaily LeadersDebutsFree AgentsGame Projections Hitting StreaksHome Run TrackerHunt for OctoberInjuriesKey DatesLifersLocalManagersNews WirePark FactorsPick Center Pitching ProbablesPlayer RatingsPodcast: Baseball TodayRadio scheduleRookie StatsRoster AnalysisStadium GuidesTop PerformancesTV scheduleTopicsTommy John SurgeryGeorge SteinbrennerSteroid EraMcCourt Divorce TrialEvents2010 MLB Postseason2010 Hall of Fame2010 All-Star Game2010 First-Year Player Draft2010 Season Preview2010 Spring TrainingHistoryAll-Star Game HistoryAwardsCommissionersDraft HistoryFranchise HistoriesHall of FamersHistorical LeadersHistory home pageNo-HittersSeason-By-Season HistoryTriple CrownsWorld Series HistoryRumorsESPN.com: Help | PR Media Kit | Advertise On ESPN.com | Sales Media Kit | Interest-Based Ads | Corrections | Contact Us | Site Map | Shop | Jobs at ESPN | Supplier Information2010 ESPN Internet Ventures.
