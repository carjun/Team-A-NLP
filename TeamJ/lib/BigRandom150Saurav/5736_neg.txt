(AP) - The number of people who died in car and truck accidents in Wisconsin dropped in 2010, but more pedestrians and people riding bikes and motorcycles were killed.State Department of Transportation figures show that although the number of fatalities increased last year, it was well below the 5-year average. Transportation officials say 564 people died on Wisconsin roads last year. Motorcycle fatalities increased from 84 in 2009 to 104 last year. State Patrol Major Dan Lonsdorf attributes the increased number to the economy. He says more people may be riding motorcycles to save on gas.The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel says the last time there were fewer than 600 traffic deaths for three consecutive years was 1942-1944. That's when gas rationing drastically reduced travel.Information from: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, http://www.jsonline.comCopyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
