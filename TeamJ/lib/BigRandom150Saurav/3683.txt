Nine out of 10 are on Long Island, and the top 30 are all in the New York metro area.    After 24 years at Commack's School District, retiring Superintendent James Feltman posted a letter on the internet saying he had much to be thankful for.  You could say that again.

That makes him the highest paid public school employee, in the entire state!  "My taxes are enough where some of his money should be coming back my way," said one resident.  When he retired, Feltman's contract allowed him to be paid for more than two decades worth of unused sick time.     But his actual salary last year was still $363,000.  If you live in his district, he's far from the only person making a bundle on your dime.  An assistant principal earned $310,000.     A language teacher earned $251,000.     By comparison, outgoing New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein made $250,000 last year to run the nation's largest school system of 1.1 million students.     Commack teaches just 7,700 students.  "Unless everyone gets together and says we're not going to take it anymore, this is what's going to happen," a resident said.  The numbers, were tabulated by the Empire Center for NYS Policy, and shows that 9 of the top 10 earners, and 30 of the top 50, work on Long Island.  As for number one, James Felting, he wasn't home Wednesday and doesn't seem to live a terribly lavish lifestyle.  "No he's living very modestly.  If I was him I'd be out of here, I'd be living down in Palm Beach or something," said his neighbor, Tom Green.  Green says Felting has been traveling a lot since retiring.     In that online letter, he said he was leaving Commack with "many fond memories" and apparently, a very nice nest egg.
