There are so many dumb and simple people in the USA, it makes me wonder how this country became the richest in the world- perhaps that is mainly due to its heavily exploitive past and bullying to the rest of the globe, etc...We don't need to spend any more money on defense. "Hey Mr. President, how about spending that money on health care which you claim to be so adamant in restructuring. Gee, and how about giving the troops the correct and adequate armor they need to do the job, instead of sending them out on the field totally ill equipped?" This president is such a two-faced fake. And his convictions are about as stable as a fart in a wind storm. 1 year agoflag  reply0JonRaymondhttp://current.com/items/91595807_pressure-is-already-on-congress-to-get-out-of-...The heat is on 1 year agoflag  replymore fromNews:Michael Vick More Important to Obama Than Family of Soldier Killed In Combat The #1 Work From Home Business Of 2011 . . .
