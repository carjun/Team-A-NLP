And Price is doing it again, only this time you can choose where he starts. Then, next Thursday, the CBS weather guy hits the road.TVNewser spoke with Price about the trip including what happens when he runs out of money. (Hint: he sleeps near a Las Vegas hotel swimming pool after blowing his cash in the casino).  But we began by talking about his recent life change:TVNewser: You got married this Summer, what does your wife think of you leaving soon? Dave Price: In all the time Ive know my wife and dated my wife Jackelyn, Ive been on the road. Ive been on the road what seems like half the time, 30% of the time, all over the country. But Jackelyn is really busy herself. Shes a partner in a real estate consulting firm. So shes here, there and everywhere. The concerning thing is if she starts tweeting me and telling me to take my time getting across the country. But other than that, shes been really supportive. I love being married, but its a challenge to just get married, and then be on the road like this.TVNewser: What city are you excited about this year?Dave Price: Last year, what we decided was The Early Show was going to drop me in Sana Monica, Calif., and I would have seven days to find my way home with nothing but $50, a backpack full of gear (computers blackberries, etc), and I needed to figure out a way to get back to the corner of 59th and 5th avenue in seven days by earning an honest days pay for an honest days work and using social media to garner favors in order to weave my way back home. This year, the difference is that our viewers are deciding where I start. So it could be anywhere from the San Diego Zoo to San Francisco to Newport, Oregon to Seattle, Washington, all the way out to Anchorage, Alaska. All of them provide their own unique challenges. Im afraid of getting excited about one place or another, because I dont know where Im going to wind up.TVNewser: Do you do anything to prepare for the trip?Dave Price: If I start in a place like San Diego, tactically speaking, Ill probably journey a southern route if I can across the country. If I start in Northern California/Oregon/Seattle/Alaska, its a northerly route. I have to take into account topography, the climate, and the viability of getting from one place to another in seven days.TVNewser: How does your expertise as a CBS weather anchor help you on these trips?

Weve been covering it, executive producer David Friedman told TVNewser, But when you put an anchor there, it makes it feel more important to people.For Mondays broadcast, Weather anchor Dave Price as well as contributing doctors Jennifer Ashton and Deb Turner Bell were dispatched to the region.This was a story we spent so much time covering and we felt like day 50 was something that we should be there for, Friedman said, explaining that plans had been put into motion over the weekend with Smith flying out after Mondays show.  CBS announced Monday that the networks evening and morning shows would be anchored from the region weekly. Our feeling is that the story is such a big story, everyone is watching and caring about it, as they should, and we felt like were going to give it as much attention as possible.Friedman says hes been working closely with Evening News EP Rick Kaplan to coordinate, but admits that the morning show format does present some challenges.The difference is in evening news, its a little bit easier to cover your broadcast: its only 30 minutes and most of the broadcast is designated to that coverage, Friedman explains. With the morning shows, theyre two hours long.  And you start with oil and end with cooking.  Its a weird thing.  You have Harry Smith in the Gulf, but then you still have to do the lifestyle, fitness, cooking segments.  And yes, you have Harry in a place where hes out of pocket for those, but we have the people to cover us. CBS named Friedman EP late last year, and he started in January, going from producing Lady Gaga performances and NBCs New Years Eve broadcast to producing CBS morning coverage of the earthquake in Haiti just a few weeks later.We chatted with the new boss about how The Early Show is changing and his transition to what he calls the best job in television with the worst hours ever.
