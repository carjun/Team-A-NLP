Wikipedia:Template messages - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWikipedia:Template messagesFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia(Redirected from Wikipedia:Template)Jump to: navigation,searchFor information on what templates are and how the template namespace is intended to be used, see Wikipedia:Template namespace.  For information on template development, see Help:Template.  For the project team looking after templates on Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Templates."WP:TM" redirects here. For the Wikipedia Manual of Style section on trademarks, see MOS:TM."WP:TEMP" redirects here. For temporary subpages, see WP:SUBPAGE.Shortcuts:WP:TMWP:TEMPWP:TEMPLATEThis page provides an index for a wide range of standard templates in use within Wikipedia. Whether you are providing a custom message or a pastel box or are flagging articles, adding tags, or adding templates, this page also gives an overview of what subjects are covered within each heading.There are two main ways to use templates on articles: transclusion (also called "inclusion", and accomplished by using {{Template name}}), and subclusion (also called "substitution"). The former will include the content of {{Template Name}} on the fly whenever the article is loaded, while the latter will permanently insert the content of the template into the article. With substitution, even if the template content is modified at a later date, the article's content will not change. The common method for using template messages is transclusion, implemented by usage of a tag with the form {{template name}}, in whatever article or talk page one wants the template code/text to be shown. A less common usage is to implement an automatic one-time copying of a template's code/text to the location of a template tag; a method called substitution or subclusion, implemented simply by adding subst: as a prefix for the template name (as in {{subst:template name}}).Substitution is the preferred method for permanent notices (i.e., no probability that it will change) because it is less confusing, and it even helps to lighten the load on the database. Substitution has the further advantage in that a template's content may be de-linked from any associated category or slightly modified to suit the circumstances, such as when the template is used on a talk page. Transclusion is preferred for displaying material that is normally updated (i.e., high probability that it will change), that way, all the places it appears are updated in a single operation.Contents1 Using this page2 Can improvements be made easily?3 Article-related namespace3.1 General3.2 Sources/ citations/ references3.3 Links3.4 Cleanup3.5 Deletion/ renaming/ discussion3.6 Disputes and warnings3.7 Maintenance3.8 Wikimedia sister projects3.9 Compact tables of contents (TOC)3.10 Lists3.11 Redirect pages3.12 Standard boxes3.13 Formatting4 Non article-related namespace4.1 Wikipedia namespace4.2 Category namespace4.3 User namespace4.4 User talk namespace4.5 Talk namespace4.6 File namespace4.7 Template namespace5 Related pages for specific types of templates6 See alsoUsing this pageThe bold links at the top of each cell lead to detailed pages which describe the templates in that section in detail and explain how and when to use them.If you cannot find the template you are looking for, please click on the section headers that seem most relevant, since there may be templates for a particular usage covered on the detailed pages, but not listed in the table below.If, after searching, you still cannot find the template you need, you can request it on Wikipedia:Requested templates. For help on creating templates, see Help:Template or contact a user who has identified himself or herself as an adept template coder. Note that in order to maintain consistent design of templates, there have been significant discussions about a variety of templates at both Wikipedia talk:Article message boxes and Wikipedia talk:Talk page templates.A more comprehensive category system may also be viewed at Category:Wikipedia templates.Can improvements be made easily?Before placing templates on a page, it is worthwhile to cast a critical eye over the page to determine whether or not the improvements could be made easily, thus eliminating the need for a tag.Article-related namespacePlease list navigational templates (as, for example, between pages relating to a specific topic) at Wikipedia:Navigation templates or at the appropriate WikiProject page.GeneralDisambiguation and redirectionSectionTiming-related (Current
