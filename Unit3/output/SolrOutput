Image: Patrick Semansky/Associated Press\nBy Andrew Freedman2014-08-13 15:38:21 UTC\n\n\nThe same unusually strong August storm system that brought five to eight inches of rain to the Detroit area on Monday night, paralyzing travel and flooding homes and businesses, dumped an entire summer's worth of rainfall on one Long Island town in just a few hours on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.\nIn the New York City metro area early Wednesday, more than a foot of rain fell in just a few hours, causing extensive flooding on Long Island. As of 10 a.m. ET, Islip, New York had received 13.27 inches of rain, which set a preliminary state record for the heaviest 24-hour rainfall total in state history. This broke the previous record of 11.6 inches, set at Tannserville, New York in August of 2011 during Hurricane Irene. \nThe pace of the rain was extreme, as Islip picked up 5.34 inches of rain between 5 and 6 a.m. ET, and another 4.37 inches in the following hour. \n\nSuffolk and Nassau Counties, New York were hardest hit. In addition to the jackpot at Islip Macarthur Airport, West Islip received 11.5 inches of rain, also in under 24 hours. To put this rainfall into perspective, consider that in a typical summer from June through July, Islip sees 11.75 inches of rain.\nIn addition, the rainfall record for the entire month of August is 13.78 inches, which means that Islip is tantalizingly close to setting a monthly rainfall record in less than 24-hours. The wettest single month on record there is 14.07 inches, set in October 2005, according to weather.com. \nSuch rainfall amounts are typically associated with tropical storms and hurricanes in the Mid-Atlantic states.\n\nThe heavy rain band slammed Long Island this AM.

The all-time daily rainfall record there rains the 7.62 inches of rain that fell during the Great Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane of 1933, the National Weather Service said. \nThe town of Green Haven, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, recorded 10.32 inches of rain on Tuesday.\n\nLoop of total precipitable water across the Atlantic, showing a surge in moisture (orange) from the tropics to the Mid-Atlantic on August 12-13.Image:  University of WisconsinThe storm system that sparked the heavy rains was unusual for the month of August because it had all the ingredients of a spring or fall storm — a strong low pressure area over the Great Lakes that reformed over the Mid-Atlantic, a pool of cold air aloft that dove southward out of Canada, and a plume of moisture from the tropics known as a \"moist conveyor belt\" that acted like a highway bringing in dense, tropical air to the affected states.\n\nFlooding was severe in the areas that got the heaviest rainfall, with cars covered with water at the airport parking lots, streets made impassible, and water rescues taking place along creeks and rivers.\nThe narrow band of heaviest rainfall, within which several inches of rain fell in just a few hours, extended east into Delaware and then northeast across the Jersey coast. In Long Island, the deluge hit in the early morning hours on Wednesday, snarling the morning rush hour.\nThe NWS said that within the area of heaviest rainfall, the rainfall was coming down at rates \"exceeding four to five inches per hour.\" \nIn Nassau County, Wantagh received 7.84 inches, and Merrick had 6.81 inches. The deluge narrowly missed New York City, with Brooklyn picking up a little more than an inch of rain. \n\nWPIX-TV reported that fire crews in boats rescued drivers in the town of Nesconset. Weather forecasters had indicated for days that heavy rainfall was likely to occur across the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, but pinpointing exactly where the most rain would fall remains a forecast challenge more than a few hours ahead of time.\nAs was the case in Detroit, the rainfall that occurred from Baltimore north to Long Island (and is ongoing in New England) is an example of the type of events that are already occurring more frequently due to manmade global warming combined with natural climate variability. \n\n@JimCantore trying to get to my house in Holbrook, ny. Should have taken the boat to work pic.twitter.com/zVBQtIxKZY\n— alan krane (@Ligolfer) August 13, 2014\n\nSince the late 1950s, the heaviest rainfall events have become more common and more intense in much of the U.S., with the highest increase — 71% — occurring in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Scientists have attributed this in part to manmade global warming, since the atmosphere can hold more moisture at higher temperatures, and more evaporation is also taking place. \nThis means that storms, from localized thunderstorms to massive hurricanes, have more energy to work with, and are able to wring out greater amounts of rain or snow in heavy bursts. In general, more precipitation is now coming in shorter, heavier bursts compared to a few decades ago, and this is putting strain on urban infrastructure such as sewer systems that are unable to handle such sudden influxes of water.\n\nThis map shows percent increases in the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events (defined as the top 1% of all daily rainfall events) from 1958-2012.Image:  National Climate AssessmentAccording to Jeff Masters of Weather Underground, Monday's heavy rains mean that four out of 10 of Detroit's top 10 rainiest days on record have occurred during the past 17 years, and Tuesday's rains mean that three of Baltimore's top 10 rainiest days have occurred in just the past five years.\nSimilar extreme rainfall and flooding events also occurred this year in Pensacola, Florida, in Boulder, Colorado last year, as well as Calgary, Canada.\nThe Obama administration has proposed a $1 billion climate resilience fund aimed at helping communities adapt to climate change impacts that are already occurring, including heavy precipitation events. Studies, including the National Climate Assessment that was released in May, have found that the 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit increase in global average surface temperatures to date has already increased the odds of heavy precipitation events, heat waves, and coastal flooding in many areas.\n\n\nFlooding in the US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs lightning streaks across the stormy sky, motorists park in front of a washed out road in South Mountain Park as heavy rains caused flash flooding and stranded dozens of cars Aug. 12, 2014, in Phoenix. \n\nImage: Ross D.

Checkey Beckford reports\nThursday, Aug 14, 2014  Updated at 1:00 PM EDT\n\nCommunities on Long Island are drying out Thursday after a record-breaking storm drenched the region with torrential downfall, turning expressways and neighborhood streets into rivers that swallowed up cars and contributed to at least one death.\n\nAerial View of Flood-Wrecked Long Island\n\n\n\n\nChopper 4 tours some of the hardest-hit parts of Long Island after a historic storm dumped 13 inches of rain on Islip in 24 hours.\nCrews worked around the clock across Long Island to pump flood waters off expressways and neighborhood streets while families cleared out garages and ran sump pumps to pull water out of waterlogged crawl spaces and basements. The cleanup comes after a record-breaking deluge dumped more than a foot of rain in some places and led Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone to declare a state of emergency.\nBeloved Family Dog Swept Up in Floodwaters Found Dead\nIslip saw 13.88 inches of rain, smashing the town's single-day rainfall total and bringing its monthly rainfall total above its all-time record, set in 1990. The 13.88 inches of rain also beat the single-day rainfall record for the state, which was 11.6 inches, set in Tannersville the wake of Hurricane Irene on Aug. 28, 2011. \nOther towns in Suffolk County were heavy-hit by the storm, with Bay Shore, West Islip and Holbrook all also seeing more than 10 inches of rain, and several other areas in the county saw between 3 and 9 inches. Rain totals in part of Nassau County also topped 9 inches. \n\n\n\n\n\nPHOTOS: Flash Flooding on Long Island\n\n\nGov. Cuomo announced that a mobile command center would be set up in Islip Thursday to help homeowners and businesses with insurance claims. The command center will operate out of the Town Hall parking lot and will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., but homeowners can also call the state’s disaster hotline at 1-800-339-1759.\n\n@ajschaefer1 tweeted this photo with the post, \"The boys kayaking in our yard #longisland #flooding #flood #islip #monsoon #Monsoon2014.\" @ajschaefer1/Twitter \nLauren Bacall Dies in NYC at Age 89\nParts of the Jersey shore south of Atlantic City were also hard-hit by the storm, with record rains that caused flash flooding and forcing evacuations in Millville.\nNew York City and the suburbs to the north and west were spared from the brunt of the deluge, with the heaviest rain coming at John F. Kennedy Airport, where 3.26 inches fell.\nYonkers Cop to Attend Wedding of Baby He Saved\nMeanwhile, most major roads on Long Island have reopened after many were inundated with water Wednesday, causing flash floods that surprised drivers and stranded cars in several feet of water for hours.\nOne stretch of the Southern State Highway flooded so quickly Wednesday that it stranded more than 50 drivers, with firefighters having to come to the rescue. And in Bay Shore, crews worked throughout the afternoon Wednesday to clean out a massive sinkhole that opened up in part due to the torrential rains.\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR PHOTOS: Summery New York\n\n\nThe storm contributed to one traffic fatality, when a motorist swerved on the Long Island Expressway and hit a tractor-trailer and guardrail near Melville. The car burst into flames and the driver was pronounced dead at the scene. The tractor-trailer driver had minor injuries. No other injuries were reported.\nA dog that was swept away by floodwaters during a walk with its owners after the storm let up was found dead Thursday. \n\nMassive Sinkhole Opens Up in Shopping Center Lot\n\n\n\n\nA sinkhole opened up inside the Bay Shore Shopping Center parking lot on Long Island Tuesday, after heavy rains flooded the area. Stores in the area were evacuated, and officials are investigating the 10-by-12-feet sinkhole. \n\n\n\n\n\nExtreme Weather Photos\n\n\nResidents are working to bounce back, running sump pumps to drain basements and cleaning out waterlogged storage areas. Islip resident Frank Greco said Wednesday he was gearing up for a long slog, running his pump to clear out his crawl space.\n\"I've been pumping all day. I got four feet of water in my crawl space and I'm still pumping,\" Greco said. \"The sewers were so filled you couldn't keep up with the water coming in. It's coming up as fast as you can. It's all groundwater coming up.\"\n\n\nChris Christie Takes Ice Bucket Challenge\nDrivers throughout the region will also be trying to dry out cars that got stuck in floodwaters in hopes that they’ll start again. Christine Hoffken tried several times in vain to start her flooded vehicle Wednesday, but says she’s planning on borrowing her mother’s car to drive to work Thursday.\n“I’ve got to let her dry out for a few days and hopefully we’ll get her started and I won’t have to go buy a new car,” she said.\n\nWATCH: Driving Through Floods in West Babylon\n\n\n\n\nNBC 4 New York obtained video of someone driving in West Babylon as floodwaters rose.\nGet the latest from NBC 4 New York anywhere, anytime: iPhone/iPad App | Twitter | Facebook | Email Newsletters | Send Us News Tips | Google+ | Instagram | RSS\n\r\n\r\n                        \r\n\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \tCopyright Associated Press / NBC New York\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWSLETTERS\n\nReceive the latest local  updates in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy | More Newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Comments ()  |  Email\n | \nPrint\n\n\n\nLeave Comments\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\nLocal\nU.S. & World\nSports\nHealth\nTech\nWeird\nWeather\n\n\n\n\nWeather\nForecast\nMaps & Radar\nWeather Alerts\nSchool Closing Alerts\nWeather News\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\nEntertainment News\nThe Scene\nEvents\nIn The Wings\nNY Live\nYour Guide 4 NY\nOpen House\n1st Look\nTalk Stoop\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nSocial Directory\nAbout Us\nCommunity\nTV Listings\nNext Step for Vets\nCareers\n\n\n\n\nTraffic\nTraffic Cameras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Feedback|Terms Of Service New|Privacy Policy\n\n\n\nFCC Independent Programming Report\nFCC News and Information Programming Report\nNBC Non-Profit News Partnership Reports\nWNBC Public Inspection File\n21st Century Solutions\n\nAdChoices\n\n\n\r\n          © 2014 NBCUniversal Media, LLC.

There was at least one storm-related death in Melville, police said, and Suffolk officers had to swim to rescue a man Wednesday morning who had driven into 6-foot deep floodwaters on a Coram roadway.\nAs of Wednesday night, parts of Sunrise Highway, the Meadowbrook State Parkway, Ocean Parkway and the Robert Moses Causeway were still closed due to flooding.\nBut on the rails, the Long Island Rail Road was expected to operate a normal morning commute Thursday, with no planned cancellations or delays. A spokeswoman said some LIRR waiting rooms in Babylon branch train stations -- such as Seaford and Freeport -- took on water during the height of the storm.\nThe water has receded, she said, but there will be some restoration required in the stations that were inundated by water.\nLate Wednesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the Department of Financial Services' mobile command center would be in Islip to provide insurance assistance to homeowners, renters, and businesses affected by the flooding. It will be at the Islip Town Hall parking lot, 401 Main St., from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday. The department's disaster hotline phone number is 800-339-1759.\nThe 13.57 inches was recorded at Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma and set a state record for precipitation in a 24-hour period, the weather service said.\nAccording to a preliminary report, that amount breaks the previous mark of 11.6 inches recorded on Aug. 27-28, 2011, in Tannersville, during what the service referred to as Hurricane/Tropical Storm Irene.\nAlso reporting double-digit rainfall in Suffolk County locations were a weather service employee and trained spotters, with 12.57 inches recorded in Holbrook; 11.50 in West Islip; 11.35 in Bay Shore. Nassau saw 7.84 inches in Wantagh, 6.81 inches in Merrick, 5.30 in Lido Beach.\nThe one death that authorities said was weather-related was a fatal crash, on the westbound LIE in Melville, which occurred just before 5 a.m., during the height of the rainstorm.\nThe rain wreaked havoc on the Wednesday morning commute. Nearly every major roadway in both counties reported full to partial closures because of flooding as early as 4:30 a.m. Wednesday and until past noon, according to the state Department of Transportation.\nLocal roads were underwater as well. Suffolk County Sixth Precinct Police officers rescued an elderly man who became stranded in a flooded road in Coram Wednesday morning.\n\"Officers Thomas Wilson and Matthew Detleff were on northbound North Ocean Avenue conducting traffic control and diverting motorists due to extreme flooding, when a motorist apparently became disoriented\" due to the road closure, a release said.\nAnthony Monticciolo, 86, of Centereach, drove his 2008 Subaru into the flooded roadway \"and his vehicle immediately became disabled\" in waters 6 feet deep, which began seeping into his car.\nThe officers waded into the flooded roadway and swam to the victim's car, removing him and bringing him to safety, police said. He was uninjured, police said.\nA PSEG Long Island spokesman said the utility considers the majority of Wednesday's outages to be weather-related. From midnight to 7:05 p.m. Wednesday there were 13,077 outages, and of those, 12,549 customers have had their power restored. As of 11 p.m., the remaining number of customers without power was down to 477.\nThe rains caused massive flooding in some residential neighborhoods.\nThomas Hall of Ocean Avenue in Massapequa woke up Wednesday morning to a flooded lawn.\n\"I opened the curtains and saw the backyard was like a lake,\" said Hall, 50, a retired correction officer.\nHe estimated the water had been about a foot and a half deep but a pump was working to drain off a low-lying portion of his yard Wednesday afternoon.\nThe storm flooded roads and basements in Rocky Point, Selden and Farmingville, and the lobby of Brookhaven Town Hall was closed for three hours because of flooding, Town Supervisor Edward P. Romaine said.\nRomaine said he drove around town Wednesday morning observing \"one flooding disaster after another\" in northern and central sections of town. He estimated damage would be at least $1 million to $2 million.\nThe heavy rainfall also had an impact on water quality at local beaches, affecting bathing and shellfish harvesting.\nLate Wednesday afternoon, the Suffolk County Health Department issued an advisory against bathing at 66 beaches until 7 p.m. Thursday as sampling is conducted because of the potential for elevated bacteria levels.\nThe Department of Environmental Conservation also closed shellfish harvesting in most towns in Nassau and Suffolk counties until officials determine hazardous conditions no longer exist.\nWith John Valenti, Gary Dymski, David M.

Preliminary numbers show record precipitation figures in the state, with a total of 13.26 inches in Islip over the course of 24 hours. Tuesday and Wednesday's rainfall broke Tannersville, New York's previous record of 11.6 inches in 2011's tropical storm Irene.An entire summer's worth of rain fell in the area overnight, with flash flooding trapping cars and shutting down roads. \"Unfortunately, we've had to use that term, 'historic', to describe the natural disasters that we have faced over the last couple of years,\" Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said. Officials also reported the death of a motorist during the storm, saying the driver was hit by a tractor trailer on the Long Island Expressway.Follow @ABCNewsRadio Copyright 2014 ABC News Radio\n\n\n  Related Content Local News (new York) First Gay Group to March in St. Patrick's Day ParadeMan Arrested After Firing Shots into Brookyn HomeMan Shot and Killed in Brooklyn DeliWoman Driving Child Charged with DWI \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSweetJack Deal of the Dayloading...Get Our Free AppsFacebookTwitterTweets by @77WABCradio \n\n\n \n\n\n  Station Information  Employment Opportunities    Privacy Policy         Terms of Service      Contest Rules         Advertise With Us    Copyright  Cumulus Media   Cumulus Media is an equal opportunity employer / AA     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"],

Thirteen inches is more rainfall than Islip would see during all three summer months combined.\nMorning commute on #LongIsland this morning.

Cars were also stranded in front of the Bay Shore Mall on Sunrise Highway. Fire department boats were deployed to rescue stranded motorists in Nesconset, New York. At least two feet of water flooded the Bay Shore train station's parking lot, and a parking lot at Long Island MacArthur Airport.\nDramatic before and after photos of flooded backyard in West Islip, NY http://t.co/ENPFVICXTt pic.twitter.com/DCVmXq2lT7— NBC New York (@NBCNewYork) August 13, 2014\n\nEight inches of water had entered the first floor of a home in Bellmore, New York, and there was a report of eight feet of water in a basement in Holbrook.Islip picked up a whopping 9.71 inches of rain in just two hours ending at 6:56 a.m. ET, including an incredible one-hour total of 5.34 inches between 4:56 and 5:56 a.m. ET. Thanks to this deluge, Islip shattered its previous record wettest August of 13.78 inches in 1990, and is now likely to eclipse their wettest single month, 14.07 inches in October 2005.\nImpressive one-day torrential rain swath from D.C. to L.I. and southern CT. pic.twitter.com/cMQzfdu642— Jonathan Erdman (@wxjerdman) August 13, 2014\n\nThe heavy rain spread into parts of southern Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine later Wednesday. Roads were flooded with up to two feet of water around the Providence, Rhode Island metro. Underpasses were flooded in Springfield, Massachusetts, and two feet of street flooding closed a few streets in Leominster, Massachusetts.Vehicles were stranded Wednesday night in Saco, Maine. Portland, Maine tallied their fifth wettest calendar day on record Wednesday, picking up 6.43 inches of rain.This flooding was only the continuation of a long swath of heavy rain Tuesday and Tuesday night from the Nation's Capital and Baltimore into New Jersey.Tuesday, a flash flood emergency developed in Baltimore where more than 8 inches of rain fell southeast of the city. Heavy rain then spread Tuesday night and Wednesday morning into parts of southern New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut.

Thirteen inches is more rainfall than Islip would see during all three summer months combined.\nMorning commute on #LongIsland this morning.

Cars were also stranded in front of the Bay Shore Mall on Sunrise Highway. Fire department boats were deployed to rescue stranded motorists in Nesconset, New York. At least two feet of water flooded the Bay Shore train station's parking lot, and a parking lot at Long Island MacArthur Airport.\nDramatic before and after photos of flooded backyard in West Islip, NY http://t.co/ENPFVICXTt pic.twitter.com/DCVmXq2lT7— NBC New York (@NBCNewYork) August 13, 2014\n\nEight inches of water had entered the first floor of a home in Bellmore, New York, and there was a report of eight feet of water in a basement in Holbrook.Islip picked up a whopping 9.71 inches of rain in just two hours ending at 6:56 a.m. ET, including an incredible one-hour total of 5.34 inches between 4:56 and 5:56 a.m. ET. Thanks to this deluge, Islip shattered its previous record wettest August of 13.78 inches in 1990, and is now likely to eclipse their wettest single month, 14.07 inches in October 2005.\nImpressive one-day torrential rain swath from D.C. to L.I. and southern CT. pic.twitter.com/cMQzfdu642— Jonathan Erdman (@wxjerdman) August 13, 2014\n\nThe heavy rain spread into parts of southern Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine later Wednesday. Roads were flooded with up to two feet of water around the Providence, Rhode Island metro. Underpasses were flooded in Springfield, Massachusetts, and two feet of street flooding closed a few streets in Leominster, Massachusetts.Vehicles were stranded Wednesday night in Saco, Maine. Portland, Maine tallied their fifth wettest calendar day on record Wednesday, picking up 6.43 inches of rain.This flooding was only the continuation of a long swath of heavy rain Tuesday and Tuesday night from the Nation's Capital and Baltimore into New Jersey.Tuesday, a flash flood emergency developed in Baltimore where more than 8 inches of rain fell southeast of the city. Heavy rain then spread Tuesday night and Wednesday morning into parts of southern New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut.

Andrew M. Cuomo sent a letter to FEMA requesting its help, FEMA spokesman Don Caetano said.\nMore than 1,000 homes on Long Island suffered damage Wednesday and local states of emergency were declared in the towns of Islip, Brookhaven and Babylon, according to Cuomo's office. Islip Town was the hardest hit, recording 13.57 inches of rain in a 24-hour period, shattering a 2011 state record of 11.6 inches in upstate Tannersville during Hurricane Irene.\n\nLIVE: Photos and updates from social media\nMULTIMEDIA: Photos | Video\nRAIN TOTALS: See how much rain fell in your area\nSTAY UPDATED: News alerts, newsletters | Twitter | Facebook\n\nInspectors were dispatched Monday from Islip Town to affected areas, Councilman Steven J. Flotteron said at a news conference Monday. He urged residents to admit town inspectors into their homes to help tally damage that will go toward the assessments.\nFEMA will launch its inspectors midweek, Caetano said, and will be looking at a number of factors -- including the number of homes damaged, the number of homes with and without insurance and the dollar amount of damages -- to decide if a disaster declaration can be made and federal financial aid dispersed, Caetano said.\nFlotteron said the town expects to meet the threshold to receive FEMA help for damage to municipal properties, with nearly $20 million already calculated from the impact to public areas including both town hall buildings, marinas, parks, Long Island MacArthur Airport, train stations and roughly 20 sinkholes on roadways.\nTown officials are also pushing the inspections because of potential safety risks, such as fire hazards with water touching electrical systems or black mold forming in wet drywall if it is not removed.\nMany damaged homes were not on the waterfront and did not have flood insurance, officials said. For instance, West Islip homeowner Tom Dwyer, 46, a banker, saw his home on Driftwood Drive inundated with 5 inches of water on the ground level, damaging the electrical system, boiler and parts of the living room, kitchen and family room.\nHe, like many others throughout the town, was still in cleanup mode Monday, as he waited for an insurance adjuster after putting piles of black garbage bags filled with wet belongings out on the curb.\n\"I'm afraid to think how expensive it'll be, especially if we don't have insurance to cover it,\" Dwyer said.\n\"After two hurricanes, we were fine, but this storm did a number on us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd comment\n\n\n\n\nPlease log in to comment.

Long Island was hit particularly hard, with MacArthur Airport in Islip reporting more than 13 inches of rain between midnight and 8 a.m. That's more than the area usually sees during the entire summer months.Newscopter 7 was over the scene Wednesday afternoon in Islip, where heavy waters remained:  Town of Islip Supervisor Tom Croci signed an official State of Emergency, allowing the town to obtain crucial goods and services in an expedited manner in order to continue the recovery process. Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone also declared a state of emergency for the county as a whole as of 8 a.m., calling the weather event \"unprecedented and unpredicted.\"A total of 13.26 inches of rain fell at the airport, with 13.20 inches after midnight. The monthly all-time record is 14.07 inches in October 2005. The New York state record for 24-hour rainfall was broken Tuesday night. The previous record was 11.5 inches in Tannerville, N.Y., during Tropical Storm Irene.  On the service road to the Sunrise Highway, the high water came up so fast; some drivers didn't have time to slow down as they cruised right through it. When the pavement dried, the carcasses of stalled out cars still littered the roadway. But many roads were still flooded, some people in boats were rowing down streets to rescue people trapped in their homes. Cars stuck in the water were lost, probably forever. Workers tried to fill a sinkhole up with gravel, but the hole just kept swallowing the gravel and the workers gave up. Side streets too were flooded, and as people tried to get home, the water was still too high hours after the rain stopped. The water was so strong; it ripped through a bulkhead in Islip and swept some of the blacktop from the parking lot with it. In Bay Shore, it was hard to decide where to begin the cleanup at Saint Peter's by the Sea Episcopal Church.Flooding reached just over the foot throughout the church and school, also leaving several feet of in vital sections of this six-acre complex.\"We were up over the top of the boiler and I don't want to go in any further than this because I'm on the top step here,\" said Phil Jacobs, a parishioner, \"The National Weather Center gave the warning about flash floods and the heavens opened up and in a matter of three hours we had a foot of rain.\"Church leaders and parishioners say it happened overnight.No one knew just how bad it was until a staff member opened up the building around 7 Wednesday morning.\"What you're seeing is a disaster done by that so-called little rain storm we had last night, and it inundated our boiler room and in our church, it's about eight inches,\" said Sal Basile, a senior warden.The church doesn't have flood insurance because leaders say it's simply too much money, a $300,000 premium because they're so close to the ocean.Rather than get upset about the loss, members kept the mood light hearted believing God will yet again provide.\"We give thanks, people who give so faithfully. We welcome that. A lot of people continue to do good things. In the midst of tragedy there's always, it brings out the best in human qualities,\" a bishop said.At least five abandoned cars were submerged under feet of water on the Northern State Parkway near the exit for Oyster Bay. There was so much water that it resembled a lake. There were no reports of any injuries. Meanwhile, huge swaths of the Southern State Parkway were shut down, particularly at Exit 37, which was littered with dozens of abandoned and flooded-out cars.                                   Some residents were taking their belongings out of their ruined cars, while the Grassullo family lost five cars parked outside their house.\"We heard the alarms going off on the car and we were like, what is going on, and all the cars were submerged,\" said Michael Grassullo, a North Babylon resident. \"I come outside and I have a boat instead of a car. It's crazy.\" Viewer Jim Staubitser sent in this dramatic video of flooding in North Babylon:  MacArthur Airport remained open, but flights were delayed. Travelers should call airline carriers directly for details, or visit MacArthurAirport.com. Town of Islip Supervisor Tom Croci advised residents not to drive and to avoid flooding and road closures. DOT crews shut down the highway and blocked off the ramps in the affected areas.Several exit ramps on the Long Island Expressway were also shut down, and fire crews with boats rescued some drivers in Nesconset. The side of the parkway basically became a parking lot as drivers ditched their cars when the water rose.\"It was not organized at all,\" Islip Terrace resident James Piano said. \"There are a bunch of cars down there that floated down to the side. They didn't drive there, I can tell you that.\"  Nick Felix, of Bay Shore, had been sitting in his car since 4:30 a.m. waiting to be towed. \"I got stuck,\" he said. \"I had to push the car over to here on my own. The water came into the car. I opened the door. I made a big mistake by opening the door.\"In Brentwood on Commack Road, motorists had to be rescued from their cars. Kassandra Ade, of Brentwood, said she was pulled from her water-logged car. \"Two Good Samaritans stopped ... and I wanna thank them,\" she said. \"I don't know who they are.\"Red Cross volunteers assisted 50 motorists who were rescued from their cars on the Southern State Parkway. Red Cross teams also have distributed Red Cross flood clean-up kits in impacted areas.A fatal crash was reported on the LIE east of Exit 49 in Melville, when a car crashed into a semi trailer just before 5 a.m. shuttering the highway.  The driver of a Jeep Liberty swerved, likely due to the weather conditions, struck a tanker truck and then crashed into the guardrail, with the vehicle bursting into flames.  The driver of the Jeep was killed. The westbound LIE was closed for nearly eight hours for the investigation.  Other closures included Sunrise Highway and County Route 83 near Old Town Road.  Drivers took as much of a hit from the tremendous deluge as did nervous homeowners in neighborhoods along the South Shore. \"When this sewer system is overwhelmed, and of course heavy rains make it much worse, the plant can't handle the volume and this is raw sewage,\" said homeowner John Davis.The Long Island Rail Road was advising evening commuters to expect some cancellations and minor delays during the rush hour due to lingering weather-related issues. Service has been restored in both directions between Kings Park and Port Jefferson for rush hour, but there will be some delays. In Suffolk County, officials are advising against swimming at 66 beaches. Click here for a list of beaches.  Accumulating water was a big problem in Deal, N.J., where roughly two dozen drivers had to be rescued after their vehicles got stuck in more than 2 1/2 feet of standing water. At one point, Public Works was using a front loader to clear water from those roadways. \"It's about 2 feet deep, 3 feet at the center of the road, so it's bad,\" Public Works worker Stephen Siciliano said. \"Everything is flooded, cars stranded, people stranded. Lot of tow truck action going on out there. And my best advice is to stay home.\"  The water began to recede by early Wednesday, but cars remained partially under water.Utility crews rushed to remove a large tree that fell on a home on Spring Street in Union overnight, and looking at the size of the 20-foot tall tree, it's amazing the home did not suffer more significant damage. The residents were inside sleeping when they felt a loud rumble or a thump. They came downstairs and realized two things -- there was a tree partially inside the home that had broken through the glass, and the majority of the tree was on top of the roof. \"There are three windows in the bedroom, so I saw the branch, the tree, the green leaves through the window when I turned on the lights,\" the homeowner said. \"Then I panicked, I guess, and we came downstairs and came outside and saw the tree got uprooted.\"Luckily, the only real damage was a broken window and a dented gutter. Crews were able to get the tree off the home in about an hour.By midday, at high tide, the water breached the bulkheads on Montauk Highway, and nearby a large sink hole opened up. \"You can probably get 30 people inside of it ... so it's pretty bad,\" he said.Meteorologist Jeff Smith reports on why the rain was so heavy in Islip:  At the peak of the storm, nearly 10,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in the Garden State, most in Monmouth and Morris counties. Buses honored tickets for North Jersey Coast Line passengers because flooding in the Bay Head Rail Yard made it difficult for crews to access the trains. In New York City, the ramps from the Grand Central Parkway to the Jackie Robinson were shut down in anticipation of the heavy rain. It is back open, but standing water made it tough for drivers.Cars were slowing down considerably, but before dawn, many drivers didn't see the extent of the flooding and sloshed through at high speeds.  Thanks to construction, the water was even deeper by the sidewalk where pedestrians had to walk.Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is traveling in Israel, was briefed early Wednesday morning, said Larry Schwartz, secretary to the governor. Schwartz said he's fully aware of the problems caused by the rain and that the affected counties will receive everything they need.  One of the hardest hit areas was Millville in southern New Jersey, where unofficial National Weather Service observations show nearly 9 inches of rain. More than 7 inches in Stafford, more than 5 at Atlantic City airport and more than 4 in Tabernacle.  Several homes were evacuated along Rhonda Drive in Millville because of flooding. Relatives tell the South Jersey Times a woman sustained broken ribs and a punctured lung when the walls of her basement collapsed due to flooding.
