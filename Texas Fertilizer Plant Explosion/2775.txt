DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2013-- 
  Powers Taylor is investigating the cause of the fertilizer plant explosion that occurred on April 17, 2013 in West, Texas. Initial reports indicate that the damage surrounding the West Fertilizer Plant has been severe. This type of industrial accident is usually attributable to negligence on the part of plant workers or the failure to comply with safety procedures. If such negligence occurred, persons who have been injured or who have suffered property damage will have legal claims against West Fertilizer Company or against contractors or suppliers who contributed to causing the accident. 

  Persons injured by the explosion in West face many difficult problems. Of utmost concern is the need for immediate medical care. Persons injured by the explosion should contact emergency medical care providers immediately. If the injured parties do not have medical insurance and cannot afford medical care, one possible way to obtain medical care is to contact a personal injury law firm. State Bar rules allow personal injury law firms to advance the costs of medical care until a settlement can be reached, but firms cannot offer such advances before they are actually employed. Because Powers Taylor has included this information in this release, we cannot advance medical costs to victims of the West Fertilizer explosion. If you need a law firm that can advance medical costs, Powers Taylor can recommend a reputable firm who might consider such advances. 

  Another pressing concern for victims will be finding housing or transportation if their property has been damaged. Victims should contact their insurance agents if they have coverage. If not, the Red Cross or other charitable organizations may be available to provide temporary assistance. Contact the Heart of Texas Area Red Cross at 254-523-4985. If you are in need of additional assistance to provide basic living expenses, Texas State Bar rules allow personal injury attorneys to advance such costs to clients, but, as with medical expenses, firms cannot offer such advances in order to solicit clients. Because Powers Taylor is providing this information to prospective clients, we cannot advance living expenses to victims of the West Fertilizer explosion. If you need a law firm that can advance expenses, Powers Taylor can recommend a reputable firm that might consider such advances. 

  Once victims of the West explosion have obtained needed medical treatment and assistance with living expenses, they should seek legal counsel to ensure that they obtain compensation for their injuries. Seeking legal counsel at the earliest possible time will ensure that the personal injury attorney can properly document losses and be at the forefront of the investigation into the causes of the explosion. Making statements to insurance adjusters, without the advice and counsel of a personal injury attorney, can jeopardize the victim's ability to recover full compensation. 

  If you need information regarding the West Fertilizer explosion, authorities have created a hot line for this catastrophe: 254-202-1100. You can also contact Powers Taylor at 877-728-9607.
