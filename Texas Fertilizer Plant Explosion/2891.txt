For example, Baylor was founded in 1845.

permalinksave[+]dabbsy54 1 point2 points3 points 12 hours ago  (0 children)[–]dabbsy54 1 point2 points3 points 12 hours agoNope. Baylor and Southwestern were way earlier. TCU has you beat too by a bit, as the Add-Ran Normal College in 1873

permalinksave[+]nonnativetexan 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (3 children)[–]nonnativetexan 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoMy understanding is that Southwestern University in Georgetown is in fact the oldest institution of higher learning in the state.

permalinksave[+]pancakes09 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]pancakes09 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoProbably, I do know Baylor is the oldest continuously operating university in the state. 

permalinksaveparent[+]NoImpulseControl[S] -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]NoImpulseControl[S] -3 points-2 points-1 points 1 day agoI'm very willing to be wrong on a lot of things.
I'm okay with this one, too, but the AM site would have to admit to being wrong with me. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Schoffleine 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Schoffleine 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours agoWell the site may be wrong but as long as I've been here I've heard it as 'first public college'

permalinksaveparent[+]lefedorahat 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (3 children)[–]lefedorahat 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago...and in 1883 it got its first REAL world-class university in Austin, Texas.

permalinksave[+]NuclearWookie 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]NuclearWookie 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoIt only took seven years for people that weren't interested in sex with farm animals to demand their own public university. 

permalinksaveparent[+]capital_silverspoon 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago  (0 children)[–]capital_silverspoon 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours agoActually, when UT-Austin was established the original bill had the system annexing Texas A&M as a subordinate college. The moar you know.
Keep the Aggie jokes comin' though, nobody loves a good Aggie joke more than an Aggie.
