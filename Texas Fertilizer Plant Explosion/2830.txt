Prices start at .25/cubic cm. And you request custom quotes. Local 3D printing will definitely be a less expensive option.

Can we narrow down what we want to retweet? Like, i don't want to retweet health and beauty products on my 3D printing Twitter page. That doesnt make sense.

Any feedback very appreciated.  by  nomosoloin  Entrepreneur[+]djbr22 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]djbr22 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI've worked for Best Buy and Geek Squad - they now do this for free. My position was a "Technology Education Agent". Many Best Buys have whats called a "Solution Central" where you walk in or make appointments on doing just that, learning technology.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (368)3D printing in Tulsa!  by  [deleted]in  tulsa[+]djbr22 0 points1 point2 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]djbr22 0 points1 point2 points 4 days agoIt's similar, but we've taken input over the last year from members about how we can improve our service. We've added a filter by "industrial" quality - for all of those rapid prototyping businesses with commercial grade printers. It sets them apart from "high" quality ones like the Makerbot Replicator 2. We've also added a 'Turnaround Time' section, so you have an idea of how quickly your print can be finished.
We were able to calculate exact prices right on the list of queried search results. So let's let's say 10 results for Raleigh populate, on Makexyz you would have to upload your STL to each Printer in order to find out the price. Now, regardless of what the Printer sets as his default print price, you can see all 10 printers prices calculated on the same page.
And also, with a name like 3D Pinpoint, we are able to expand into a whole spectrum of new ideas/services. Future implementations will hopefully include "Find a filament reseller", "Find a Designer(for editing/ resizing designs), "Find a 3D scanner" etc.
We also don't charge a whopping 15% service fee.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (10)3D printing in Boise!  by  [deleted]in  Boise[+]djbr22 -1 points0 points1 point 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]djbr22 -1 points0 points1 point 4 days agoI think it's possible businesses like Kinko's may end up with them in the future. But, desktop 3D printers will also evolve. It'll go from filaments, to powder, to materials, and everything will slowly drop price over time. Which will continue to intrigue customers. I consider 3D modeler's artists in their own way, much like painters or photographers. They are expressing their ideas, and then are able to make physical, tangible objects to express their talents and interests. If you get the chance, check out Whiteclouds. They're 3D printing objects are incredible. https://www.facebook.com/whiteclouds?hc_location=stream This is one company with only a handful of members. And if they can spread their talent with others in their community, I think that's awesome. Which is part of the reason I am starting this now, because I can see the growth curve and interest of 3D printing and similar business models that were successful(you had mentioned Airbnb - but also Craigslist works very similarly) 
I haven't heard of the roller coaster one yet - very neat idea!
