It takes time, but you'll forgive yourself for those mistakes.  Don't let it be too late man.  You're only in your 20's once.
My wife and our band are moving to a bigger city to really pursue the band thing.  I'm in my mid 20's and they're all in their lower 20's.  I envy them.  I wanted the traditional go to work, have a family, buy a car, retire , blah blah blah lifestyle.
My wife opened my eyes.  Now we are pursuing our dream, and if we end up eating Raman noodles every night for the next three years, at least we get to play music and enjoy the ride!  I can get a "career" job later in life.  You only get one life, there's no point in being like everyone else, be unique, have fun, and when you are on your deathbed you won't have regrets!
Good luck man!  It's time to start now!

Why not try working towards that life then?  Really do some research on it, and im sure it's within grasp if you really set your mind too it.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (449)50 'hand-picked' Christians trained to convince churches to re-interpret scripture's gay boundaries.  by  relevantlifein  Christianity[+]TwistedDrum5 1 point2 points3 points 14 hours ago  (0 children)[–]TwistedDrum5 1 point2 points3 points 14 hours agoYou are under the basis that homosexuality is not a sin, so this conversation can not work.
Obviously, if homosexuality is not a sin, then the church is handling it in a completely wrong way, and no one would argue and say that they are handling it the right way.
If you are under the assumption that it is a sin, then it needs to be treated like any other sin out there.  The way Christians need to treat sin is talking about it, and confronting other people who are claiming to be Christian, yet are ok with that sin in their life.  Obviously in a specific way, you don't just run up to someone and start yelling at them.
But if I had a friend who told me about how drunk he got last night, and how he slept with this hott chick, I would let him know that I don't agree with that, and that if he claims to be a Christian he should really stop doing those things.
If I had a friend tell me the same thing, except it was with another guy, I would tell him the same thing.
Do you see what I am trying to say?
A sin is still a sin, even if the person believes it's not a sin.  If they are claiming to be a Christian, then they need to be treated as such.

As a Christian to another Christian how do you approach that?  They openly have nude pictures of women on their phone, in their house, and it's not art to them, they enjoy lusting after them, masturbating 3+ times a day, and they see no harm in it. How so you show them "love"?

Being honest with your brothers and sisters in Christ.
If someone said they were a Christian, but looking at porn brought them true happiness and joy (which is called deception) the church would still preach on the fact that pornography is a sin, and Christians would still talk about it.
I agree that it is not my place to talk to people I don't know about their sins, but if someone asks I will tell them the truth, and a preachers job is to teach his congregation the truth.
Homosexuals are also losing control of themselves, they just don't see it that way.  They are giving in to their sin, and just because they believe it makes them "happy" does not make it ok.
Now, if you don't believe it's a sin, then we have a difference of opinion, and that's fine.  But don't get mad at me, or say I'm being unloving, when I tell you that I believe it's a sin.

If someone believed that premarital sex wasn't a sin, and they considered themselves a Christian, I would treat them the same way.

If they are claiming to be a Christian then they need to be held to a certain standard.  I won't judge them, per se, but I will not agree with sinful lifestyles.  And I will challenge them, in the correct context, to live better lives.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (112)What is the best dream you ever had?  by  FrancoGagin  AskReddit[+]TwistedDrum5 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]TwistedDrum5 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI had a dream that I was trying to find my SO at the time, and I was running through this school and couldn't find her.  I ended up stopping by the teachers lounge to rest and had a conversation with some people.
The conversation got deep.  To a point that I was explaining to them that I was in a dream.  They were arguing with me, visibly hurt that I was telling them that they weren't real.  They told me they had emotions, they had families, they had lives, and that they couldn't be made up.  They were convincing me that I wasn't dreaming.  "If they could feel like me, how could they only exist in my dream?" I thought... Then I woke up.
This dream has stuck with me the longest, and is the only dream that really shook me when I woke up.  I was with my SO at the time and questioned everything around me, and my own existence for half of the day.

All sin needs to be overcome, and eventually disappear, or at least try to get rid of it.
What would you say to a brother who admits to having a porn addicting but says he can't stop, so he looks at it everyday?
What about someone who struggles with anger?  They tell you that they are just an angry person, lose control, and cuss people out a lot.  But that's just who they are.
Would you not encourage people to change their lifestyle of sin?
I've never been to a church that is ok with people sinning.
I understand that the mainstream thing right now is really focussing in homosexuality, and so you might get the wrong impression that this is the only sin that the church cares about, but I disagree.
I've been to more church services that condemned pornography than I have that condemned homosexuality.

I agree with you for the most part.  The reason I ask is because I am a part of a church plant and we have discussed the issue of showing love towards sinners, yet still condemning the sin.
Churches aren't there to make you feel better about your sins, they are there to help you overcome them.
What can the church do differently to accomplish this?
(I understand that you may not have an answer to my questions because it sounds like you don't believe it's a sin.  But if you do have any answers or ideas it would be greatly appreciated.)

Or are you commenting on the fact that majority of churches seem to be more accepting towards other sins, and not homosexual sin?

Granted there are perfectly good reasons for wanting to have a child biologically.  Child birth for women being the number 1.  And I think we all are curious what a kid with our SO would look like.
But it still seems selfish.
