Rules

No politics. Political videos (including ones related to current political figures) should be submitted to r/politics, r/worldpolitics, etc.
No personal information such as names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this a warning.
No witch-hunting or incitement to witch hunt. This means no demanding "Reddit justice" in any way in post titles or comments.
No police brutality/violence videos. Consider posting to a different subreddit, like /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut or elsewhere.
No blogspam or URL shorteners. Please post direct links.
No porn or gore. There are many other subreddits for such content.
No DAE posts or solicitation of votes or views.

If your submission does not appear in the new queue, please contact us (be sure to include a link to the Reddit post (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.
Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly!

permalinksaveparent[+]Team_Braniel 98 points99 points100 points 5 months ago* (1 child)[–]Team_Braniel 98 points99 points100 points 5 months ago*That is the  sound of a truly scared little boy girl.
Not an upset or sad or wanting attention, but truly honestly scared.

permalinksaveparent[+]THE_CHOPPA 18 points19 points20 points 5 months ago* (2 children)[–]THE_CHOPPA 18 points19 points20 points 5 months ago*I was in a bad car accident at about age 8 ,  i can't remember anything but hysterical pleading and repeating.." can we please go home, mom lets go home"
It heart wrenching to hear that poor girl cry like that knowing that terror she must be feeling yet  her father and her can't even hear each other!!!! god i hope they're okay

permalinksaveparent[+]Frigidus_Appellatio 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Frigidus_Appellatio 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agosimilar situation, wanted water very bad and begging for it promising to be good, clean room, etc
But since most of the bones in my face were broken and i was on my way to surgery they wouldn't let me have any so my stomach stayed empty. All they would do was flush broken teeth and blood out of my mouth, but it was the back of my throat that needed the moisture.
Anyway the point is, when your a kid in a situation like that you suddenly remember all kinds of manners you don't normally use. First hand experience.
