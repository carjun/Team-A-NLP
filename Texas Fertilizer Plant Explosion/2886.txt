But, if you read the article you'll see he was going to update his numbers and he did.  According to his professional analysis, one that I agree with, Davis is not a centrist, but a liberal.  The professor who did the study is Mark P. Jones, Chair of the Political Science Department at Rice University.

His aspirations for the highest office in the state has been years in the making accumulating a war chest of over $20 million.  
Abbott has spent the last 4 years setting up his campaign machine for governor.  And it is a well funded, managed and tested political machine.  Wendy Davis is a Johnny come lately who has only managed to raise a paltry $1 million.  She has to, at the very minimum, raise twice as much money as Abbott to have a realistic chance of overcoming the red state advantage Abbott currently enjoys.  That is the political reality Wendy Davis faces.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (168)Wendy Davis is officially running for Governor  by  libsysguyin  texas[+]MaxTheLiberalSlayer 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours ago  (0 children)[–]MaxTheLiberalSlayer 0 points1 point2 points 17 hours agoI know this will sound very silly, but Texas Senators tend not to vote against each others bills.  Call it courtesy. To the general public I know that seems very strange.  
The real fight is when the motion to suspend the rules takes place to get past the "blocker bill".  With a blocker bill at the top of the regular order of business, at least two-thirds of the senators present must vote to begin debating a measure before it can come to the floor.  Bills that do not enjoy substantial support cannot make it past the blocker bill.  So since the real fight takes place on suspension of the rules and once that is done a bills passage is almost guaranteed.

I love how the article says Davis has some history on her side as if they're trying to portray almost twenty years of losing as a good thing.
The Texas Democratic Party is a joke.

The last candidate for Governor, Bill White, former Mayor of Houston got about that much.  
Like I said before, the D's in Texas have not won a statewide seat since 1994.  That's beyond pathetic.
