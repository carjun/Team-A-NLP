A deadly explosion at a West fertilizer facility highlights the hidden risks that accompany modern life.Pipelines carrying flammable fuels run beneath our homes.Tractor-trailers hauling hazardous chemicals share our highways. And the fertilizer necessary to feed the world happens to be highly explosive. While accidents may be rare, they are very often deadly, as evidenced in West.The cause of the fire in the small Central Texas town is uncertain. But critics say this much is clear: Such operations require more oversight because of the potential for catastrophe.“There is a small chance something can happen, but when it does, it's a horrendous event,” said Elena Craft, a Texas-based health scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund. “That is why there should be more oversight.”On Friday, Donald Adair, owner of West Fertilizer Co., said in a statement that he will make employees available to investigators and “will assist in the fact finding to whatever degree possible.“We pledge to do everything we can to understand what happened to ensure nothing like this ever happens again in any community,” Adair said.U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who toured the blast site Friday, said it was too early to say whether there would be additional oversight or that it is warranted. But Cornyn said he believed the issue would be looked at as part of the investigation into the explosion. The blast in West was the first deadly explosion at a U.S. fertilizer facility in recent memory. The last major one occurred in 1994 at a production plant near Sioux City, Iowa.Federal regulators blamed “a lack of safe operating procedures” for the explosion, which killed four people and injured 18 others. Terra Industries Inc., the plant's owner and operator, in turn, blamed a defective piece of equipment.In 2001, a blast killed 30 people at a plant in France that stored about 300 tons of ammonium nitrate. Investigators have said the explosion likely was caused by the accidental mixing of the fertilizer and a chloride.Unlike the accidents in Iowa and France, which occurred at production plants, West Fertilizer Co. is a retail facility that sells directly to local farmers.Regulators consider such facilities as minor sources of air pollution, unlike coal-fired power plants and oil refineries, and thus not subject to routine inspections. The West facility, for instance, opened in 1962 but not did not obtain a permit until 2006, after a neighbor complained of a strong ammonia odor. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and federal inspectors did not visit the facility again before the blast.“The agency calls it a permit, but it is basically a registration,” said Neil Carman, a former state environmental inspector who now works for the Sierra Club. “There is no scrutiny at all, and there should be because of the disaster potential.”West Fertilizer is required to report its hazardous chemicals to health and emergency officials. Last year, it stored up to 270 tons of ammonium nitrate on the property. That was the first mention of ammonium nitrate at the site in at least six years.The company also reported storing about 100,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a pressurized liquid that becomes a toxic gas when exposed to the atmosphere. The exact amount of fertilizers and other hazardous chemicals at the facility at the time of the blast is not clear.Anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used fertilizer, and most experts agree it probably could not have been the cause of the very intense explosions Wednesday.“The anhydrous ammonia was not likely the source of the explosion,” said Harold Van Es, a fertilizer expert at Cornell University.This liquid ammonia can cause serious breathing hazards, but generally it is a non-flammable compound, scientists say.Such a large explosion was probably due to the presence of a large amount of solid fertilizer, such as ammonium nitrate, Guido Verbeck, a chemist at the University of North Texas.It is in compounds such as these that there is both a fuel, nitrogen, and an oxygen source.Ammonium nitrate is generally safe for use because it requires a very high temperature to detonate, about 3,000 degrees.“That's hotter than a house fire,” Verbeck said.Adding gasoline to ammonium nitrate, however, substantially lowers the detonation temperature such that a spark can set it off.When that happens, the solid fertilizer becomes a gas almost instantaneously. As the ammonia and nitrate molecules break apart they release a large amount of oxygen. This pressure wave creates an explosion and can, in turn, lead to the explosion of more nearby fertilizer.Express-News Staff Writer John Tedesco contributed to this report.
