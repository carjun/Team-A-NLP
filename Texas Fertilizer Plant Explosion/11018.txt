You never want to breathe the smoke from any structure fire, think of all the plastics, cleaning agents, etc. that go up in  a house fire, now multiply that times 1000 and add in some fossil fuels and other miscellany for an industrial scene.
Also Here's the MSDS for AN fertilizer (I'm assuming that's what they were making) it a known respiratory irritant.

I think you are overexaggerating, bub.  Nevermind the fact that winds are blowing Northwest at 22MPH and during severe storms to "regular" rainfall.
It's unlikely to reach us (near Cowboys Stadium), damn near impossible to hit Plano.  Are you with FOX News?

Give it a look and let me know how it compares with your observations on the ground. Note that you need to convert from UTC to local time (use this tool if confused).
Edit: added a KMZ file at the end of the post, so you can compare the plume forecast to your location more easily.

One thing about strong winds are that they disperse and mix out plumes so that the concentration is lower.  I've had a look at the HYSPLIT model and while you may smell it, it is not going to kill you. 
Furthermore, the wind will switch to the northwest in 3-4 hours behind a strong front and the plume will head off to the east and southeast.

Especially with anhydrous ammonia, at just over 100ppm it starts causing a lot of damage.

I didn't want to call the OP a liar, but we were in a low concentration part of the plume of a few ppm last night.

However, this is still a large release, so I cannot vouch for what levels people will come into contact with.
