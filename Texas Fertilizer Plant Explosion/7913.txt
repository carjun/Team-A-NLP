He's different and not everyone is gonna like him. That's ok, but this is a discussion about his new album, not about how you listened to a different album and didn't like it.

It looked too much like a Geoffrey's cat kitten or a kitten of a smaller animal, but the caption said leopard so I trusted it. I've actually made a post about a Geoffrey's cat, though.
