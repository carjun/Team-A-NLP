What do you think should be done about it? No one is willing to pay them more than what they make right now, because their work isn't very valuable.

Meets all your specifications. There are only two brightness modes: head loose and head tight. You can keep it on whatever setting you like. The brightness of each position is re-programmable, but you're never going to trigger it accidentally.
Will also accept those AA-sized Li+ batteries, and with a different body tube will accept CR123.

There have been a number of other such acts in New York. 
California's SB 140 also resulted in retroactive illegalization and confiscation.

They are pro-gun safety and regulation. No one is going into any home and taking guns.

How do you think gun regulation works?

Everything except hardware commands are portable across all platforms.
Beyond that, nano/vim/emacs over SSH is the best option.

Already stated for first point.

Which first point? And anyway, I must have missed it. Please clarify.

cv is the gap currently for most automation tasks

That is simply not true. It is one of many important areas of active research.

Less people with the same amount of money still spend less money.

I don't think you're making the connection I was driving at; (Rich) People have more money => (Rich) People buy more things => More people are needed to make stuff => More jobs
This will always be true until robots can make everything, at which point we are probably post-scarcity.

I'm talking about a decade or two from now when image recognition enables automation of advanced tasks.

Image recognition is just an infinitesimal piece of the problem of developing AIs.

A company will be able to create profit with only the investors/owners as benefactors of that profit.

And? This will increase their spending power, which means they buy more stuff.
The luddite fallacy doesn't automatically become true if development happens really fast (and by the way: development was faster during the first few industrial revolutions than it is now).
