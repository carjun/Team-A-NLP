The public ones have a bad (most likely media-inflated) reputation for being yakuza hangouts.

Most of them don't let you in if you have any tattoos as a way of combating the yakuza stigma.

In many countries, foreign companies buy land and grow crops which are transported straight out of the country, not withstanding the fact that there may be a food shortage within the country.
