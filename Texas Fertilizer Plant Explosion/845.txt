These plates are dirt cheap for the level of protection you are getting! These plates along with plate carriers can be purchased through www.steeldefender.com. If you would rather wear ceramic plates then this would be good body armor to start with. You can always add ceramic plates one at a time to this vest. Also, if you can only afford a vest with one plate from steeldefender.com then start there. You can always buy more plates later. Just remember any body armor is better than no body armor.
