I've had jobs that drained me on all levels, and others that I found extremely rewarding. Apples and oranges!

Don't feel alone. I'm with you 100%, especially with the crying!
The other day a toddler started waddling towards me in the courtyard of my apartment building. A guy I assumed to be dad said "Look! He's following you!" as if I was supposed to be pleased. 
I think I just walked away really quickly.

I thought about it, though, and decided it's more important to share a helpful resource, and if someone asks me to take it down, I will.  Sorry for any confusion!
So here's the PDF of the book.

I stand behind my assertion that FOR ME, these headphones fit these criteria.

Though I don't have a dog (yet! one day though!) I have pet rabbits. I encounter the pet version of entitled parents in the vet's office. I've had many a conversation that went like this:
Person with Dog: Oh, is that a cat in there?
Me: No, it's a rabbit.
Person with Dog: A RABBIT! Fido, let's come sniff the rabbit!
Me: No, that could be dangerous.
Person with Dog: But FIDO would NEVER hurt anything.
Me: Sorry, not taking the chance.
Ugh.

In interview situations where there's a natural place to mention it, I mention that I'm childfree. For example, if I'm asked if I can work occasional late nights or weekends, I say something like "No problem. My schedule's flexible - no kids or second job or anything..."
