(c) 2013 vintage gear demo track by RetroSound"70s Stringensemble Trilogy" 0.08 - 1.23 Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus (1979)1.24 - 2.32 Crumar Performer B (with SSM 2040 filter) (1979)2.33 - 3.53 Logan String Melody II (1979)I used the special functions (human voices, brass filter, lfo, tone colour, chorus...) and you can hear the very different sound-character of the stringmachines. I like all three a lot. bass: Moog Taurus 1 basspedal (1976)drums: Keio Minipops Junior (1972)recording: multitrack without midifx: a bit reverb and delayRetroSound home: http://www.retrosound.deFacebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/RetroSo...RetroSound blog: http://retrosound72.blogspot.de/
