For true stories that are so mind-blowingly ridiculous, that you could have sworn it was an Onion story 
Rules - hover or click here for full version







1. Do not alter headlines, copy and paste
Post articles with their original titles. Posts with altered headlines will be removed and the submitter will be asked to resubmit with the original title. -- Headlines must be copied and pasted from the article, we do not allow any alterations whatsoever as a matter of fairness. - Do not add or remove anything from the headline. Some publications have secondary headlines (aka byliner, flavor text, subheader), only use the primary headline portion.


2. Do not post duplicates
Please review the current posts avoid posting any duplicates. Articles on the same subject matter as previously submitted content will be removed.


3. Submit only if "Oniony"
Please consider /r/OffbeatNews, /r/Offbeat, /r/WTF or similar subreddits unless your article truly reads like the Onion wrote it. This is highly subjective; you are encouraged to downvote articles that shouldn't be here, and upvote those that truly read like The Onion. Moderators also have discretion to remove articles that are very unlike an Onion article.


4. No meta posts
That is, posts communicating with /r/nottheonion or specific people. The moderators may do this from time to time as needed; otherwise, please don't. If you need to suggest a meta thread, send modmail.


5. Mark NSFW stuff!
Mark NSFW stuff! Please remember that bathing suits are NSFW at many workplaces - so it's not about freedom or your workplace (lucky you!) - it's about being nice to your fellow redditors.


6. No crosspost tags
Refrain from using "crosspost" tags. Submissions containing crosspost tags will be automatically removed and you will be asked to resubmit your link. Also do not append the name of the news organization to the front or rear of the headline, just use the headline only.


7. Link to original source when possible
Always link to source articles whenever possible. If an article mostly lifts from another source that it credits please use the source article unless there is a compelling reason not to. This also means do not submit from blogs.


8. No Gawker Links
Gawker Media is not a reliable news source, and often exaggerate facts or outright make them up. Do not submit from Gawker sites, they will be automatically removed


9. No YouTube or similar
YouTube and other streaming videos are also not valid for submission.


10. English articles only
Submissions need to be in English


11. No Satire articles
Submissions cannot be from other satire sites or columns even if they are technically "Not The Onion". Also note "This and That" with CBC and "Borowitz Report" on The New Yorker are satire despite the rest of those publications not being satire


12. No Tabloid News
Articles from tabloid news sources (i.e. Sun, Mirror, Daily Mail etc) and articles that source and/or quote their news from tabloids are not permitted. Please consider posting those stories those elsewhere.


13. No Mobile versions
Please link to the regular versions of articles and not the mobile version of articles


14. Must be a news article
Submissions need to be actual articles and not videos or editorials.


15. Don't delete and repost without mod approval.
If you remove and repost a news article because you don't think it performed well, it will be removed. You and the domain may be banned. In the case that the news source changed the title, just send a message to the mods and we'll advise as to what to do.
