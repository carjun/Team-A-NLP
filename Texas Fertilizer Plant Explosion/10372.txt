 Bags: I have a high quality backpack (Case Logic) and a Travelpro Rollerboard. I never check luggage, so I want something light and tough.
Cases: My phone and my laptop are both in cases. Otter Box for my phone, and a Thule case for my laptop. I have a 3M privacy screen, but I also work on confidential docs.
Gear: iPhone and an iPad Mini. Both have the option of being a hotspot. I have Bose QCs, and a pair of in-ear headphones (Sony and/or Beats Tours). I use a 13" MacBook Pro (and I do software dev and technology consulting)
Chargers: of course, I have the cords. But I carry a USB battery pack for emergency charging of my phone. Has a USB plug for other things.
Other: I carry Airborne Chewables, a small first-aid kit, a Tide pen and a small pen looking thing which has two sizes of flathead/Phillips screwdrivers on either side. I also carry Benedryl - works for both allergies and sleeping on red eye flights. Oh, and a hand warmer packet.
Finally, I have a pair of New Balance minimas I carry. Compact and thin, but not goofy looking like the Vibram Five Fingers. 
For shorter travel (3 days or less) I carry a smaller overnight bag instead of my Travelpro. I am a roller when it comes to packing, and would rather be compact and spend 20 mins ironing than carry a bigger suitcase.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (2)Jon Stewart Shreds GOP Over Obamacare: ‘Utter Insanity,’ ‘It’s a F*cking Law!’  by  hop3lessin  politics[+]cory_foy 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]cory_foy 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoNo, it's not a racist thing. Politicians on both sides are using it as a tool. But only because news outlets are playing along. If they didn't, it would go away. 
The section you quoted was referring to the /media/ using the term, not the Republicans. I certainly don't blame them for using it - I get how political games work. But news outlets should be above that.

It wouldn't be surprising at all. And that's pretty sad.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1563)Jon Stewart Shreds GOP Over Obamacare: ‘Utter Insanity,’ ‘It’s a F*cking Law!’  by  hop3lessin  politics[+]cory_foy 129 points130 points131 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]cory_foy 129 points130 points131 points 1 day agoIf you watched the clip - every media outlet he showed - Fox, MSNBC, CNN - all were using the same talking point that it was a bipartisan showdown. Unless people take extra effort, it's easy to think this is a problem on both sides. The media - generally where people get summaries of what is going on - is not doing a good job of explaining what is really happening here. 
Look how many are using the term "Obamacare". It's not called that. But they don't want to say, "Republicans are fighting for a delay in the Affordable Care Act." But why not? It's what it is, right?

I think you'll find plenty of us here who understand just what that is like.
Out of curiosity - why Marriot over Hilton? When I first started traveling, I picked Hilton because my wife had worked for them at one point many moons ago. But I've wondered what it's like on the "other side"

The easiest way to explain it would be if someone asked about boiling an egg, and they had a problem with them cracking. But then they revealed the way they were cooking the egg was siphoning gasoline into a drip tube and feeding it directly to a pan under the cooking vessel. Oh sure, it might be heating your water now, and you might even get some eggs cooked. But the process shows such a fundamental misunderstanding of highly dangerous semantics that they need to stop what they are doing RIGHT THIS SECOND and rethink all that they know about whatever they are doing.
I know this can be frustrating to newbies. But if you are on any kind of a Unix box and aren't sure why it's bad to use sudo, or it doesn't spring immediately to your head why passing user-generated data directly to a system process would be a bad idea, you have quite a bit of reading in front of you.
For example, start here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project. For real fun, look at something like an RFC for OAuth2 security: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819. 
If you are writing public facing service, you should know security implications well.

Watches the southbound lane of Duraleigh road. 5500 block.  by  Sir_Dudein  triangle[+]cory_foy 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago  (0 children)[–]cory_foy 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoWhen we lived in Charlotte, they had a mobile speed trap. But if I remember correctly, they had to have signs approaching it warning motorists it was there. So I'm guessing you are right about it being a license plate scanner.
Might not be bad to hit up the news to see if they know anything.

That's what OP is referring to. There was a time when you could watch what was going on while they were flying.

Two flight attendents in the front, they block the aisle with a heavy cart. The pilot comes out, and one of the FAs goes into the cockpit, and they close the door. The other FA keeps the aisle blocked. When the pilot comes out, they exchange, and then they unblock the aisle. Crazy stuff.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (12452)Chaos Computer Club breaks Apple TouchID  by  chmarsin  iphone[+]cory_foy -2 points-1 points0 points 9 days ago  (0 children)[–]cory_foy -2 points-1 points0 points 9 days agoActually - iOS 7 requires a password to change settings. Now, I don't know if the fingerprint bypasses that, but if it does, I can see the following scenario:

Someone steals an iPhone
They take the fingerprint right off the screen
They use a kit like this to get a fingerprint to unlock
They can now reset the phone, and disable Find my Phone

So now we have vast amounts of people sticking their fingerprint on the device, for security theater. Doesn't seem like much could go wrong with that. Maybe the iPhone 8 will come with finger-prick technology to do a blood sample for security.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (31)Long range Wi-Fi with limited Line of Sight  by  cory_foyin  wifi[+]cory_foy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago  (0 children)[–]cory_foy[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoAs I said - the cable company wants $11k to run anything down. No fiber providers out here - in fact, only the one cable provider. Pretty rural area.
I'm aware of things like Dish Internet - in fact, we're using a Verizon 4G hotspot. But I work from home, so our usage is around 60GB per month, and that's with us being very conservative in our use.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (4)What do you do for a living that has you traveling? How often are you on the road? International or domestic?  by  WorkingISwearin  roadwarriors[+]cory_foy 1 point2 points3 points 10 days ago  (0 children)[–]cory_foy 1 point2 points3 points 10 days agoSoftware and Process Consultant. Plus I speak at conferences. I did about 160k miles in 2011, slowed down a little, still ended up elite on both Delta and Southwest. Just transferred positions where I work from home more, but ended up with the last 5 weeks being in Madison, WI, Chicago, Los Angeles, and two trips to Florida. 
Mix is mostly domestic, with some international. I've slowed down the Int'l travel because of how hard it is on the family.

But may not be a bad idea to check into it again.

I just got back from LA. The hotel the client told us to stay in was $399 a night. So the above seems like it could be realistic - especially if the congressman didn't buy their own breakfast or lunch.

You just needed a credit card.
Also, if they were flying low enough, they could have gotten a signal.

The typical MO was everyone stay calm, they fly somewhere, land, and negotiate release. 
I fly a lot, and I can tell you that if anyone tried for the cockpit door, you'd have a lot of people beating them down now.

But it won't be long before consumer versions are out.
I have two, but I'm also a developer, so it was well worth it for me.

I've had the opporuntity to have about 40 people try ours, and found that looking around is fine, but moving - especially up and down stairs - leads to motion sickness, or at least queasiness, in most people. You can get used to it, for sure. But it's amazing how immersed you feel.

Sure they have a giant pink princess tent. But they also helped us catch and clean fish for dinner last night. And I'm just as excited (as they are) to go to a reptile show or a tea party. Even simple things like my youngest saying yesterday that only girls have purses, and me reminding her that some girls carry wallets, and some guys carry purses. 
But it's really, really, really hard with everything else that surrounds them. TV shows, school mates, etc. Ultimately we can only do the best we can.

Just because your country does certain things - like find it acceptable to walk around in a bikini or no top with shorts - doesn't mean that you should automatically do that in another country.

Several programming shops do that now. I ran the arm of a Chicago company in Florida and that's how we hired - if you could code an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe, we'd hire you as an apprentice, where we'd train you (paid!) for 6-9 months. It was fantastic for people in similar situations as you,
