vintage synth demo by RetroSoundOberheim OB-X 8-Voice Analog Synthesizer from the year 1979. The OB-X was available with 4, 6 or 8 discrete voice cards.part1: some self-made classic OB-X sounds (pads, brass, bass, sync- and crossmodulation sounds and more)part2: some features of the OB-X http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyT2gX...part3: some self-made classic OB-X soundshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udwJIU...The Oberheim OB-X is one of the best analog poly-synths ever. A classic! The sound is stunning, organic and very powerful. The sound character (based of the discrete circuits and the SEM design VCF) is different to the later curtis chip based OB-Xa and OB-8. Used by: Rush (Subdivisions, Tom Sawyer), Nena (99 Luftballons, Nur Geträumt), J.-M. Jarre (Magnetic Fields), Killing Joke (Love Like Blood), Roxy Music (Avalon), Queen (Flash Gordon), Styx (Too much time on my hands), Japan, Supertramp, Suzanne Ciani, Tangerine Dream (Exit) ...more info: http://www.retrosound.de andhttp://www.myspace.com/retrosound72
