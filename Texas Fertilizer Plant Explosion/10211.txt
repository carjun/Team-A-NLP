            Lianne La Havas no longer needs any introduction; her trajectory has been well documented. Her name has become synonymous with beautiful, soulful, emotive songs about heartbreak. Aged 22, her debut album reached number 4 in the UK album charts, was nominated for this years Mercury Music Prize and she can now count Stevie Wonder, Prince, Erykah Badu, Bon Iver and Jill Scott as fans.Lianne announces the release of a two-part video with Noisey.com and Essence.com for singles "Elusive" and "Gone". Director Colin Solal Cardo (La Blogotheque) said of their partnership:"I've been collaborating with Lianne for more than a year now, but working on this project felt like something completely new. Lianne's a brilliant storyteller, there's a true cinematic quality to her songs. When you listen to them, you go through all these emotions and narratives, like a collection of short movies. We felt like it was finally time to build a world around these songs, give life to these love stories and let Lianne actually become these characters. Be it a candid young girl falling in love, or a heartbroken femme fatale in the middle of the woods. I feel fortunate for the trust relationship I have with Lianne, it's something any music video director has to cherish because it's rare and precious. Ultimately, that's what allows an ambitious project like this one to exist."Video CreditsDirecteor: Colin Solal CardoDirector of Photography: Fabien BenzaquenArt Direction / Stylism: Colin Johnco & Ylva FalkEditor: David PoucetColor Grading: Julien Hery (Royal Post)Produced by La Blogothèque: Matthieu Buchsenschutz & ChrydeBuy Lianne La Havas's album 'Is Your Love Big Enough?' here now - http://smarturl.it/Lianne_I...Follow Lianne La Havas on:Facebook - http://po.st/c0Ox9ITwitter - http://po.st/qmN9wSWebsite - http://po.st/sYlnbq
