Kinda wanted a black HTC One though....
Sounds like they should have put that "refurbished" unit or of its misery.

I believe it.... That finger on the heat sink video pretty much proves it

With my last phone I felt the heat pretty early on. I really hope it doesn't go to crap. If it does, maybe I could replace it again. Wishful thinking, I know.

I just got my HTC One replaced by AT&T..... I had the purple tint and photos are so much better now. I'd try and fix it regardless.

I don't know if why carriers don't know its an issue. Seems pretty common.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (24)Which HTC phone should I get?  by  Solus90in  htcone[+]wojx 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]wojx 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoIsn't it mostly about screen size and color at this point? I'd say figure out how big a device you want first and maybe try them out at a local store first. The standard One is a pretty good size, but some might feel it's too big. I think /r/android had some parts or links about picking a phone

(No more purple camera tint!)  by  wojxin  htcone[+]wojx[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]wojx[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoYeah. Using Helium has been kind of a drag. Restoring app data and settings isn't as easy as I thought. 
I would use a USB cord and  copy the photos and videos from the phone to a computer. That's pretty much foolproof. You may need to install the HTC drivers though. Then navigate to your media.  I've been using Dropbox and set up camera upload so whenever you're in WiFi it automatically uploads
your pictures and videos. You can get a decent amount of space in the cloud. I also used the app G cloud. They give you 1 GB, but if you do stuff such as like their page via Facebook or +1 them they give you more space. I got to like 1.7 GB I think.  I would do at least two copies of your stuff. That way if one doesn't work.... I'd say Dropbox and physically copy via USB are easiest. 
I ended up reinstalling most of my apps from the Play Store. Using Helium was kinda tough. I'd also make sure my contacts are saved on my Google account or something cuz you would lose those too. Maybe a SIM card? Come to think of it I think if you use HTC Sync
Manager on your computer you can copy your music, apps, texts, and contacts, and videos to a hard drive pretty easily. The interface is pretty straightforward. 
Let me know if you have any more questions.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)Online classes to fulfill the upper division elective requirement?  by  theorysin  csuf[+]wojx 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]wojx 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoMight help to talk to an Academic Advisor (they have walk in advising always) but you can filter your search using the GE codes. I talked to one last week and she told me to do this. Then you know the classes fulfill the requirement. Then just look for online I guess. 

You will need 6 more units of upper division GE coursework (300+ level).  Upper division GE classes can be found in GE areas B5, C3, D5, or E.
Courses from your major department cannot be used to satisfy GE requirements.  No more than three courses can be taken from one department.
