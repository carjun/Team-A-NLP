Lyrics:My mind is unwilling and your flesh is so weak,do my movements betray the secrets I think,I always stand by walls and try to humour fools,am I moving in a straight line.Oh it's unlust and the one dimensional boy,oh it's unlust and the one dimensional boy,Oh it's unlust and the one dimensional boy,oh it's unlust and the one dimensional boy.
