I touched your sweaty back as you crowdsurfed in Memphis! I have a few questions:

I know you are a very proud father. How has fatherhood impacted your music? Do you hope James follows in your footsteps?
I love the song title The Difference Between Medicine and Poison Is In the Dose. Do you have a favorite song title?
How great is Dave Davison's beard?

Thanks for doing this AMA! Come to Birmingham, AL!

Click here and fill out the form with your information.  Choose "Legislative Session 2013" from the "Email Concerning which Issue" choices.  And in the "Comments", in your own words, politely ask the governor to sign HB9, the Homebrew Bill.  Try to get as many people as you can to do this!  We know our prohibitionists opposition will be writing him, and we must vastly overwhelm their numbers!!!
