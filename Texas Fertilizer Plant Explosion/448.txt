I'm old and well remember the insane rivalry between Brian Clough and Don Revie, and even when they left the respective clubs and Mackay and Armfield took over, the clubs detested each other from top to bottom.
I'm glad those days of sheer hatred are long gone, but it's still the fixture I want us to win as much as any other (perhaps bar one).

The back-heel from Martin to set up Johnny Russell for the second was quite sublime - and as for Will Hughes's goal in the second half - wow.
Make the most of young Will, because someone is going to come in with a wheelbarrow load of cash, either in January or at the end of the season, and he will end up at a top 4 Premier League team.

True.
One is an obnoxious dictatorship, and the other one is Iran.

I'm looking forward to a player coming in who I have never heard of.

I think that's been part of the problem over the last few years. 
Mind you, back when Brian Clough was in charge and we had just been promoted to the top division in 1969, I remember going home on the bus one night and partially heard a report on the radio about a new player we had signed.
I remember being bitterly disappointed when it turned out that it wasn't Tommy Gemmell as I had first thought, but Archie Gemmill.
How wrong I was - Archie became an all-time great.

I'll not dwell on the first half where no Derby player did themselves justice (we trailed 4-1 at half time to a rampant Ipswich Town) but Whitbread played very well in the second half and we stormed back to draw 4-4.

I think the keeper must have indulged in a couple, judging by that howler which the keeper of my local pub team would have been ashamed of.

It's not like they need a note from their mum, and the club doctor could easily 'pretend' that the player is fit.

My answer was always 'Brian Clough could do both' - but that's because I'm old.

And comparisons with the actions of other players is completely irrelevant.

Nowhere near enough.
The one thing about Clough's stint in charge at Derby was that he had the evil eye over his dad's former employee and arch-enemy. Personally, I would have liked it to continue until it reached 44 wins (one for each day Brian was in charge at Elland Road) but last night's McClaren-inspired comeback does at least give me some hope for the future after Clough.
