Harper and the conservatives should stop thinking of Canadians as 'consumers.'  We are Canadians, we are taxpayers, we love the country (the way it was before Harper) and we would like to think we are intelligent after all we are voters in a democracy.But Harper and corporations don't see us for who or what we are but more for what we can be tricked into consuming.  We are little dollar signs for corporate profits.If we are good enough to pay taxes, good enough to vote then sure as hell we are good enough to know about trade deals not after they are signed but during negotiations. We should have a country wide referendum on the trade deal.  Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the deal is, "the biggest deal Canada has ever made."
