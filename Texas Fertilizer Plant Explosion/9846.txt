I got shot in the head because a cop rammed me from behind while chasing another player. They don't seem to 'bust' you... it's like Judge Dredd up in Los Santos

Cops are too fast and aggressive

When you're on a road. Hit the hills and they give up almost instantly, even the helicopters just fly off after a while.

Contrary to popular belief, it's a nice city to live in.

I don't understand this... I've lived here for 25 years and it's IMHO the best/nicest city in the world. A beautiful valley peppered with buildings and houses, amongst an endless sea of trees, with a gorgeous river highlighting the entire country's political centre.
I've been a lurker in the sub for a while now, and I'm really tired of hearing people bash this great place...
