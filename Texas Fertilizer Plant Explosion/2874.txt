(c) 2013 vintage sampler demo by RetroSoundThe Emax from the year 1986 is the follower of the Emulator II. A 12 bit sampler with analog filters (SSM 2047). The sound is vintage, organic and really cool. The next generation the Emax II has unfortunately digital filters and the sound is very different to the Emax. Depeche Mode used the Emax in the studio and at the 101 tour.more info: http://www.retrosound.de andhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/RetroSo...
