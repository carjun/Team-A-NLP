These bad names are one of the many reasons why I love college football.

The names they come up with for the "low end" bowl games are pretty awful.

C9 losing plus two big tests this week is all I need to stop watching until the finals. Good luck to EU (man y'all deserve it) and let's hope that the finals are as crazy as the C9 vs Fnatic games were!

It's just a shame our region is so bad.

Oh well. At least NA won a game.
Edit: To clarify I meant 1 game in post-group play. I personally don't count group, but y'all can feel free to change my view! I'm open to new views.

It's easier to see the screen since the UI doesn't get in the way, you can see the entire wave without having to unlock your screen (though I bet most pros play with unlocked screens), and blue, until recently, would get roughly 2 minions more xp by ten minutes due to a bug.
It's mostly the UI getting in the way and the unlocking of the screens.

C9 lost level 1.

Now that's interesting.
I feel C9's team comp isn't quite as strong as Fnatic due to Fnatic's sheer mobility. Combine teleport with Kass and it's going to be a very hard game. This will be a fun game to watch.
Go C9! Do your best!
Edit: I bet that Fnatic is going to camp Vlad. He needs to be ramped up and if he's targeted it'll hurt.

Tis life. At least they won 1 and are making Fnatic fight for it.

For example, I'm an Ohio State fan. We hate Michigan. If Michigan is beating Ohio State at the horseshoe/Ohio State's stadium the crowd is deadly silent. If Ohio State is beating the crap out of Michigan the crowd is loud as sin. It's how "home field advantage" is. I'm not surprised by this at the least.
