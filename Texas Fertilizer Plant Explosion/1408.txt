I just happened to see this one when I was driving home last night.

So much for my lunch.

Is this the same tree that the Lich is imprisoned in? If so, it's so small in this episode. When she shows Finn and Jake the Lich inside the tree later on, it's much bigger.

I never in a million years would have expected the ghost lady to be Finn in a past life.. I really thought she was going to be his mom or something. But why is there a picture of Shoko in the Sky Witch's house???

The color depends on what night you went.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (361)Just moved to Lubbock, what is there to do and how can I meet some people?  by  newtolbkin  Lubbock[+]cassiephilpot 1 point2 points3 points 23 days ago  (0 children)[–]cassiephilpot 1 point2 points3 points 23 days agoJack and Dianne's on the north side of town is fantastic. I have literally never been there and not met someone new. It's typically an older crowd during the week, but the weekends are always awesome. I also like Cujo's off of 4th street..they have great drink specials. The Blue Light has some great live music!!

permalinksavecontextfull comments (48)Mia Wasikowska has spent the last few years proving her outstanding ability to transcend deep into different characters. "Stoker" shows her taking her craft to another level.  by  [deleted]in  movies[+]cassiephilpot 14 points15 points16 points 23 days ago  (0 children)[–]cassiephilpot 14 points15 points16 points 23 days agoPersonally, I loved Stoker. I liked that I had no idea what was really going on until near the end. I thought that the trailer had given away too much, but it ended up being a bit misleading.
