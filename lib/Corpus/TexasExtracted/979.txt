                                            In the aftermath of the explosion at at fertilizer plant, residents of West, Texas, have turned to faith. Mourners attend a service Thursday night at Assumption Catholic Church.  The people who know West well say it's a little town known for many things: its Czech heritage; its kolaches, a Czech pastry that's become something of a delicacy in the region; its ability to have a good time. Karasek encouraged those attending the vigil to grieve and to allow those around them to grieve as well. If that means being angry with God, so be it. Charlie Ferguson, 75, has lived in West his entire life, and he considers himself blessed because of the people. West, he said, is typically a happy place, with hard-working people. They're resilient and will weather this, he believes. Don Cole, a Dallas-based pastor with Victim Relief Ministries, has traveled to disaster areas throughout the region to offer counsel. Beyond the trauma of what happened, Cole said, the experience stirs up difficult, existential questions that can be just as terrifying: Is there a God? Who created us? Why would God let this happen? In West, it's a the tightknit community that has, in recent days, been drawn even closer together. Most everyone falls within just a few degrees of separation from someone killed, injured, who lost their home or were evacuated from theirs. As they try to take steps toward healing, Nelson said prayer will be critical to that. Comments are filtered for language and registration is required.
