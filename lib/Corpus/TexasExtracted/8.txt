Should the Yankees be concerned? Not if he keeps pitching the way he has in his past three outings. 	Sabathia took a matter-of-fact approach with his comments as he fielded one question after another about his lack of velocity. Where most power pitchers would shy away from the inevitable loss of a few ticks on their fastball, Sabathia was practically embracing it. There was no talk about it being early in the season, a common refrain heard in most of these cases. 	Instead, Sabathia spoke like a man who has been waiting for Father Time to catch up to him. More than 2,500 innings will do that, I suppose. 	Sabathia was admittedly terrible in the first inning Wednesday, needing 31 pitches to record the first three outs against Arizona. Paul Goldschmidt belted a two-run homer on a dreadful changeup to give the Diamondbacks a quick lead, making Sabathia consider abandoning the pitch for the rest of the night. 	But Francisco Cervelli kept calling the pitch, so Sabathia kept throwing it. Seven innings and 77 pitches later, Sabathia was in the dugout watching Travis Hafner hit a pinch-homer, handing the southpaw his third straight victory.
