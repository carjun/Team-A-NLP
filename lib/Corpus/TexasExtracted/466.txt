Companies can get in lots of trouble for not paying employees for time worked.  Tell your chef you're willing to work hard and kick ass for every hour you're in the house, but you need to be paid for every hour of that time. If I'm serving barbecued pork in a serve-yourself or buffet type setting, I pull it and serve as-is, and serve sauces on the side.  You can moisten it with some of the pan drippings if you like, but it shouldn't be swimming in the drippings.  Also, pulling pork doesn't mean you need to shred it into threads; people like chunks of meat, not felt.  The only time I'd dress the pork with barbecue sauce would be if I'm serving made sandwiches. You can toast the chile seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat until golden brown, and then pulverize them in a spice grinder and use in cooking, add to dry rubs or spice mixes, etc. Some Mexican moles use toasted chile seeds as a flavor and thickening agent.  Mole negro toasts the seeds until blackened.  But that's a very complicated recipe... I think with a meatball sandwich, the ingredients need to be a little more seasoned than normal, or they taste a bit bland.  The sauce you use can be more heavily seasoned than a regular marinara. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
