											                           Report errors or inaccuracies: reader@guardian.co.uk Standing outside his family's restaurant, Nors Sausage and Burger House, shivering in the strange spring chill, Matt Nors reflected on his sister Whitney's escape. She lives with her young child only a couple of blocks from the plant. Or, lived: Nors fears that his sister's house has been wrecked. "My sister was really close to it. I haven't seen the house but supposedly it's demolished," he said. West Fertilizer Co. has not been inspected by the US federal agency that is responsible for ensuring worker safety since 1985. More from The Guardian's Matt Williams: On that occasion it identified one serious, and two other violations and imposed a fine. Since then it has not visited the factory once. A glance of the figures confirmed that to be true - the watchdog is tasked with overseeing the safety of 7 million worksites in the US. In all, it has 2,000 inspectors nationwide and under current funding levels can only conduct 40,000 inspections every year. As such, a typical workplace can be expected to get a visit every 175 years. And the agency's budget is set to cut as a result of the sequester, making it likely that even less workplaces will be inspected. As a result of automatic spending cuts, the OSHA will have its budget cut by 8.2%. "Our focus is on trying to help the families affected by this, to get them as close to normalcy as we can." He said people will be "physically scarred for years, but these are tough Texans." "The second thing is the incredible praise that must be given to the first responders across this entire community. In Texas our first responders don't run from harm, they run to help. Anyone who grew up in a small town understands that this tragedy will touch every family in West and the surrounding communities in some way. I urge all Texans and Americans to join me in keeping the people of West and our first responders in your prayers as this situation continues to unfold. While investigating the complaint, the TCEQ found that the plant had not got in place a valid permit authorizing its emission of air contaminants. Prior to 2004, the factory had not been required to have a permit, due to being constructed before state and federal requirements kicked in. Follow up inspections by the TCEQ took place, but no further complaints have been logged by the commission. Meanwhile the EPA has issued more information as to the complaint that led its fine being levied against the factory. The deficiencies found by inspectors in 2006 included a failure to update its risk management plan, a failure to document how identified hazards had been addressed and poor employee training records.But since then no problems have been reported. The factory complied with a requirement to update its risk management plan in 2011, EPA records show.

Photograph: Tony Gutierrez/AP It seems clear that there was an initial fire before the explosion occurred. So the CSB investigation will probably identify how the fire was able to get near the bulk storage tanks holding anhydrous ammonia. Bulk storage tanks are normally protected by bunds/dykes or drainage systems that deflect or prevent burning materials accumulating underneath the tank. The damage sustained indicates that a high energy explosion took place. In such events, a very high pressure wave is generated by the explosion that travels extremely rapidly through the surrounding environment resulting in catastrophic consequences over a large area. Such events usually involve large quantities of flammable vapor clouds which are constrained i.e. enclosed or confined. A BLEVE scenario as mentioned earlier would cause similar catastrophic consequences. Another possible scenario is that flammable dust was ignited, but I have heard no mention of dust in any reporting so far. Whatever the cause I fear the casualty numbers will increase. The only good news is that the event took place at night when the facility was closed, people were in bed and the adjacent school was closed. The terrorists attack in Boston and the explosion in West remind us that life is sometimes cut short; accordingly I ask all Americans to pray for these communities. I am praying and hoping for the best in the wake of the disastrous explosion in West. It is heartbreaking to hear of the fatalities and numerous injuries. I am grateful for all of the police, fire, emergency responders and volunteers from our community and around the state who have come to aid those in need. Our offices will continue to monitor the aftermath and be on hand to assist our friends and neighbors throughout the recovery process. My thoughts and prayers go out to the community of West as they endure through this difficult period. Parnell McNamara, the sheriff of McLennan county, told The Guardian that an unknown number of people were still missing, and that search and rescue teams continued to comb the shattered town. Dan Halyburton, spokesman for the American Red Cross, said the charity planned to distribute food and blankets to families forced into shelters when their homes were destroyed. Gandalovic has been ambassador since 2011 and has visited West before. A spokesman for the Czech embassy in Washington said the ambassador: "would like to support the community in their time of sadness." More from The Guardian's Tom Dart, who has been speaking with people in West, Texas throughout the day. Standing outside The Village Shoppe, broom in hand, Joyce Beaubien said that she is concerned for a friend and former neighbour who works at the plant. "I haven't been able to get in touch with her," she said. "People here are really shocked. The firefighters are all volunteers, they all live here, their families are here, it's just so devastating to people who've lived here all their lives." The retired medical secretary, who now works part-time in the store, said that new housing as the town expanded in the past two decades meant the plant was no longer isolated as it used to be. "The fertilizer plant was out in the country and they just built around it when I guess they shouldn't have," she said. Norma Talbott arrived at the store with her mother-in-law, Vi, who was in her house only a short walk from the plant when the disaster struck. Norma said she had driven from Plano, near Dallas, to look after the 83-year-old, who suffered a cut and bruising.

SMITH/EPA Maria Galvan runs a thrift store two doors down from Czech Point Collectibles and Antiques. Her shop's windows were blown out and are now boarded up. She arrived for work this morning to discover glass littering the floor and all of the ceiling's panels on the ground, she said. "It was all busted in, glass everywhere," she said. "Very very bad... I'd fixed up my window for Mother's Day, it's all messed up." Galvan said that she was shopping at a Walmart in a nearby town at the time of the explosion and saw goods tumble off the shelves. "We thought it was lightning that hit. People were running every which way," she said. Sarah Gardner, whose grandparents own an apartment complex near the plant, said that she "thinks everyone got out." She said that of 22 units housing families or individuals, up to 20 might have been occupied at the time of the explosion. Between half and 75% of residents were accounted for so far, she added. The building, however, she fears is "a total loss", little more now than a frame. Being a volunteer emergency service provider can be very fulfilling. I joined a volunteer fire company as soon as I was old enough, in 1993. I have responded to hundreds of calls for service since then. Most of them have been minor, a few have been major, but all shared the characteristic of somebody needing help and knowing that whatever the request or circumstances, the local fire department would be there to help. I still volunteer because I think that my contributions are still making a positive impact in my community, and I hope that sense continues as I get older.

Photograph: ZUMA/Rex Features Perry said he is "not comfortable" saying how many people died in the explosions until families are notified. Shivering from the cold as he stood outside the family's restaurant, Nors Sausage and Burger House, Matt Nors reflected on his sister's lucky escape. Nors lives five miles from West. "The first thing that went into my mind was a nuclear bomb," he said. "I was standing in my garage flipping meat on the grill. The shock wave felt like somebody hit me in the gut." Inside the restaurant, his father, Bernie, said that he knew four firefighters who had been killed. "They were fighting the fire when it blew up," he said. He lives four miles away, next to a field. "When it blew up you could see the shock wave hit the wheat field, boom," he said. Matt Nors said that West is "really close-knit. Real family-oriented. Something like this happens, there's no shortage of help." The Texas governor's office tweeted a photo of the state's governor, Rick Perry, attending a briefing with emergency management and state officials. The Environmental Protection Agency confirmed to the Guardian that the West Fertilizer Company was cited in 2006 for having a deficient risk management plan in 2006. None of the local news reporters seem to know the difference between ammonia and ammonium nitrate. If this had been AN, the whole town of West would be a crater. AN is a mass-detonable explosive, ammonia is a flammable, corrosive, poisonous gas. Phil Calvin, fire chief of nearby Navarro Mills Volunteer Fire Department, has told the Guardian his son Perry Calvin, was one of the first volunteers to respond to the call for assistance Wednesday evening and has been missing since just after the explosion. Perry had been taking an EMT class at the nursing home across the street from the plant when the group received the call. The remains of a fertilizer plant destroyed by an explosion in West, Texas.

Pool/AP WacoTrib.com has assembled a list of links for people affected by the explosion. These include Google docs documents for people who want to offer aid or housing to West residents, much like those created following the Boston explosions.  This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate I live in Houston but I previously lived in Austin and drove through this community times on the way to Dallas. This is a very small community mainly based around farming. It was primarily settled by Czech immigrants and the culture of the town is still very Czech (lots of Czech flags, Czech food and many of the older residents still speak Czech). Terrible tragedy for the town and the people there. Obviously questions will (and should be) asked about why such a plant was built so close to a residential community. But at this point, the news here is really about helping the people of the town and making sure they have everything they need. The local Red Cross is organizing caravans to send to West and I encourage people to help out any way they can. President Barack Obama released a statement about the Texas explosions Thursday morning: I want to thank the first responders who worked tirelessly through the night to contain the situation and treat the wounded. My Administration, through FEMA and other agencies, is in close contact with our state and local partners on the ground to make sure there are no unmet needs as search and rescue and response operations continue. West is a town that many Texans hold near and dear to their hearts, and as residents continue to respond to this tragedy, they will have the support of the American people. Waco Police spokesperson William Swanton speaks at a news conference early Thursday after an explosion at a fertilizer plant in the town of West, near Waco, Texas. Photograph: MIKE STONE/REUTERS * Fire crews had been battling a fire at the plant for almost an hour when the explosion happened. Police say another blaze under more anhydrous ammonia tanks was now under control. This CNN video shows a bloodied and understandably emotional Dr George Smith, head of West's medical emergency service. He explains that he was among people trying to evacuate residents from the nursing home when the blast, which he likened to "an atom bomb", happened: There was a major, major explosion. The windows came in on me, the roof came in on me. While the town has only three ambulances there was a training evening taking place with 18 people on duty, Smith said. He did not know the fate of these but was fearful as many were outdoors when the blast struck. Some quotes from Muska, who read from the brief statement. He said that 50 to 60 houses in a five-block radius were "heavily damaged". Residents at the West Rest Haven nursing home were being evacuated at the time. Anyone found in the area of the blast had been evacuated and taken to safety, he said: I do not have an exact number of casualties at this time. Of the hurt, we took over 160 to the Waco hospitals for treatment. Search and rescue teams have been working through the night, combing the West Rest Haven as well as the fertiliser plant, and also a thorough check of the neighborhood. It's continuing as we speak. The mayor of West, Tommy Muska, has spoken briefly to reporters, saying he still does not know how many people died and confirming the figure of around 160 injured people taken to hospitals. Some quotes from that soon. Already there are stories of heroism emerging from the explosion and its aftermath. CNN has spoken to the wife of Marty Marak, a volunteer firefighter who reported for duty after the blast destroyed his home and those of neighbours, and killed his dog. Assuming the West blast does turn out to be an industrial incident rather than a crime, it will be one of many explosions over the years involving ammonia-based chemicals, usually ammonium nitrate. In September 2001 29 people died in the French city of Toulouse when several hundred tonnes of ammonium nitrate ignited at a fertiliser plant. A reporter with the local WacoTrib has the specific police quote about there being no indication yet this was a deliberate blast or fire. The police are still, however, treating the plant as a crime scene just in case. The TV feeds have switched away from the briefing, but beforehand Swanton also said that while the search and rescue operation was in full swing the next step would be an investigation into how it started. On the subject of the school located near the plant (see map), he said: Swanton says he expects the total number of deaths and injuries to rise when daylight arrives and emergency teams are able to conduct a proper search. He adds: We would like to say we hope not, and we will hope for the best and prepare for whatever we come across. Waco police are giving another update at a press conference: they estimate the death toll could be between five and 15. Glass from blown-out shop windows in West. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images More photos are coming in of the extent of the devastation. This shows the effect of the blast in a commercial street in West. The WacoTrib news site has some details on hospitals dealing with casualties. It says Hillcrest hospital in Waco, about 20 miles south of West, had by midnight treated more than 100 people, with around 14 likely to be admitted. None of the injured, who mainly suffered cuts, broken bones and similar injuries associated with flying debris, had died. Two children had been transferred to a facility another 30 miles south in Temple, said the hospital's chief executive, Glenn Robinson. This CNN video has some dramatic footage of flattened cars and damaged buildings near the blast site, and interviews with witnesses. In a grim coincidence the West blast happened on almost the exact anniversary of the worst industrial accident in American history, which also took place in Texas. The Texas City Disaster on 16 April 1947 killed almost 600 people, when a fire ignited a huge quantity of ammonium nitrate on a ship moored in the Galveston Bay port, beginning a chain of explosions and fires.  The country singer Willie Nelson was born and brought up in the small town of Abbott, just over five miles north of West. He sent this tweet earlier. * Fire crews had been battling a fire at the plant for almost an hour when the explosion happened. Police have refused to speculate whether the blast was caused by anhydrous ammonia igniting in the heat of the fire, or if there could be a criminal connection. Police say another blaze under more anhydrous ammonia tanks was now under control. Sergeant William Swanton of Waco police addresses the media in West, Texas Photograph: Larry W. Smith/EPA A Dallas Morning News reporter has been speaking to local people about the huge force of the blast. A local journalist at the scene reports this from a press conference by Dr George Smith from West emergency services. Our science correspondent, Alok Jha, has penned this very brief explainer on why fertiliser is so explosive. We'll have something more comprehensive later: This means that, if you can do the chemical reactions necessary to turn the nitrogen compounds back into nitrogen gas molecules, all that stored energy is released immediately and you get a huge bang. Firefighters earch a destroyed apartment complex near a fertilizer plant in West, Texas. Photograph: LM Otero/AP Driving through the area himself, Swanton said, he likened the destruction to that caused by a tornado, with some homes significantly more damaged than others. Some fires were still raging, he said, with rescue work made more difficultby fractured gas mains and other utilities. He's telling me that he is seeing extreme devastation in some of the homes, in businesses, they are still getting people out. He told reporters that emergency crews were still searching homes, an operation made harder by the fact many were made unsafe by the blast, and still removing injured people. The Dallas Morning News is reporting that the company running the affected fertiliser plant told safety authorities there was no prospect of an explosion at the complex. It says: The fertilizer plant that exploded Wednesday night in West, Texas, reported to the Environmental Protection Agency and local public safety officials that it presented no risk of fire or explosion, documents show. West Fertilizer Co. reported having as much as 54,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on hand in an emergency planning report required of facilities that use toxic or hazardous chemicals. The second worst possibility projected was a leak from a broken hose used to transfer the product, again causing no injuries. The plan says the facility did not have any other dangerous chemicals on hand. It says that the plan was on file with the local fire department and that the company had implemented proper safety rules. Erick Perez, 21, of West, was playing basketball at a nearby school when the fire started. He and his friends thought nothing of it at first, but about a half hour later, the smoke changed color. The blast threw him, his nephew and others to the ground, and showered the area with hot embers, shrapnel and debris.  "The explosion was like nothing I've ever seen before," Perez said. "This town is hurt really bad." This brief medical update comes from a reporter at the WacoTrib.com news website. The remains of a fertilizer plant burn after an explosion in West, near Waco, Texas. Photograph: Mike Stone/Reuters This photograph of the aftermath of the blast gives some sense of the scale of the destruction at the fertiliser plant itself. A massive explosion at a fertiliser plant in Texas has devastated a town, levelling buildings, setting others on fire and causing casualties that authorities fear could run into the hundreds. The blast shook the earth and rolled a huge fireball through the town of West at about 8pm local time on Wednesday, witnesses said, destroying homes and businesses. "It was a like a nuclear bomb went off," the mayor, Tommy Muska, told reporters. "Big old mushroom cloud. There are a lot of people that got hurt. There are a lot of people that will not be here tomorrow." Two people were immediately reported killed but the death toll could rise to 60 or 70, said George Smith, an emergency management system director. "That's a really rough number, I'm getting that figure from firefighters, we don't know yet." Firefighters were feared to be among the casualties. Glenn Robinson, chief executive of Hillcrest Baptist Medical Centre in Waco, 18 miles south of the town, told CNN his hospital had treated 66 people, including 38 who were seriously hurt with blast injuries and lacerations. David Argueta, vice-president of hospital operations, said staff had treated lacerations and orthopaedic-type injuries. "We are being told that we have seen most of the patients, and it's now turned into a search-and-rescue operation on scene." A spokesman for the Texas department of public safety, DL Wilson, told Reuters the blast had probably caused "hundreds of casualties". A nursing home had collapsed and people were believed trapped inside, he said. It registered as an earth tremor of magnitude 2.1. West, located in McLennan county in central Texas, is about 80 miles south of Dallas. It has a population of 2,700. The blast from its fertiliser plant was heard at least 45 miles away. Television pictures showed apocalyptic scenes of fire and smoke from ruined buildings close to the factory. There was no immediate confirmation on what caused the apparent accident, which followed a terrorist attack in Boston. US Representative Bill Flores, whose district includes West, told CNN he doubted foul play was involved. "I would not expect sabotage by any stretch of the imagination." This is a pretty full summary of what we know so far on the WacoTrib.com website. West Mayor Tommy Muska said shortly after 11 p.m. that six or seven firefighters were in the plant at the time of the explosion and they are not accounted for. A surgeon in Waco has tweeted this update, passed on by the @wacotrib local Twitter news feed. D. L Wilson, a Texas Department of Safety spokesman, told a news conference the damage was comparable to the destruction caused by the 1995 bomb blast which destroyed a large building in Oaklahoma City, killing 168 people. Authorities in West say it will be some time before they know the extent of those injured or killed in the fertiliser plant explosion. A house on fire after the explosion in West, Texas. Photograph: Rod Aydelotte/AP Emergency crews are reported to be pulling back from the fertiliser plant because of concerns about another explosion. The fire is thought to have started in an anhydrous ammonia tank before it spread to the buildings at the plant. More than 80 people are believed to be being treated in a number of hospitals as a result of the explosion. The blast ripped a 50-unit apartment building apart, leaving little more than a skeleton, Wilson said. The Waco Herald Tribune newspaper reported that many buildings had caught fire as a result of the explosion at the West Fertilizer company. The instant that the burning fertiliser plant exploded, caught on camera by people who were watching nearby. Their terrible shock is clearly evident. A video taken by some understandably fearful residents in the West area as a mushroom cloud loomed on the horizon in the minutes afterwards. Some strong language. The fire that tore through the fertiliser factory in West sent a plume of flames and smoke high into the air. Local residents described the explosion as sounding like a bomb had gone off. The windows in some residential houses a mile away from the explosion were blown out. Nearby residents have been evacuated from their homes. A huge blast at a fertiliser factory is feared to have killed dozens of people in the American state of Texas. The explosion in the town of West at 7.50pm Wednesday night local time apparently caused a large fireball and shockwave that ripped through surrounding buildings, including a school and nearby nursing home.
