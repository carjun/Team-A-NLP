Not many things will be out of place in this subreddit, anything that crosses our teenage minds will be allowed.  A reminder that tumblr links are often caught in the spam filter, facebook links often contain personal information, and that images should be rehosted on imgur or minus to avoid these issues. We'd like to remind everyone that /r/teenagers is a place on Reddit where users absolutely shouldn't be judged for their age, gender, sexuality, race, creed, nationality, gender identification, religion (or lack thereof), or anything else we forgot to include. Just don't judge people. Tags have now been replaced by link flair: please use link flair to tag posts, especially memes (see rules beneath) As per reddit's privacy policy, if you are under 13 you require parental consent to post on this subreddit as of 15th May 2013.
