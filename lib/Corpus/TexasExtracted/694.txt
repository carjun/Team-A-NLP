A majority of the dead were firefighters from five fire departments and one ambulance service who had rushed to the scene to battle the blaze and started to evacuate people when the plant exploded. Ten firefighters in all were killed, the worst disaster for Texas firefighters in more than 60 years.         The department had five engines and trucks; now, it has two. On Friday night, trucks and firefighters from Waxahachie and other towns were in the fire station, covering the day-to-day duties so that members of the West department could recuperate and grieve among themselves and their loved ones.         Among the 10 firefighters who died was Kenny Harris, 52, a captain with Dallas Fire-Rescue. He lived in West and had been off duty when he learned of the fire at the plant and responded to the scene, officials said. Two others who died were Cyrus Reed and Jerry Chapman, both members of the Abbott Volunteer Fire Department, a town seven miles north of West, according to an Abbott town official.         By Saturday afternoon, normalcy had yet to return to West, a town of 2,700 that is a kind of Czech-American outpost in the region and home to Czech bakeries, restaurants and a Knights of Columbus Hall that hosts Czech polka bands.         The explosion destroyed water lines, leaving much of the town without water. Three days after the explosion, service had yet to be restored to many homes and businesses.         Town officials planned to open a part of the area near the blast site to residents on Saturday, though they said a curfew enforced by the authorities would be in place nightly starting at 7.

Many writers label Wi-Fi a distraction, but the impulse to connect with the outside world is an ancient one.
