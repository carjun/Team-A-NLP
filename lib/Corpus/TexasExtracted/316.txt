I do take pleasure in parking within inches of their driver door when they can't park within the lines, though. That's always good for a laugh.  You know what else is hilarious? My brother is a Fort Worth police officer, and he loves giving tickets to drivers of huge trucks. We all laugh at family dinners when he tells us how he is 10x more likely to pull over and ticket a huge truck instead of a smaller car. What do you care what someone drives? Who are you to tell them what they should or should not be driving? But all of these are aggregate issues. They only matter as large parts of the whole. Any given individual really has no stake in what any other individual drives.  Both points of view can be relevant, but it depends on the frame of reference. This is why it makes sense to require national gas mileage standards to increase, while at the same time allowing you to buy an H3 that gets 7 mpg highway. Both sets of my grandparents were ranchers and used trucks to haul trailers, tractors, loads of supplies, what-have-you. I cringe when I see someone in stop and go traffic in the city driving to their office job in a polished up F250.  Aaaaaaaand after dealing with that you have to do a two or three-point turn to actually be able to clear the obnoxiously long fuckers.  If they idle along at 45 mph on I-635 blocking traffic, if they take up a lane and a half, if they take an hour and a half to keep going when a light turns green, when they think screw it, I'll change lanes whenever I want, I don't need to look or signal, better get outta my way or you're gonna get squished, when they park taking up four spaces... yes I fucking DO care we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
