Don't feel bad I heard obama say we're a democracy just this week and his degree is in consitutional law.   I know how you feel about the liquor store charges.  I was spending $42/day every day for about 6 months.  20 bucks a day on the beer then 9 bucks a bottle X2 per day + tax.  I was spending a very nice house payment each month on just alcohol.  And get this we were both smokers throw in almost 10 bucks a day in smokes.  Yeah we were very sick at that time.  We were spending around 1500 bucks per month on shit you never actually own.  ------Face Palm! I hope you're doing better after this ordeal and use this experience to allow you to see both sides of the situation.   My dad is retired hwy patrol.  He went through the academy when it was old school and a couple dudes died during boxing sessions.  He said that one of his instructors during the class time said something that always stuck with him "Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear."  My dad was later invited to become part of the Texas Rangers.  (not the baseball team)   Good luck bro!  I would be glad to know a cop like you that knew how easy it is to sway a listening ear and knowing better than to fall for the dansel in distress with blood on her knuckles.   My father's words have stuck out in all aspects of my life.  (even though I'm not a cop) we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
