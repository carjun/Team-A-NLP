I don't like any of the NA teams personally, at all, nothing about any of them is impressive to me, the only one that did stand a chance though was C9. Get some Canadian teams/players in there and I hold some reason to hold bias for NA teams, till then I have no reason to give a shit about "NA" teams winning or losing :P Bt, cleaver/lw, tri force, IE, cleaver/lw, ga or zehpyr depending if i feel i need the ga or not A) his passive. Which is a steroid of its own. Late game with crit does some massive damage of its own. B) Short cooldowns combined with said passive will pit out a lot.of damage. With blue buff even more so. Get him 40% cdr and his damage will just roll in. C) vayne i agree is better. But if you lane lucian vs vayne, at least in my experience. Youll get fed with ease in lane and completely zone her and she will never make it to hyper carry. D) snowball's so incredibly hard if you get him slightly ahead due to really strong laneing. Im not really trying to argue the hyper carry title for him. But he's damn close to it. A lot of peoples problem on him is terrible build thinking attack speed is useful.on him when its not. Same for Bork, its bad early item for him. But that's just my opinion. He also scales incredibly good with AD lol, I don't know where you're getting that from. He'll also slaughter a vayne in lane, and go on to out carry her with ease... Get him to a 3 item build of BT, LW/Cleaver (take your pick) and Tri force. As long as you aren't behind everyone else getting there, you'll obliterate anyone you want. Throw an IE in after that, and just go to town. Also anyone who says build a bork or any real form of attack speed on him is full of shit, it's terrible. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
