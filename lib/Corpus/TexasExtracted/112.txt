The number of deaths and injuries could still grow as search and recovery efforts continue at the site of the plant, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. The explosion rocked the rural Texas town Wednesday night, flattening buildings for blocks around the fertilizer plant. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation. Of the individuals confirmed dead, five were volunteer firefighters, four were emergency medical technicians, and four were civilians, according to the mayor of West, Tommy Musko. Crews have searched the plant, a nearby nursing home, and a nearby apartment building that were all severely damaged. All 144 people inside the nursing home made it out alive, according to mayor. Approximately 200 people were injured in the blasts and fire, including emergency personnel who first responded to the scene. Crews have cleared 150 buildings that were wrecked in the explosion, and are working to clear an additional 25 homes. One EMS vehicle and three fire vehicles were also destroyed, the DPS said. The fire and explosion just before 8 p.m. Wednesday at the West Fertilizer Plant prompted widespread evacuations and sent dozens of people to hospitals. The explosion devastated the area that officials described as a highly-populated neighborhood.
