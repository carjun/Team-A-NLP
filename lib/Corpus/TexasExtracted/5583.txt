I am not a fan of 105 on an orange pad. That is not to say it can't fit into your workflow though. You will have a ton more cut. Follow up with an orange pad with a medium cut polish then move forward with the 205 on a white/gray/whatever works best. Again, screw what we think bro. Get that sucker where YOU want it. You're jumping in the rabbit hole when you ask for advice. Look at me for instance. I said it looked great for what you did and after some prodding I just suggested that you could do this and then that(which will probably double the amount of time you've invested in this one project). haha! I had one I used all the time and literally broke the end connector after about a year. The steam still worked but I had no way to connect the tips to it. For the money, it's an awesome little machine and builds steam in about 5 minutes. People are used to being treated like a number. When you slow down and enjoy your time with your patrons you also build a relationship. Some of my clients have become buddies. More often than not clay by itself will generate micro marring. It's the nature of rubbing anything against your paint, much less when you're rubbing something against your paint which is grabbing up sand. OP, I would suggest you first look into some options to remove the debris with chemical and hot water cleaning. A hot water pressure washer may do the trick by itself. Either way, my heart goes out to you on this one. Hearing how sand has bonded to your paint is sickening. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
