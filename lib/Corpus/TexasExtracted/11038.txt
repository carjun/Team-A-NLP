VOASites by Language   Top Stories:   1 Boston Bombing Suspect Dead, Police Search for Other   Musharraf Under House Arrest in Pakistan    Police and rescue workers stand near a building which was left destroyed from a massive explosion at a nearby fertilizer plant in the town of West, near Waco, Texas April 18, 2013. 		Rescuers in the southern U.S. state of Texas continue to search for survivors in the ruins of a small town where a fertilizer plant exploded with the force of a small earthquake. Police say up to 15 people may have been killed and more than 160 were injured from the Wednesday night explosion in the farm town of West, Texas. Authorities fear they may find more bodies as they search the approximately 80 houses destroyed in the explosion, which may have been caused by a fire. Investigators are concerned about potentially dangerous chemicals at the site. A National Guard team has been dispatched to monitor for hazardous emissions. Texas Governor Rick Perry on Thursday called the situation a "truly nightmare scenario." He said much of the information on the victims remains "very preliminary." Authorities have not determined how the initial fire started at the plant. Patrick Swanton, spokesman for the nearby Waco police department, says the site is being treated as a crime scene, but insists there is no evidence to suggest it was anything other than an accident. A nearby high school football field was turned into an emergency staging area to treat the victims. West's 2,800 residents were evacuated. Emergency crews from dozens of nearby towns and counties traveled to West to assist with the response. Governor Perry says state resources have been mobilized to provide assistance to local authorities. The U.S. Geological Survey says the massive explosion registered as a 2.1-magnitude earthquake. It was felt up to 80 kilometers away.
