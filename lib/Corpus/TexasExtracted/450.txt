By the way, had Obamacare never came and had we passed a budget, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.  This is ILLEGAL.  This can be considered persecution of a religion. The President has no authority to do this.  Threatening an arrest if someone volunteers is also illegal.  This is disregarding FREEDOM OF RELIGION, which is illegal. I got this news just now from my local radio station,and am 100% outraged.  Obama needs to be impeached. He gives 0 information about anything relating to the weather.  Just sucks up to our female news anchor.   EDIT:  What I mean is, FOX actually acknowledges that they have a conservative slant.  CNN and MSNBC deny their extreme liberal slant.  They also never question, which is what intelligent media should do.  All they do is agree with whatever President Obama does/says. Fox is news. They actually have decent news programming. CNN has been lagging behind Fox for so long. MSNBC is basically the "We agree with Obama every time and he is never wrong network"  I prefer Fox for news, even as a moderate (not R or D) we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
