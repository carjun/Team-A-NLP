Edit: Slightly outdated, but 2008 census shows a reported 89000 cases of rape of men and women. Mostly women though about 91% according the the report. Lets say that 5 times that either died or didn't report the rape, 445000 people. Population was roughly 310000000 people in the us. A percent of a percent of the population would have experienced rape. That is assuming 5 times the amount of reports were withheld for some reason. Of the total population 178000000 are woman. If 1 in 6 woman experienced rape in their life there would be 29500000 rapes in a 80-90 year period. That is 331 times the amount of reported rapes. Once again, come back with facts. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
