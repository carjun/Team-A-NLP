Updated2daysago'Our hearts are broken': Texas town grieves in wake of devastating blastAuthorities in the small community of West, Texas, which was stunned by a massive explosion in a fertilizer plant on Wednesday, are searching for survivors and clues about what caused the blast, believed to be an accident.By M. Alex Johnson, John Newland and Tracy Connor, NBC NewsSearches resumed at a fertilizer plant early Friday after residents of the Texas town devastated by an explosion gathered to mourn their community's losses. Officials have said as many as 15 people may have died and more than 160 others were injured in the blast, which occurred just before 8 p.m. local time (9 p.m. ET) Wednesday in the farming town of West a few miles north of Waco. "The area around the site is just total devastation," Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said at a news conference Thursday night. He said an apartment complex that was flattened "looks like it was a bombing site of an explosion the kind that you see in Baghdad." Police initially said between five and 15 people may have been killed, and Mayor Tommy Muska, a member of the town's Fire Department, told NBC News that he feared those numbers could double. But state officials said it was too soon to say how many had died. But while the toll is "immense," said Abbott, the attorney general, "the other thing we clearly saw in touring around West is the clear sign of hope. You can see hope in the eyes of the rescue workers. ... You can see already the beginnings of the community working to piece itself back together."State officials said the plant had been at the site since 1962. Its state authorization lapsed at some point, but after a 2006 complaint about a smell of ammonia in the air, it came back into compliance, and there have been no more issues.Satellite view showing the location of West Fertilizer Co. in West, Texas.Police said that soon after the blast there was one possible report of a looting incident but that it was "not rampant," and no one was being allowed into the search area.There were also reports of price gouging, said Abbott, who promised that profiteers "will be facing a lawsuit by the Texas attorney general."In a statement, President Barack Obama thanked first responders, pledged support and offered prayers."A tight-knit community has been shaken, and good, hard-working people have lost their lives," Obama said.Michelle Acevedo, Gabe Gutierrez, Edgar Zuniga Jr. and Matthew DeLuca of NBC News and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Related: Texas fertilizer plant also stored explosive chemical used in Oklahoma City bombMayor of Texas town rocked by explosion: 'We're going to fight back''The whole street is gone': Bloodied eyewitnesses describe Texas explosion horrorWest Fertilizer had few violations, was pillar of communityTexas fertilizer tragedy: How to helpThis story was originally published on Thu Apr 18, 2013 8:56 PM EDT2240commentsExplore related topics: texas, fire, explosion, us-news, breaking-news, featured, waco, fertilizer, updated older2daysagoMichigan woman, 75, gets at least 22 years in prison for killing grandsonnewer2daysago'I feel blessed': Boston Marathon runner who escaped bombing unscathed also witnessed Texas plant explosion Most popular postsolder2daysagoMichigan woman, 75, gets at least 22 years in prison for killing grandsonnewer2daysago'I feel blessed': Boston Marathon runner who escaped bombing unscathed also witnessed Texas plant explosionMost popular posts5430Explosions rock finish of Boston Marathon; 3 killed and scores injuredUpdated5daysago4189Investigator pleads for help in marathon bombing probe: 'Someone knows who did this'Updated4daysago3819Bombing suspects: Brothers with foreign roots, American livesUpdated1dayago5370FBI releases new photos of suspects in Boston Marathon bombingUpdated2daysago1167Lone officer confronted marathon bombing suspects in firefight, chief saysUpdated10hoursago Browsefeatured, crime, military, weather, california, florida, environment, us-news, new-york, shooting, texas, education, updated, chicago, police, gulf-oil-spill, kari-huus, los-angeles, murder, nbcnewyork, new-jersey, afghanistan, obama, guns, sandy, colorado, trayvon-martin, barack-obama, crime-and-courts, nbclosangeles, politics, gay, veterans, religion, connecticut, george-zimmerman, fire, snow Archives2013April (411)March (548)February (510)January (563)2012December (457)November (460)October (477)September (432)August (525)July (519)June (508)May (566)April (538)March (576)February (471)January (417)2011December (455)November (190)October (9)September (3)August (51)July (8)June (3)May (12)April (5)March (3)February (1)January (8)2010December (5)November (1)October (2)September (28)August (40)July (35)June (177)May (50)April (9)March (2)February (2)January (4)2009December (5)November (5)October (2)September (11)August (4)July (12)June (1)May (1)April (1)March (3)February (3)January (2)2008December (3)November (2)October (6)September (30)August (26)July (10)June (4)May (8)April (13)March (9)February (7)January (6)2007December (10)November (6)October (22)September (11)Most Commented'We got him!': Boston bombing suspect captured alive (8013)Explosions rock finish of Boston Marathon; 3 killed and scores injured (5430)FBI releases new photos of suspects in Boston Marathon bombing (5370)Investigator pleads for help in marathon bombing probe: 'Someone knows who did this' (4189)Bombing suspects: Brothers with foreign roots, American lives (3819)Feds arrest suspect in ricin-positive letters sent to Obama, senator (3088)'Our hearts are broken': Texas town grieves in wake of devastating blast (2240)Other blogsThe Body OddCosmic LogRed Tape ChroniclesPhotoBlogGadgetboxTechnologUS NewsOpen ChannelInGame top stories
