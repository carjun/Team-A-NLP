The deadly fire and explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant highlights the often-overlooked risks of storing large amounts of potentially combustible fertilizer, a common practice across rural America. The West Fertilizer Co. plant had operated in the small town of West, Texas, for more than half a century, little noticed by neighbors or government regulators. According to a report filed to state and local officials as required by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency, the West Fertilizer plant stored as much as 540,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and 110,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. It is one of at least 587 Texas facilities that store anhydrous ammonia, according to an analysis of EPA data by the Center for Effective Government, a private group. West Fertilizer employed seven people, according to its EPA filing. There are hundreds of distributors like West Fertilizer scattered across farm states. The businesses and farmer cooperatives take delivery from fertilizer producers and resell it to area farmers, often making blends to match soil conditions or other local factors. Fertilizer is moved around the nation by rail, barge and truck, with U.S. farmers using 60.4 million tons in 2011, the most recent data, up 8.6% from 2010, according to the Fertilizer Institute, a trade group. The EPA fined the plant $2,300 in 2006 for not having an emergency plan for handling anhydrous ammonia; operators were supposed to file the plan in 2004. The most recent plan, filed in 2011, said the operation did not pose a risk of either explosion or fire. In January 2012, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration fined West Fertilizer more than $5,000 for transporting anhydrous ammonia in unauthorized cargo tanks and for failing to develop and follow a security plan, according to agency records. On Thursday, government officials flooded the small town of 2,800 people. The EPA said it is working with Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Texas Committee on Environmental Quality to monitor air quality in the area. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which investigates chemical accidents, dispatched an investigative team. The town and the fertilizer plant grew up together. The Plasek family started the company as Texas Grain Storage Inc. in 1957, according to a lawsuit the company filed in 2007. It later built a small fertilizer-blend plant and started selling fertilizer to area farmers. Zak Covar, executive director of the environmental-quality commission, said the fertilizer storage and blending facility had existed since 1962, before permits were required, and was allowed to remain on the site.
