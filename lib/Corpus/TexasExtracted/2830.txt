Can we narrow down what we want to retweet? Like, i don't want to retweet health and beauty products on my 3D printing Twitter page. That doesnt make sense. We were able to calculate exact prices right on the list of queried search results. So let's let's say 10 results for Raleigh populate, on Makexyz you would have to upload your STL to each Printer in order to find out the price. Now, regardless of what the Printer sets as his default print price, you can see all 10 printers prices calculated on the same page. And also, with a name like 3D Pinpoint, we are able to expand into a whole spectrum of new ideas/services. Future implementations will hopefully include "Find a filament reseller", "Find a Designer(for editing/ resizing designs), "Find a 3D scanner" etc. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
