Several is not the term I would use to describe the 5 out of 50 that are not participating.  But this doesn't happen if the top levels of the corporation are running a good ship. I am an employee for Chic-Fil-A. Even though Chic-Fil-A has independent franchises, the top levels take responsibility in making sure that their store owners are prepared enough to operate a successful store that can take care of its employees and is ethically sound. While each location may be privately owned, there can still be no excuses made, pardoning the upper levels of the company when problems arise. The top levels of the company are ultimately responsible; unethical practices can affect a company like the plague, and this isn't the first time I've heard of corruption and unfair dealings within Papa John's. But when you operate a business with only net profit in mind, these are the results. You would never see this kind of thing happening at Chic-Fil-A, I can guarantee you that. I'm thinking we should incorporate that idea to our subreddit, but just have it be the Falcons logo to upvote and downvote be the Saints logo all the time. Also if you're a big looking dude and the store's empty, ask for a little burger and half the time you'll get a free 2nd patty That's kinda fucked up, honestly. Maybe big dude didn't want the extra burger and that's why he didn't order it.  With the talent USC has they should have won without even worrying about the coaches. Sounds like a bunch of entitled kids pointing the blame towards a bunch of entitled coaches.  we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
