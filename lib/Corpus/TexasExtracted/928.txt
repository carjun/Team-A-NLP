The mandated federal budget cuts that went into effect on April 1 will make cancer clinics go broke if they give Medicare patients the chemotherapy they need, oncologists claim. Medicare patients will be referred to hospitals for cancer treatments because of deep sequester cuts, making some procedures dangerously costly for older Americans.  	The so-called sequester cuts will force three-quarters of the thousands of cancer clinics nationwide to start referring Medicare patients to hospitals, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology and other cancer treatment groups, which have appealed to the White House and Congress for help. 	Elderly cancer patients are being hit hard because their drugs are among the handful of pharmaceuticals that were affected by the sequester cuts. 	But the Republican-led House of Representatives refused to compromise with President Obama and the sequester went into effect.       On Thursday, astronomers announced in two different studies that NASA's Kepler telescope had spotted three far-off planets that could potentially support life.
