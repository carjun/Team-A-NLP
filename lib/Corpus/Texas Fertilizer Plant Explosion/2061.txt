permalinksaveparent[+]lasergumball 183 points184 points185 points 5 months ago  (24 children)[–]lasergumball 183 points184 points185 points 5 months agoBeen hit by several IEDs.  Close-by explosions are the worst.  They hurt your entire body at once.  It's like getting hit by a fucking freight train.  I can imagine how terrifying it was for the family in the video.

permalinksaveparent[+]galient5 161 points162 points163 points 5 months ago  (13 children)[–]galient5 161 points162 points163 points 5 months agoIt's literally the same principle as getting hit be a freight train, just that it isn't a solid object you are being hit by.

permalinksaveparent[+]phidelta355 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]phidelta355 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoNot to get pedantic, but I would wager at a close enough distance, the force of the shockwave from a large explosion is equal or greater than being hit by a train moving at ~30-40 mph, and it obviously increases the closer you are or stronger the explosion.
So yes, air is not a solid object, but in the right conditions, it might as well be.

permalinksaveparent[+]A_HIDDEN_TEEMO 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]A_HIDDEN_TEEMO 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoIt is worse.  The shockwave give no fucks about bones or skin; it will fuck up your internal squishies.

permalinksaveparent[+]DonkeyKong92 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]DonkeyKong92 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIt's the pressure wave that hits you.

permalinksaveparent[+]galient5 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]galient5 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoWell, it's energy being released from the blast that hits you, similar to energy from a moving train hitting you.

permalinksaveparent[+]Room16 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Room16 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoEnergy equals mass times velocity 

permalinksaveparent[+]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThere's a reason that explosions are measured in weight.

permalinksaveparent[+]galient5 5 points6 points7 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]galient5 5 points6 points7 points 5 months agoNo, literally, seeing as the principle is that of kinetic energy being transferred to the object being "hit."

permalinksaveparent[+]Argy 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Argy 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoDoes the pressure wave typically damage the vehicle that people are riding in? I'm just wondering if this family's truck got dented up or scorched or anything.
