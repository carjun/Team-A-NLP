permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 400 points401 points402 points 5 months ago* (42 children)[–]HandShoes 400 points401 points402 points 5 months ago*That's a very very rough estimate by firefighters. They don't have a confirmed number. I live right outside the town about five minutes away and it's pure chaos here.

Totally kidding, I sincerely hope nobody close to you was involved in the accident. This is a horrible tragedy.

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 176 points177 points178 points 5 months ago* (27 children)[–]HandShoes 176 points177 points178 points 5 months ago*A few relatives houses were leveled and my brother's girlfriend's dad was fighting the fire when it exploded but he's okay now. I don't believe anyone close to me was severely injured from what I have heard and I'm really grateful for that.

permalinksaveparent[+]THEUSERNAMETAKER 99 points100 points101 points 5 months ago  (8 children)[–]THEUSERNAMETAKER 99 points100 points101 points 5 months agoYou should really consider leaving the area for a while, that is, if you haven't already considered it....
According to /u/TheCynicalIdealist's comment here, the remnants of the chemicals are extremely toxic and dangerous. Good luck!

permalinksaveparent[+]whosthedoginthisscen 13 points14 points15 points 5 months ago  (6 children)[–]whosthedoginthisscen 13 points14 points15 points 5 months agoSeconded.  Don't wait for them to tell you in a couple of days that the air is toxic, go find a hotel somewhere for a couple three days.

permalinksaveparent[+]what__year_is__this 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]what__year_is__this 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoThey've been mentioning concerns about air quality on the news already. Sounds like people that live downwind (to the north) are possibly being asked to shelter in place. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Shalaiyn 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Shalaiyn 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThe combustion of ammonium nitrate doesn't give "extremely toxic and dangerous" chemicals actually, luckily. The only thing will be the NOx, which still warrants caution, however, they carry an odour reminding one of chlorine, so if you smell chlorine, get the hell away.

Edit: Was he hundreds of yards away from the fire he was fighting?  Idk much about firefighting.    

permalinksaveparent[+]kaneing 6 points7 points8 points 5 months ago  (6 children)[–]kaneing 6 points7 points8 points 5 months agoYeah...I can't imagine anyone being anywhere near that thing when it exploded and being "okay"

permalinksaveparent[+]c3bball 7 points8 points9 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]c3bball 7 points8 points9 points 5 months agopure luck? its amazing sometimes how people can be involved in the most ridiculous disasters and survive. Theres an acount in this wikipedia article of a stewardess surviving a free fall of 33,000 feet. Life is just really weird like sometimes.

permalinksaveparent[+]neurochild 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]neurochild 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoEven if he was lucky enough to not get torn to shreds by the sheer force of the explosion and the fire, etc, there's no way he wouldn't be deaf. I don't consider that okay, lol. Even OP's son couldn't hear anything, and they were almost a mile away.

permalinksaveparent[+]The_Derpening 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]The_Derpening 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoYup. I saw a documentary about tornadoes once and they talked about a guy who was lifted and thrown miles away from his house which got absolutely destroyed, and he woke up hours later without so much as a sore muscle.

permalinksaveparent[+]rainbowbarf 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]rainbowbarf 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoWere many people informed about the danger that building catching fire?

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]HandShoes 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoFrom what I've heard, this kind of thing is very rare. I don't think many people knew it was on fire until it actually exploded.

permalinksaveparent[+]Kutzie 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Kutzie 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI feel weird about the ads playing before the videos at a news site when they cover something like this. You know?

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoRight now, they're evacuating the north part of town and may have to evacuate the rest later because of the ammonia in the air. There's really not many more details so far.

permalinksaveparent[+]Kirsham 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]Kirsham 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoHow far away are you (in distance, not time)? I assume you felt and heard the explosion, could you describe the whole ordeal (what you felt, what you thought...)?

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]HandShoes 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI was at my friend's about 6 or so miles (he lives very close to me) away. We heard it and it sounded like something fell on the house so we went outside. His dad then told us the plant exploded and his mom's windshield had been blown out so we immediately jumped in the car to go see if she was okay, which she was. It was hard to see anything because the town was so chaotic so the extent of what I know is what I've seen on the news so far. It's really hard to believe something like this is happening just 5 or 6 miles away from me right now.

permalinksaveparent[+]Kirsham 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Kirsham 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoDamn, glad I'm not in your shoes right now, not to mention those hurt and killed. Stay safe.

permalinksaveparent[+]TheSalingerAngle 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]TheSalingerAngle 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThey should have stayed vague on the number of dead and not even given an estimate. Of course, even if they said the number was between 1 and infinity, the media would run with "Infinity People Killed in Factory Explosion". Hasty social media updates aren't helping either.

permalinksaveparent[+]YourMomWorks4Me -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]YourMomWorks4Me -1 points0 points1 point 5 months agoI'm about half an hour away and everything is fine and dandy here... As if nothing has happened at all.

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoEven five minutes away it's as if nothing happened. It's so weird.

permalinksaveparent[+]cockyjeremy 44 points45 points46 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]cockyjeremy 44 points45 points46 points 5 months agoAt least. That was listed almost immediately. Hundreds really wouldn't shock me.

permalinksaveparent[+]grinde 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]grinde 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoThe original source of that number pulled the estimate. At the moment there are less than 10 confirmed dead. Though honestly I wouldn't doubt there could be ten times that. 

permalinksaveparent[+]cockyjeremy 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]cockyjeremy 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoGood. Hopefully it ends up being a lot less. As widespread as it is, I think it'll be a while before we really know.

permalinksaveparent[+]Rather_Dashing 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Rather_Dashing 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoWhat do you mean at least, the 60-70 figure comes from this guy:
Fire officials fear that the number of casualties could rise as high as 60 to 70 dead
Only several deaths have been so far confirmed and the toll was only predicted to go as high as 60-70 not 60-70 minimum. There way be more then that but lets not get carried away.

permalinksaveparent[+]austinmartinyes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]austinmartinyes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThe area isn't condensed enough. The central part of Texas is very spread out, and 60-70 sounds like the right number of people that would be in a plant like that.

permalinksaveparent[+]Tahrin 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Tahrin 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agothis is actually just an estimated figure by EMS Director Dr. George Smith, there have not been any official totals confirmed at this time.  "West Mayor Tommy Muska said at a news conference however, that he doesn't yet know how many people were hurt or killed in the blast explosion, but said four or five firefighters are unaccounted for."

permalinksaveparent[+]herky140 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]herky140 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoCNN is still only stating 2 confirmed dead. I'd consider that a very rough estimate.

I turned the TV on after seeing about this online, and the TV is fucking covering local weather due to it being rainy. What the hell?? If this was Boston today, there would be nonstop coverage yet I have yet to hear about TX, everything seems to be like a casual news day. This is borderline fear mongering by the media. Oh 70 dead at a plant explosion, likely an accident, no big deal. 2 dead due to possible terrorist attack?! BREAKING FUCKING NEWS.
