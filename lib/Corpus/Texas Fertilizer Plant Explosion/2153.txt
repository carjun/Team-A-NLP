One of the best things I'd heard from someone who'd been dealing with the loss of a loved one was "It never gets easy, but it does get less hard." I have found that to be the truest statement I've ever heard in my life. I'm sorry that you have to go through such a terrible thing and know that there are people here who have been through similar things and are here if you need us.
