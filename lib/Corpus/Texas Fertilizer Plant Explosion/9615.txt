permalinksavecontextfull comments (98)/u/Blacksheep01 tells his story about the right way to approach a liberal arts degree (and how to get a job afterwards)  by  aescolanusin  bestof[+]lukemcr 5 points6 points7 points 14 days ago  (0 children)[–]lukemcr 5 points6 points7 points 14 days agoWhat are you good at? Whatever it is, you should do that. What are you slightly-more-than-competent at, actually? If you work hard, you should be able to get a job doing whatever that is. If the job for whatever it is that you're good at requires an undergraduate degree, then go to community college - they'll accept basically anyone, because that's their job!
Don't worry about grades while you're in college - you don't need to put your GPA on your resume, trust me.
