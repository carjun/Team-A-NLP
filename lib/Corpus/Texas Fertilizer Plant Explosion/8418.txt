And it isn't for a cop; he should be punished. 
I'm agreeing with you on that.
But the pitchforks and torches against cops in this thread is uncalled for.

[NSFW]ish (violence/blood)  by  NecroGodin  WTF[+]Gingold 0 points1 point2 points 17 days ago  (0 children)[–]Gingold 0 points1 point2 points 17 days agoHow serious it is doesn't make it suddenly not a mistake. He made a poor judgement and acted wrongfully resulting in an obvious yet unintended consequence i.e. a mistake. 
It's not an excuse, but it's still an accident. I just think we should focus on the cases where it was malicious intentional instead.

I'm not arguing that her injuries weren't a result of his actions because they clearly were; 
He made a mistake that resulted in an ugly accident. 
He is in the wrong. This isn't malicious police brutality. The anti-cop circle jerk here is uncalled for. Focus on the real scumbags who do this shit on purpose.

She didn't want to get in the cell, he chose a poor method of getting her into the cell that did not go as he planned and resulted in an injury. 
Malicious police brutality deserves this kind of outrage, not some cop who fucked up and unintentionally injured a noncompliant suspect.
I see no example of malicious intent in this video and it seems like an isolated event (unless someone can provide me with proof of this cop having a history of similar misconduct). Not an excuse for his behavior at all, but let's not start bashing everyone who has ever worn a badge because of it.

He pushed her into her cell that she was not cooperating in entering and she fell face first! 
That doesn't make it okay in any way shape or form, but we don't have to sensationalize it and make her a saint and him Satan;
He should be punished accordingly for his gross and inappropriate handling of a DUI suspect that was uncooperative, but we shouldn't use this as evidence that all police are evil pigs that are out to hurt you. 
He fucked up, plain and simple. He should face punishment because of it. That said, we should focus on the police who actually throw innocent people face first into the concrete on purpose and maliciously instead of those that fucked up causing an accident.

[NSFW]ish (violence/blood)  by  NecroGodin  WTF[+]Gingold 3 points4 points5 points 17 days ago  (0 children)[–]Gingold 3 points4 points5 points 17 days agoOr maybe nobody posts sensationalized videos of cops doing their jobs correctly and without complication. 
This cop obviously handled the situation wrong, but this doesn't prove the majority of cops are power tripping thugs at all. This case has several shades of morally gray all over it; we should focus on the cops who actually are doing shit like this out of malicious intent and not on accident because they handled a non complaint DUI suspect wrongfully. 
There are better cases out there against bad cops and malicious police brutality.  This just looks like a cop under stress who accidentally fucked up.

[NSFW]ish (violence/blood)  by  NecroGodin  WTF[+]Gingold 2 points3 points4 points 17 days ago  (0 children)[–]Gingold 2 points3 points4 points 17 days agoIt looks like something happened off camera, because she was allowed to go make her call walking out of the cell unassisted
Then she's going back in with the "help" of two cops and gets pushed into the cell with her arms out like she is grabbing for the sides of the cell entrance. 
the cop was in the wrong, but she was not cooperating with getting back in the cell. That's what it looks like in the video to me. Definitely handled wrong, but not with malicious intent.

It wasn't okay at all,  but by no means an excuse to sensationalize and bash all cops as brutal thugs

[NSFW]ish (violence/blood)  by  NecroGodin  WTF[+]Gingold 8 points9 points10 points 17 days ago  (0 children)[–]Gingold 8 points9 points10 points 17 days agoI don't think that the cop intended for that to happen;
she resisted being put back in the cell and an unfortunate accident happened. I highly doubt he intended for her to smash her face into the bench in any way shape or form.
That isn't an excuse for what happened, just saying that it doesn't appear to be malicious. And I don't think this anti-cop circle jerk is carrying much weight. 
Lets not forget, everyone makes mistakes. Like this cop who applied to much force to get the woman back into her cell. Like the woman, who was there in the first place after being arrested for DUI.
The world isn't black and white; not all cops are civilian-beating Hitlers.
