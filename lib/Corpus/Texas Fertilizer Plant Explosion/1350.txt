In that sense if you don't live in a software city then you'll probably have to move.  All kinds of businesses need CS people, but most just want cheap and capable so they will hire people with a BS.

Even then don't plan on working with them unless it's clear they are willing to work for you.  Don't give them jack shit either.  You owe them nothing.

Everyone is on a continuum of ability and those that can't code do IT or play with network gear or schmooze or whatever.  Once a person no longer codes they are no longer using tech skills to the same degree.

Or, if you are not coherent, someone else will choose when you will die, probably down to the day.

Racism does not work the way you think it does.  Lots of very racist people have token friends of other races.  It just reinforces their feelings of empowerment knowing that they are backed up by a majority race.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (910)What We've Learned About Interviewing Engineers  by  zackbloomin  programming[+]codeonfire 13 points14 points15 points 21 days ago  (0 children)[–]codeonfire 13 points14 points15 points 21 days agoHere's how I interview managers:

I request a meeting with the hiring manager BEFORE I agree to do any tech interview.
Does the manager know anything at all...anything...about software development?  How full of shit is this person? Really full of shit?  Then no tech interviews.  We've both wasted 30 minutes instead of only me and some developers wasting 8 hours combined.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (258)Resume transitioning from student to software engineer  by  doubledecker73in  cscareerquestions[+]codeonfire 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]codeonfire 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoAfter starting a first job I would remove any stuff about classes.  I would keep stuff about school projects until I have enough about professional projects to replace it and fill at least a page.  The projects need to be something of professional level though.  It shouldn't be something that makes you look amateur.  You shouldn't write things like 'Set up a web form for my web dev class.'  It should be more like 'set up an example billing system using X technologies.'  People with enough professional projects eventually remove almost all education at some point.
Internships are always relevant.  Extracurriculars are not unless you organized something and it was related to the job you're applying to.  Example: 'organized and lead 5 ACM events with attendance of 20+' but not 'Organized and lead team in amateur hockey league.'  The exception is if the hiring manager plays hockey and you want to work for someone who cares more about shared personal interests than technical interests and abilities.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1)Is it worth transferring and giving up music to go to a better CS school?  by  doanianin  cscareerquestions[+]codeonfire -1 points0 points1 point 1 month ago* (0 children)[–]codeonfire -1 points0 points1 point 1 month ago*Yes, transfer.  People who go to college to pursue hobbies waste their time and money.  Music of the type that is taught at a university pays zero in life.  If you want to perform in an orchestra in your free time, I don't think you need to study music at a college.  You want to transfer as soon as possible since whatever new school will try to make you repeat all the courses you completed at UNT.  Waiting two years is going to cost thousands of dollars and months of time.  If you really want a BA in music and don't care about money then finish the CS completely first, then do the music program.  It should take the same amount of time but you will have the first degree at year 4 instead of year 5 or 6.
