(Taken from r/Nfl)  by  Mightymaasin  soccer[+]TheatreOfDreams 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours ago  (0 children)[–]TheatreOfDreams 0 points1 point2 points 7 hours agoFair enough. But feel as if Essien under Mourinho in Chelsea was an equal if not more invaluable.

What struck me the most is how small the field is when you're standing level. On TV it looks so much bigger, but when you're standing on it, it looks like just an ordinary pitch with amazing grass. Almost makes you think you'd be able to play on something like it.

(Taken from r/Nfl)  by  Mightymaasin  soccer[+]TheatreOfDreams 2 points3 points4 points 13 hours ago  (0 children)[–]TheatreOfDreams 2 points3 points4 points 13 hours agoI don't count Essien as a "could have been". He's a well established player, during his time at Chelsea many would agree that he was the best CM in the league or at least top 5 in his position. Perhaps behind Drogba, but the most talented African footballer this decade.

I think the point Berzerkerz and yourself are arguing over is not whether or not something is cyclical in nature. But that 10 years time is not enough for the cycle. 
Like you said, everything in business runs in cycles, there will be a day when Apple's stock is worth less than the money it's printed on, but that day won't be in 10 years (probably) in the same way the EPL won't have it's downfall in the next 10 years either. Empires rise and fall, but you're making it sound as if it's coming around the corner.

I believe Germany and Belgium as of right now, have equal if not better players under the age of 23~24.
