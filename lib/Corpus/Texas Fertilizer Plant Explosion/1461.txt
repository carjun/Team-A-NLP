I'd rather not have watched it just before bed.
The worse part is the dad can't reassure him because he can't hear the kid and vice versa.

This. Her voice is so chillingly terrified. I just want to jump into the video and tell her everything will be okay and make her feel safe.

You'll notice he doesn't respond to the kid.

permalinksaveparent[+]monkeytoes77 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago  (0 children)[–]monkeytoes77 0 points1 point2 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onThe most touching thing to me is that the father, though probably panicking himself, keeps it together for the kid.

That kid experienced some serious trauma. I guess the thrill of being so close to the fire was undeniable for the father.

We all have them -- you're going along ask "this is pretty cool"-like and then you realize you almost just died, and you had no idea you were in danger.
