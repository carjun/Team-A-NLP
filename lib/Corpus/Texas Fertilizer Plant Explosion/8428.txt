Rules
If you believe a post should be removed, please report it and message the mods as to why it was reported.

As often as possible, moderators will rely on reports to judge which content the community wishes to see removed. If unreported content is removed, there's a good reason for it.

Trolls and their posts will also be left to the community to deal with as much as possible. If a user continues to post such content, or is reported to the mods by the community, warnings and/or bans will be instituted where necessary.

Anything violating reddit's Terms of Service will be removed without warning.

Users who continually or excessively defy these rules will be banned.
