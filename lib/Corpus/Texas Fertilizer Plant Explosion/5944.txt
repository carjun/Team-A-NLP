If the name does not match exactly but is “substantially similar” to the name on the OLRV, the voter will be permitted to vote as long as the voter signs an affidavit stating that the voter is the same person on the list of registered voters.
If a voter does not have proper identification, the voter will still be permitted to vote provisionally. The voter will have (six) 6 days to present proper identification to the county voter registrar, or the voter’s ballot will be rejected.
[...]
Affidavits are available for voters who have a consistent religious objection to being photographed and for voters who do not have any photo identification as a result of certain natural disasters as declared by the President of the United States or the Texas Governor within 45 days of the day the ballot was cast.

But frankly... this isn't local news. When americans enunciate spanish words just because they look 'spanish'; it sounds terrible. In the real world, spanglish works really well because typically both parties are comaparably educated and they don't teach you the really hard words in 6th grade. Luckily, you can reasonably infer that the person you're talking to knows where you're going with it all, and if that doesn't work... we can switch to alcohol. Historically this works really well. Mexicans even have this really badass shit made of distilled agave, but we don't have a word for it in english... I'm very sorry to say...

My idea was more about unity. I said hi to every person with a flag, Jersey, and chavo del ocho shirt. I've heard mexicans say d.f.eños and people from monterrey are snobs... in some cases that's true. This ain't mexico: so you can leave all that shit at home. La reconquista goes both ways yo!
