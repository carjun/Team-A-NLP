Single version of 'I Dream Of Christmas' by Anita Dobson with Brian May on guitar, synthesizers and backing vocals, and John Deacon on bass. Released only on the 'I Dream Of Christmas' single in 1988. Also produced by Brian May. Brian wrote two Christmas songs in 1983 intended for Queen, this one, and Thank God It's Christmas (written with Roger Taylor) with the band choosing the latter as their release. Brian then resurrected this track 4 years later during the Talking Of Love sessions.Lyrics:I sit alone by the firesideAnd watch the old year passing byDown the street they're singing party songsYou know Christmas always makes me cryI dream of ChristmasI dream of ChristmasMaybe my dreams will come trueI dream of ChristmasA merry ChristmasI dream of Christmas and youAnd so tonight my thoughts are reaching outThough you're a million miles awayMy dream is strong enough to see me throughOur love's forever and a dayI dream of ChristmasI dream of ChristmasMaybe my dreams will come trueI dream of ChristmasA merry ChristmasI dream of Christmas and youAnd once again the world is filled with joyI want to share it far and wideYour spirit fills the air and comforts meI know you're always by my sideI dream of ChristmasI dream of ChristmasMaybe my dreams will come trueI dream of ChristmasA merry ChristmasI dream of Christmas and youI dream of Christmas and youI dream of ChristmasI dream of ChristmasI dream of ChristmasI dream of ChristmasI dream of Christmas------------------------------------- "Queen" "Freddie Mercury" "Brian May" "Roger Taylor" "John Deacon" "Keep Yourself Alive" "Queen II" "Seven Seas of Rhye" Sheer Heart Attack" Killer Queen" "Now I'm Here" "A Night at the Opera" "Bohemian Rhapsody" "You're My Best Friend" "A Day At The Races" "Somebody To Love" "Tie Your Mother Down" "Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy" "News Of The World" We Will Rock You" We Are The Champions" "Spread Your Wings" "Jazz" "Bicycle Race" "Don't Stop Me Now" "Fat Bottomed Girls" "Live Killers" "Love Of My Life" "The Game" "Play The Game" "Save Me" "Another One Bites The Dust" "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" "Flash Gordon" "Flash" "The Hero" "Hot Space" "Body Language" "Under Pressure" "Las Palabras De Amor" "The Works" "The Complete Works" "Radio Ga Ga" "I Want To Break Free" "It's A Hard Life" "Hammer To Fall" "A Kind Of Magic" "One Vision" "Who Wants To Live Forever" "Friends Will Be Friends" "The Miracle" "Breakthru" "Scandal" "I Want It All" "The Invisible Man" "Innuendo" "I'm Going Slightly Mad" "These Are The Days of our Lives" "The Show Must Go On" "Headlong" "Live at Wembley" "At The Beeb" "Classic Queen" "Made In Heaven" "Heaven for Everyone" "Mother Love" "Too Much Love Will Kill You" "I Was Born To Love You" You Don't Fool Me" A Winter's Tale" "Queen + Paul Rodgers" "Greatest Hits" "Greatest Hits II" "Greatest Hits III" Queen Rocks" "Queen Rock Montreal" "Stone Cold Classics" "Queen on Fire Live at the Bowl" "Return of the Champions" "Larry Lurex" "The Cross" "The Eye" "Ibex" "Wreckage" "We Will Rock You The Musical" "WWRY"
