Abortion is a personal issue, NOT a government one.

permalinksave[+]learn2die101 20 points21 points22 points 2 days ago  (4 children)[–]learn2die101 20 points21 points22 points 2 days agoI disagree. Medical procedures should be governmentally regulated to given medical standards. That's kind of half the idea behind legal abortions.
The issue here is that the standards set are not medical standards, they are legislative standards, which is where it diverges from every other procedure which takes place in the state of Texas.

permalinksaveparent[+]theTANbananas 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]theTANbananas 5 points6 points7 points 2 days agoMaybe when it comes to standards and regulations. MAYBE. But they should not be involved in saying what you can and cant do, nor should they fund it in any way.

permalinksaveparent[+]darkenedsky 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]darkenedsky 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoYou're right. I guess what I meant is it's not up to the government to make that decision for someone else. I feel like they try to put too many restrictions on abortion just because they don't like it. The ultrasounds, the waiting periods, etc. I don't think it's their right to make it that hard for a woman to get a pretty safe procedure done.

Hopefully this will result with the burdensome regulations being cut out (admitting privileges/ mifepristone restriction) while keeping the reasonable 20 week ban in place. 

permalinksave[+]mariahmce 50 points51 points52 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]mariahmce 50 points51 points52 points 2 days agoAs someone who is pregnant now, I can confirm. I'm 35 and am getting comprehensive genetic testing done one the baby which can't be performed until 10 weeks. However only folks with a family history of genetic defects or ladies over 35 (like me) usually get this. The genetic testing uncovers things like chromosomal abnormalities. 
Anomaly scans aren't done until 19-21 weeks. The baby is just too small to pick up any major physical anomalies until then. The anomaly scan would pick up things like: absence of the top of the head (anencephaly), excess fluid within the brain (hydrocephalus), missing, defective or misplaced major organs, missing limbs, spina bifida, Etc. So basically the 20 week law lets women end pregnancies because of choice or genetic defect (if they are eligible for that testing) but won't let a woman end a non-viable physically defective pregnancy. 
I think making a woman carry a non-viable pregnancy to full term is extremely cruel. Some women might choose to, but most would not. 

permalinksaveparent[+]bearsinthesea 16 points17 points18 points 2 days ago  (16 children)[–]bearsinthesea 16 points17 points18 points 2 days agoWhy is this downvoted so hard? Am I missing something? It sounds like an on-topic opinion. 
Is it becuase apm supports the 20 week thing?

permalinksaveparent[+]learn2die101 13 points14 points15 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]learn2die101 13 points14 points15 points 2 days agoIt appears that way. I do have to disagree with apm and agree with the point made by /u/mariahmce. Birth defects are often difficult to spot at the 20 week mark.

Yes.  Didn't you hear?  It means you're a misogynist woman-hater if you do.  The only women's rights issue that matters anymore is abortion, so don't you dare go against the collective.

permalinksaveparent[+]Moleculor 28 points29 points30 points 2 days ago  (2 children)[–]Moleculor 28 points29 points30 points 2 days agoNo, it's because supporting the 20 week ban is absurd for the reasons explained.

permalinksaveparent[+]RKobalt  comment score below threshold  (1 child)[–]RKobalt -12 points-11 points-10 points 2 days agoCorrect.  It's based on bad science.
But it doesn't matter.  apm193 is automatically a woman-hater for saying 20 instead of 24.  And therefore we must downvote him.

Or maybe that was just you using those terms.

I'm tired of people tallying downvotes and extrapolating them into some sort of horrific persecution of dissent. I get plenty of downvotes myself, particularly in /r/Texas threads regarding politics. Grow a spine.

permalinksaveparent[+]Vee_Vee 32 points33 points34 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]Vee_Vee 32 points33 points34 points 2 days agoNothing reasonable about that either:
"comprehensive fetal testing, such as anatomical sonograms and ultrasounds of the heart, are typically performed just before 20 weeks of gestation. Such scans are critical for uncovering major birth defects, such as anencephaly (severe brain malformations), major heart defects, missing organs and limbs, and other severe birth defects. Fetal development is a complex process that often goes awry. Roughly 2 percent of all pregnancies are complicated by a major birth defect, and of those about 0.5 percent have a chromosomal defect, such as an extra or missing segment of normal DNA. Birth defects are a leading cause of infant mortality, and in many cases of severe birth defects, no medical treatment can salvage a fetus’s life or result in any measure of normal future health."   
Post-20 week abortions are not a matter of convienience, and actually rarely evne occur, but sometimes they are necessary.

permalinksaveparent[+]lethal1ty 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]lethal1ty 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoWhile I understand people thinking the 20 week ban is reasonable, I disagree. Many problems that turn a pregnancy harmful to the child and the mother develop after 20 weeks.

permalinksaveparent[+]sangjmoon  comment score below threshold  (24 children)[–]sangjmoon -24 points-23 points-22 points 2 days agoWhat is interesting is that besides the labor unions, Planned Parenthood is the biggest out of state donor for Wendy Davis. This is while they are throwing their own clinics under the bus saying that Texas laws are forcing them to close because they don't have the money to stay open. Planned Parenthood is choosing to make Texas a battleground for abortion, and they'll be as disingenuous and devious as needed to win.

permalinksave[+]troydm 16 points17 points18 points 2 days ago  (13 children)[–]troydm 16 points17 points18 points 2 days agoPP isn't throwing anything under the bus.  From the article:

The former [the provision requiring physicians to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where the abortion is performed], the suit says, would force the closure of [more] than a third of the state's abortion facilities, including the only provider in Lubbock, Waco, Killeen, Harlingen and McAllen, and all three in Fort Worth, partly because of distance, partly because of the refusal of many hospitals to grant admitting privileges to abortion providers. 

I don't see how throwing money at the clinics solves anything.  

permalinksaveparent[+]sangjmoon  comment score below threshold  (12 children)[–]sangjmoon -32 points-31 points-30 points 2 days agoI guess they can't relocate. I guess there are no hospitals that will grant admitting privileges. No. There is no reason Planned Parenthood couldn't have the same number of clinics and more. Planned Parenthood wants this showdown, and they'll garner as much false sympathy they need to get what they want.

It's a weak tactic that shows he's run out of proper arguments, if he had any to begin with.

I guess there are no hospitals that will grant admitting privileges.

In Lubbock, Waco, Killeen, Harlingen and McAllen? No, there aren't, Einstein.
I suppose they could relocate to Houston, Austin, or Dallas, where there are already providers that will still be around after this crap legislation takes effect. 
If that 14-year-old girl carrying her stepfather's child has to steal a car and drive eight hours to a clinic, them's just the breaks, right?

permalinksaveparent[+]sangjmoon  comment score below threshold  (1 child)[–]sangjmoon -10 points-9 points-8 points 2 days agoNo. If you ask the hospitals, they will not say they deny admitting privileges because of abortion. However, to get admitting privileges, you usually have to apply to become part of the staff of the hospital, and that is a lengthy and rigorous process that relatively few doctors pass. If you are careful about your doctor, making sure your doctor has admitting privileges means that he/she went through an extra layer of screening that most doctors don't go through. Also, unfortunately, admitting privileges also become an economic pawn for the hospitals. They will use it to make exclusionary contracts of financial benefit for the hospital. It isn't impossible for abortion doctors to get admitting privileges, but if they don't, you probably wouldn't want to go to that doctor anyway.

permalinksaveparent[+]natophonic2 14 points15 points16 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]natophonic2 14 points15 points16 points 2 days agoA doctor who performs abortions is not going to get admitting privs at any hospital run by Catholics or any other religious organization with similar views. In many towns and rural areas in Texas, the only local hospitals are ones run by such organizations. And the people who wrote the legislation know this. 
In the case of municipal hospitals in conservative areas...

they will not say they deny admitting privileges because of abortion

... but they deny doctors admitting priviledges because of abortion.

In Lubbock, Waco, Killeen, Harlingen and McAllen?

Wait, what? All those places have hospitals. Harlingen has an abortion clinic not very from from the nearest hospital, and probably all those other cities do too. Not sure what you're getting at with that.

permalinksaveparent[+]Moleculor 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago  (3 children)[–]Moleculor 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoNot ones that are within the law's distance or admitting requirements. They could have a hospital right next door, but a if a hospital doesn't let them in the doors, they have to shut down. 
Also, there's no medical reason for the admitting requirements. Even the state medical board thinks it's an unnecessary requirement. 

permalinksaveparent[+]mutatronborn and bred -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days ago  (2 children)[–]mutatronborn and bred -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days agoI also think it's unnecessary, but there are hospitals in those cities and they are close to the clinics. Look it up on google maps.

permalinksaveparent[+]Moleculor 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]Moleculor 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoThey could have seven hospitals nearby, it still wouldn't let them stay open unless they had admitting privileges at one close enough. They didn't shut down clinics for the hell of it, they shut down because they were legally required to do so.

permalinksaveparent[+]mutatronborn and bred 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]mutatronborn and bred 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoActual evidence is always better than hand waving, and it's also easy to find these days. Here's an article that supports what you're saying:

The two hospitals where Minto might apply for admitting privileges, one in Harlingen and one in Brownsville, operate under Valley Baptist Health System — a system with religious affiliation. Minto said he does not anticipate being granted admitting privileges there for that reason. He said doing so might also jeopardize the funding for the hospital.


permalinksaveparent[+]SpacedAlien 26 points27 points28 points 2 days ago  (9 children)[–]SpacedAlien 26 points27 points28 points 2 days agoThe Governor and the state legislature are the ones who've turned Texas into a battleground for abortion.  Planned parenthood is just reacting to their big government regulations.

If the law hadn't been passed, there would be no lawsuit.  Claiming that this is PP's fault is beyond ridiculous.

permalinksaveparent[+]handsomesteve88  comment score below threshold  (2 children)[–]handsomesteve88 -6 points-5 points-4 points 2 days agoRoe v. Wade held that a state may regulate abortions after the 1st trimester.  The first trimester ends at week 12.  

permalinksaveparent[+]SpacedAlien 10 points11 points12 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]SpacedAlien 10 points11 points12 points 2 days agoI was referring to the ridiculous demands placed on clinics' proximities to hospitals and the methods used in medication abortions, which are the 2 provisions being challenged in the lawsuit.  The suit makes no reference to the term length at all.

permalinksaveparent[+]Moleculor 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]Moleculor 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoNo. Roe v. Wade held that government may restrict abortions to a period of time just prior to fetal viability.
Fetal viability doesn't even reach coin-toss chances until 24 weeks. 90% viability is around 26 weeks. 
As others have said, most health testing to determine whether anything born will be viable or fully formed can't be done until the 20th week. 
The "first trimester" myth is bullshit, but a common misconception.

However, making sure your next kid isn't born with serious mental retardation or physical birth defects? They take care of that. Making sure mothers don't die giving birth to their third child? They do that too. And they do it cheap, so poor people can afford it.

And there's no way in fucking hell anyone's ever going to convince me that a 32 year old mother of three children should die because some religious nutjob decided that the ball of goo killing her has more of a right to live than some actual kid's mother.

Last session family planning funds were cut and that is causing clinics to close, as many can no longer afford their services.  Not to mention when you are saying they MUST put in a few millions (minimum) into new, unnecessary regulations as HB2 does, and they have to do it within just over a year.  It isn't happening.  Most of the money goes right back into care, financial help for those who can't afford various things, equipment, training, etc.
