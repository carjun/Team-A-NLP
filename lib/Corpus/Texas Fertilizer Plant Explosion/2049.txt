I will always downvote twitter hashtag bullshit on REDDIT. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (78)What are some bands you dismissed, or simply did not like at first... but later won you over?  by  STYLIEin  Music[+]-Travis 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]-Travis 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI have had the reverse effect with this band. When I first heard them they felt different and refreshing and I listened to them quite a bit. My friends were like "Dude, what are we listening to an why are we listening to it?"
After a while I pretty much totally forgot about them...until recently when I heard them played on the local radio station and my first thought was "what did I like about this again?"  I dunno, they just don't do it for me anymore.

Not OMG look at all these toolbars, but full on gore. 
I think there is another sub that would really appreciate this... /r/cablenightmares or something. Maybe someone out there knows what sub I'm talking about because I don't think that's it.

AMA!  by  PornSiteOwnerin  IAmA[+]-Travis 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]-Travis 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI believe the condom law only applies to the greater Los Angeles area and not the state of California as a whole. Still 90% of american porn probably comes outta LA anyway so it might as well be the entire state.  Someone please correct me if I am wrong.

So, you can get Universities and Wats at the same time. They work just as you might dream. It's the most hilarious thing ever. Obviously this is an exploit. A beautiful, beautiful exploit.

Probably more like methhead Martin or something. Deserves its own meme. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1041)Reddit, what is your dream job?  by  cthulululu1in  AskReddit[+]-Travis 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]-Travis 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoOwn/manage my own skate shop. It's weird that my dream job is ultimately retail, but I love skateboarding and the culture that surrounds it. I would love to do something that keeps me connected to it since I'm getting older and don't get to skate much anymore. Unfortunately I have watched probably a dozen small shops come and go in my area in the last decade and I can't wager my family's future on a dream that has little chance of success.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (742)Getting into American Football  by  the-vicious-onein  nfl[+]-Travis 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]-Travis 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoMost regular season NFL games happen simultaneously on Sundays at two different times regardless of west or east coast. The Sunday early games (when majority of games are played) happen at about 10:15 am pacific 1:15  pm east. Then there is the Sunday afternoon game which starts about 1:15 pm pacific, 4:15 pm east. 
Then there are three other games during the week that have no competition with other football games during their timeslot. These games occur on Thursday, Sunday, and Monday nights (not sure exact time but I think around 5:15 pacific/8:15 east).

It's the casualty of there being no quality sports available during the all star break in baseball. 
ESPN has to figure out some way to fill 22 hours of sportscenter while only having tennis and golf to cover.

It was tragic seeing him screaming at his non-repaired leg "you gotta be fucking kidding me!"
