It's definitely not safe in that area right now, especially with the high winds circulating the ammonia. Stay safe.

permalinksaveparent[+]Antartic_Camel 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]Antartic_Camel 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoyeah this front coming thru is not helping with all the chemicals in the air

permalinksaveparent[+]TheEccentricSpeaker 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]TheEccentricSpeaker 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoIt really isn't. Perhaps though, the high winds will circulate the toxic air enough to dissipate their levels so they aren't as dangerous. We can only hope.

permalinksaveparent[+]Antartic_Camel 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]Antartic_Camel 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoyeah if im right the winds are North west tongiht so it shouldnt be to bad. i think Corsicana area would be the area affected if it were to be toxic

permalinksaveparent[+]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoHopefully by now the air isn't as bad. I'm not too common with ammonia nitrate explosions so I'm not exactly sure how the air is affected. I assume that there are fumes/smoke surrounding the area that could be quite potent. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Antartic_Camel 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Antartic_Camel 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoyeah and there is a video of a guy seeing the explosion. then he drives over there right thru a bunch of smoke.

permalinksaveparent[+]oh_rats 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]oh_rats 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoUnless he's south of West. Waco is a safe zone, because we're having super strong N winds. If he's N of West, he needs to GTFO.

permalinksaveparent[+]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI agree, although I read somewhere that the thunderstorms that rolled through today have dissipated most of the fumes from the surrounding area.

permalinksaveparent[+]AnthropomorphicDream 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]AnthropomorphicDream 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI doubt there's much ammonia left after that explosion.
