What sets one instrument aside from another can be so striking and distinct, but so often are the subtly unique differences brushed aside for sake of a quick sale. In 2011 a group of individuals came together under the steadfast helm of a company who takes great pride in their ability to discern and share individual details and tonal characteristics of amazing guitars. The idea that came forth was to be able to created a new way of sharing, learning, and comparing all facets that were to make a guitar special and unique in both its aesthetics and tonality. Through detailed demonstration videos, humorous yet enlightening artist interviews, and captivating performances, the Wildwood Video Team has revolutionized the way that guitars are purchased online. And with each passing day, the desire to bring you, the viewer, the listener, the watcher, the reader, the musician, and the peer, the best and most entertaining buying experience one could hope for!LinksWebsitewww.wildwoodguitars.comYouTubeWildwood GuitarsWe were unable to fetch any YouTube videos at this time.
