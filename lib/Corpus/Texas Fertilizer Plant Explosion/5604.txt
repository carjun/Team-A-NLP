Some of you may have noticed that updates to Reddit News are not as frequent as they once were. It has become increasingly difficult to find time (around a full time job, family and friends) to implement all the features people want to see and have asked for. The purpose of these new permissions is to try and increase ad revenue to a point where i could work on updating Reddit News for a day or two a week.I realize there is (understandable) discontent around these kinds of permissions so i'm making the old version available ad free and permission free for users who don't want to upgrade. You can download it from my Dropbox here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ygwkyha8wxq8qu3/Reddit%20News%20Free%20552.apkYou also have the option to buy the paid version.Also see the following link for a discussion on reddit:http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/173h5q/reddit_news_update_coming_opinion_on_adding/Thanks for listening and cheers! ------------------------------------------------------------A full featured Reddit browser with a user interface fully optimised for touch screens.

We call it the True Card UI.Reddit Illustrated comes with a recommended set of topics that include pics, funny, videos, aww, cats, wallpaper, music, movies and more.
