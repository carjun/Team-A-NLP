I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps I look at the floor and I see it need sweeping Still my guitar gently weeps I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold you love I don't know how someone controlled you they bought and sold you I look at the world and I notice it's turning While my guitar gently weeps With every mistake we must surely be learning Still my guitar gently weeps I don't know how you were diverted you were perverted too I don't know how you were inverted no one alerted you I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping While my guitar gently weeps I look at you all Still my guitar gently weeps Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
