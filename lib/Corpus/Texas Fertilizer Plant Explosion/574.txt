OK So YouTube have un-muted it! Happy Days! :)*READ FIRST*(this is an entirely fictional and is in no way a spoiler for the books)The Final Battle cost Harry and Ron their lives, leaving a devastated Hermione all alone.Overwhelmed with grief, she sees Ron and Harry everywhere she looks. Is it just her imagination, or is she being haunted by more than just memories?Everyone else at Hogwarts is seemingly too caught up in their own grief to notice how she is feeling, or going on like nothing has happened, which makes Hermione angry, as she feels like the worlds stopped turning... and still her grief- stricken mind plays tricks on her, with cruel glimpses of the friends she lost.She assumes she's just seeing what she wants to see... but could there be more to it? Have Ron and Harry really returned to Hogwarts to watch over her..or is there another reason??*OK.. so you really need to watch this one all the way through (I mean literally till the screen goes black)for it to make sense... and even then it might not!!! lol.. but hopefully it will!!!NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED WITH THIS VIDEO!!
