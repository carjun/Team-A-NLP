Lyrics:Sitting in a surgeon's world,as sturgeons will,a surgeon's girl with me.Standing on a river bed,where weeds can be,I'm on my knee,to you.I've seen in glossy mags,I've seen you and you see me (rpt. to infinite possibilities).Said you weren't a tuna fish,put in a tin,they're very big,Ha Ha.I've seen in glossy mags,I've seen you and you see me (rpt. to infinite possibilities).
