One thing about strong winds are that they disperse and mix out plumes so that the concentration is lower.  I've had a look at the HYSPLIT model and while you may smell it, it is not going to kill you. 
Furthermore, the wind will switch to the northwest in 3-4 hours behind a strong front and the plume will head off to the east and southeast. 

permalinksave[+]arasmussen 28 points29 points30 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]arasmussen 28 points29 points30 points 5 months agoHaving basic Hazmat certification, if you can smell it, it's probably causing you damage. Especially with anhydrous ammonia, at just over 100ppm it starts causing a lot of damage. 

permalinksaveparent[+]laminak 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]laminak 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI'm not an expert at what ppm you'd be able to smell it. I didn't want to call the OP a liar, but we were in a low concentration part of the plume of a few ppm last night. 

permalinksaveparent[+]arasmussen 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]arasmussen 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoNeither am I, just basic, but it's still better to be safe than dead from the inhalation. If i knew that even a dispersed amount was coming at me downwind I would most definitely take a road trip for the rest of the day to get upwind

permalinksaveparent[+]I_Am_Thing2 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]I_Am_Thing2 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIn the case of ammonia, you can smell it at much lower ppm's than what will leave permanent damage (we have ammonia safety training at my work). However, this is still a large release, so I cannot vouch for what levels people will come into contact with.
