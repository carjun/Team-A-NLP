"/r/worldpolitics is the largest anarchy on reddit, and a rebellion against the more censored /r/worldnews and /r/politics." - /u/deletecode
"It's like the Mad Max of subreddits." - /u/winkwinknudge_nudge
"It's basically /pol/ but with votes." - /u/Anon49
"I found what's left of the old reddit in r/conspiracy and r/worldpolitics" - /u/Aqua_lung
"Imagine a place with all the mindless sensationalism of /r/politics, all the smug elitism of /r/atheism, and all the nauseating racism of /r/videos. Guess what, a place like this actually exists! And it's called /r/worldpolitics." - /u/Zxccft
