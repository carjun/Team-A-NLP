"We Are Everlasting" is track 2 on 'The Silent Revolution EP.' From Los Angeles, alt-indie-electro band STANDING SHADOWS combine infectious guitar melodies and soundscapes, vintage synth tones and warbles, driving percussive beats, and the intimately emotional vocals...ranging from uber-chill heroin whispers, to heart-pumping, sweat-soaking screams. www.standingshadows.com
