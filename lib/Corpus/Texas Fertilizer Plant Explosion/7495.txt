How many crimes does it take by the age of 19 to be considered a real criminal?

I remember he had a few months of fame back before he went to jail but I haven't heard much of him since.
EDIT: Just curious.
EDIT 2: Someone explain to me why I am being downvoted. I simply asked a question.
EDIT 3: Fuck off. Gucci is trash anyways.

Look on ebay and other sites where people sell used things and get a value based on that. So, no, do not sell the lot of these games to your cheap pal. ;)

permalinksavecontextfull comments (14)[Question]: Should I sell?  by  drfribblesin  pokemontrades[+]UnsexMeHarder 1 point2 points3 points 19 days ago  (0 children)[–]UnsexMeHarder 1 point2 points3 points 19 days agoDepends on the buyer and on the condition of the game. I got Soul Silver used for like $45 a couple months ago. I traded somebody Far Cry 3 ($60) for their Heart Gold, so yeah, I'd say you could easily get that much. (my Soul Silver ended up not working so that kinda sucked)

permalinksavecontextfull comments (22)gun control  by  em-beein  AskReddit[+]UnsexMeHarder 0 points1 point2 points 23 days ago  (0 children)[–]UnsexMeHarder 0 points1 point2 points 23 days agoI think this is the correct response. The prior comments to this question reference statistics from Canada and Europe in favor of more strict gun control. I don't think those stats are completely relevant due to cultural, historical, etc. differences.
I'm most definitely not picking a side in opposition of more gun laws, but I just think the aforementioned statistics are irrelevant.

The Wikipedia entry is a pretty interesting read. Definitely would recommend it if you have never heard of pareidolia before. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia
