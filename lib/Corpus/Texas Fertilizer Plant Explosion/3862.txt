No hysterical screaming, sounding out injuries, and wanting to gtfo out of there.

Not an upset or sad or wanting attention, but truly honestly scared.

It heart wrenching to hear that poor girl cry like that knowing that terror she must be feeling yet  her father and her can't even hear each other!!!! god i hope they're okay

permalinksaveparent[+]Frigidus_Appellatio 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Frigidus_Appellatio 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agosimilar situation, wanted water very bad and begging for it promising to be good, clean room, etc
But since most of the bones in my face were broken and i was on my way to surgery they wouldn't let me have any so my stomach stayed empty. All they would do was flush broken teeth and blood out of my mouth, but it was the back of my throat that needed the moisture.
Anyway the point is, when your a kid in a situation like that you suddenly remember all kinds of manners you don't normally use. First hand experience.

Yeah, probably, pussy. Also, it was a girl. The father calls her Chloe.

Got in a crash as a kid in my parents car, and my mom screamed "put on your seatbelt" as we sat in a ditch afterward.

permalinksaveparent[+]subtlesuicide 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]subtlesuicide 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoUnfortunately, the child was most likely suffering from psychological shock (acute stress reaction). The way she was repeating the same things over and over again indicates that, essentially, her brain was not processing any new information. The apparent politeness and calmness is most likely a side effect of this lack of processing as she would have had no immediate emotional reaction and saying "please" has likely been a strongly reinforced behavior for her.
Sorry to be a downer.

permalinksaveparent[+]OperaSona 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]OperaSona 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI'm not sure about whether not screaming when you can't hear anything shows amazing control or is just a natural reaction.

permalinksaveparent[+]sammynicxox 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]sammynicxox 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoShe was probably in shock a bit too.

permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoHonestly, she was pretty hysterical. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that and anyone would be hysterical after an explosion like that. But she still did seem literally hysterical. We don't have to gloss over that, it doesn't diminish her being there.
