permalinksavecontextfull comments (19245)[Serious] Do you have a reason to keep living? What is it?  by  vardonirin  AskReddit[+]batman9513 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago  (0 children)[–]batman9513 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoWhen a thought about this my main motivation was this: killing yourself is the most selfish act you could ever commit. 
You're leaving behind so many people that are counting on you for whatever reason. Especially your family. You leave them with the burden of taking care of all the things accompany death. 
No matter how you you don't like your parents, or disagree with them or what have you, no parent wants to bury their own child. I will never put my parents through that if I can help it.
