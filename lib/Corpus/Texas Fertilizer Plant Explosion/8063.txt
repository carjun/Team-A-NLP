Welcome to Life Pro Tips!
An LPT is a tip that improves your life in a meaningful way. Share your best tips you've picked up throughout your life!
Rules:

Prefix your submissions with LPT:. If you don't we'll presume you never read the rules, and your post will be subject to removal.
No LPTs about Facebook, Reddit, Bebo, Myspace, Friendster, Geocities, Twitter, or any other social networks (with the exception of LinkedIn).
No medical advice/practicing medicine or hiccup 'cures'.
Don't post LPT "lists" (e.g. 50 Things Every Man Should Know). Additionally, don't post links to long articles.
Refrain from putting profanity in the title (although within the post body is fine).
LPTs that suggest taking illegal action will be removed.
Designate "adult" or non-family friendly tips as NSFW.
No product or service recommendations for their intended use.
Don't post a request for something that can be easily Googled. 
DON'T FORGET TO FLAIR YOUR POST

Tips:

Search before you submit.
Downvote posts you feel aren't LPT worthy and report rule-breaking posts to notify mods.
Submit tips that you have tried and found to be successful.
Keep tips short and concise!
Common sense or common courtesy are NOT pro-tip worthy.
