10 About 60 people remained unaccounted for in the central Texas town of West as of Fri., following an explosion at a fertilizer plant. That will likely raise the death toll from the 12 that have already been confirmed. Several emergency responders were among the dead. About 200 were injured, and 50 buildings were destroyed. Cause of the blast is under investigation.
