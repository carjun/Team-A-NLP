I would like to hear from you.  by  jnlomaxin  houston[+]drewgriz 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours ago  (0 children)[–]drewgriz 2 points3 points4 points 17 hours agoJust playing devil's advocate here; obviously people will try to play the race card when it's not the real reason they weren't let in. But here's the study OP is referring to. Assuming her methodology isn't catastrophically flawed, the disparity is too large to be coincidence. Now you're right that it doesn't mean that Houston doormen are more racist than other major cities (major being an important distinguisher; none of the southern college towns you mentioned are present, but Atlanta is conspicuously low on the list). But, saying that Houston bars are not significantly more racist than those of other cities necessarily implies that ethnic Houstonians are four times more likely to inappropriately play the race card in Yelp reviews. Which seems just as unlikely (but not necessarily more unlikely) than inordinately racist bouncers. And either way, it's something worth looking into further.

I would like to hear from you.  by  jnlomaxin  houston[+]drewgriz 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours ago  (0 children)[–]drewgriz 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours agoJesus yall, I think he's just using it as a starting point, which is why he's asking for people's experiences here, presumably to follow up in a more reliable medium. If he was just writing a "Hey, look what this lady found on Yelp. How about that!"-type article, he wouldn't need any help from us.

And even if the center does trend more to the west, all the main convection and cloud formation so far has been conspicuously concentrated on the east side of the center of rotation, probably due to upper-level westerly wind shear. Whether or not the front gets here in time will determine whether the landfall is more like New Orleans or more like Pensacola.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (5)When does a man get to hear your reason for rejecting him?  by  Anorexicuntin  AskWomen[+]drewgriz 15 points16 points17 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]drewgriz 15 points16 points17 points 3 days agoHere's the other thing, and this applies regardless of who's rejecting whom: 9 times out of 10, even if you do have a single, specific reason, giving this reason is not going to be helpful to the person being rejected. Just because one person doesn't like your sense of humor, or your friends, or your technique in bed, doesn't necessarily mean that's something you need to fix. It just means that's you, and you should find someone who is into you, rather than trying to be someone else to please one person.
For example, if someone is really into you, but they're really into death metal, and you say "Hey, you're pretty cool I guess, but the whole death metal bit is kind of a turn-off," they'll A) feel personally insulted and insecure that you don't like something that's very important to them, and B) feel pressure to change something that's very important to them in order to please you, when in reality they'd be better off finding someone who appreciates that part of their life.

How are you spending the weekend?  by  Always_Has_A_Bonerin  AskMen[+]drewgriz 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]drewgriz 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoTonight: Probably seeing a local country-rock band at a hipster bar. Sue me.
Tomorrow: Watching Miami kick the shit out of Georgia Tech with some other local 'Canes fans, then going to the Greek Festival to eat as much souvlaki and baklava as I possibly can, then going with some friends to watch the Great Gatsby screen on the green at the park downtown, then get some beers after.
Sunday: My buddy is getting us onto the golf course at the country club he works for. Later, going to evening church service followed by BYOB Texans watch party at church.  That part probably won't be pretty. We're playing the 49ers. They're kinda good.
For one of my "free" weekends, I guess it's kinda full.

I think that says more about their scheduling and non-SEC parity than it does about how good those teams are or aren't, but I think you'll start to see "SEC teams beating the snot out of their OOC schedule" as less of a foregone conclusion in the future than it's been the past several years.
