Thanks 
Edit The red cross center could use donations in this area.  If you don't have financial resources to donate could you at least please donate your time and give something free?  Blood is needed at each of these hospitals.  It cost nothing to you but is truely priceless.

permalinksaveparent[+]iamaredditer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]iamaredditer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI do but have not used it in several years.  Maybe just do an online order and set a time of delivery for tomorrow or send me an e card to one of the big three and send it to me through msg and I will find somewhere for it to go tomorrow.  Thanks for your help! 

permalinksaveparent[+]mwolfee 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]mwolfee 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoPizza Hut won't take my credit card (requires US-issued cards) and Domino's ordering system seems to be down, at least from my end. I can get to the main page for Waco, TX Domino's store, but clicking anything (i.e. gift card, order now) will return a 'page unavailable' error.

permalinksaveparent[+]iamaredditer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]iamaredditer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI will look into this tomorrow when the stores are open and try and get back with you.  Thanks!

I don't want to step on toes and flood this with too much information. Have you guys tried setting up something central? IE- one pizza place per location?

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoJust set it up with Dominos. 
Send all calls to the Bell Meade location at 254-799-3030. He will direct orders from there.
Large orders can call him directly at 254-644-0222

permalinksaveparent[+]iamnotevenperturb 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]iamnotevenperturb 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoBeautiful. You're ON it. I sent Aggieland Outfitters and email letting them know that donations are being sent there. Maybe they can help direct the flow of pizzas/give suggestions on where to send them.

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoGood idea, thanks!

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]pm13mum 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoOkay - spoke with Jeff the district manager at Dominos.

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoYes, if an address is listed. There are no formal addresses for the First Baptist Church of Lott or the Providence Health Center.

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]pm13mum 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoUPDATE FROM THE MAYOR OF WEST
This request comes from the Mayor of West. All the goods donated are wonderful but we have received so much, it has become a problem. At this time there are no real material needs for supplies. What will make the BIGGEST affect, is donate money to the relief at Point West Bank & Trust (254) 826-5333 or State National Bank (254) 826-3741.

permalinksaveparent[+]fukmisideways 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]fukmisideways 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoHey all. My women's organization, the Grown Ass Woman Brigade, has a DFW chapter and I know we are trying to organize sending things to the displaced. We're talking about sending out some gift cards for Walmart (or the equivalent) since we know some have lost everything. If we can coordinate with someone more local than DFW, please PM me information.
edit: specified what I meant by local

permalinksave[+]ZephyrSong 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]ZephyrSong 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoHave you tried calling the Waco office of the local Red Cross chapter (I think it's the Heart of Texas chapter)? They'll have the most up-to-date needs list and they should be able to refer you to the nearest collection sites.
Thank you for your help!

permalinksaveparent[+]fukmisideways 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]fukmisideways 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoGreat recommendation!

permalinksave[+]R2Deffyou 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]R2Deffyou 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoVery new to this, never given before. But I absolutely LOVE everything about this and want to be a part of the giving. I read all the rules and guidelines, but am still sort of unsure on the process. Just buy an e-card and order away? Send them to the addresses listed below?

permalinksave[+]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI ordered online at Dominos to be delivered at noon. I just put in their (veterinarian's) address and phone number. 

permalinksaveparent[+]R2Deffyou 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]R2Deffyou 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoOk awesome. Theres so much going on with this, plus me being at work, just trying to figure out the proper addresses and such. Thanks so much!

permalinksave[+]iamnotevenperturb 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]iamnotevenperturb 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoAggieland Outfitters seems to be a good organization to contact. I'll give them a ring and see what we can do.

permalinksave[+]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoDominos
The Bell Meade location is closer to West and that number is  254-799-3030, I have the number for the district manager and owner of those franchises and will update shortly.

permalinksave[+]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoPizza Hut will use three locations:

permalinksave[+]PhiliusTheGreat 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]PhiliusTheGreat 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoI just wanted to say that I believe Hillcrest has moved from the old hospital on Herring. I believe this is the new address: 100 Hillcrest Medical Blvd  Waco, TX 76712

permalinksave[+]iamaredditer[S] 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]iamaredditer[S] 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoWill update thanks.  

permalinksaveparent[+]PhiliusTheGreat 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]PhiliusTheGreat 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoNo problem! My dad used to be a doc out there. He always bitched after they got the new one built, as our house was only about 5 minutes away from the Herring location.

permalinksave[+]GloriousPeanut 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (10 children)[–]GloriousPeanut 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoJust called Bell Meade, they didn't really know what was up... putting in an online order instead!

permalinksave[+]iamaredditer[S] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (8 children)[–]iamaredditer[S] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoLooking into this right now.  Thanks for the heads up.  

permalinksaveparent[+]GloriousPeanut 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (7 children)[–]GloriousPeanut 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoOrdered online for Turner's, order #441123. Hopefully there isn't a problem, I know we used grubhub to deliver pizzas in Boston because the phones were all tied up. Online is probably an easier option for a lot of people, especially since while I was ordering some guys in the office piped up to chip in.

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoOnline will help alleviate some confusion.
Order #352954 to La Vega Veterinary Clinic - we should keep track of this?

permalinksaveparent[+]GloriousPeanut 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]GloriousPeanut 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoAlso a pizza count would be nice - just to keep track of who's received pizza. There probably won't be as huge a response as for Boston, so if everyone donates to the first few addresses some other places may get left out. Wish I could help more but I'm at work, as are likely a lot of people.

permalinksaveparent[+]iamaredditer[S] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]iamaredditer[S] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoAwesome.  Any insight you can bring is much much appreciated.  I just joined this sub yesterday.  

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago* (3 children)[–]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago*I left the window open to follow the online progress and make sure it is delivered.
*It's in the oven!
*Delivered! :)

permalinksaveparent[+]GeorgeInLasVegas 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]GeorgeInLasVegas 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoFor what pizzia place was this for and how easy was it ??? please reply asap?? Im at work .. thank you ..;)

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoDominos - very easy! DominosPizza.com. 
Just enter the address and phone number of the place to deliver to.

permalinksaveparent[+]GeorgeInLasVegas 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]GeorgeInLasVegas 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agogo it!

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]pm13mum 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoReally? Jeff must not have arrived yet. He was heading that way. I put mine in online.

permalinksaveparent[+]OliverTw1st 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago* (1 child)[–]OliverTw1st 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago*I'm a bit confused on the best way to send a donation to a local pizza shop that will just take a credit card and distribute pizza to whoever needs it. I tried calling the Bell Meade Dominos location and they said they weren't accepting donations. 
A big thank you to everyone involved in assisting with relief. You are all amazing and make me so proud to be a part of RAoP. :)

permalinksave[+]iamaredditer[S] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]iamaredditer[S] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoThis has deff been tough but thanks to the awesome people of reddit doing research and finding out what needs to go where as well as coordinating with the different stores seems to have this going relatively well.  Wish we could get some feedback from waco to see if we need to focus in other areas.  I'm at work and thankfully pm13mum has done so much of the leg work.  She's an angel.  I am so thankful I found this sub yesterday after it hit the mainstream media.  

permalinksaveparent[+]sarahbeeswax 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]sarahbeeswax 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoJust sent three pizzas from Dominos to Blair Cove Apartments.  The Dominos that delivers there is the Baylor location (254.753.0131).
They also said their biggest needs at Blair Cove Apartments are undergarments, socks, laundry soap, and towels.
Edit: Grammar.

permalinksave[+]iamaredditer[S] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]iamaredditer[S] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoThanks added to OP. 

permalinksaveparent[+]dmf95742 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]dmf95742 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoWhat did you say when you asked to send pizzas to them? I called and asked on the phone... and they basically said they didn't know what they could do because they don't know anyone there...

permalinksaveparent[+]sarahbeeswax 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]sarahbeeswax 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoActually, they misunderstood and thought I was ordering for myself. I got a call asking me to come sign the receipt. But I told them I was a few hours away and it was a gift.
Either purchase an eGift card for the pizza company and pay online using that, or ask to speak to a manager and explain to them.

permalinksaveparent[+]GeorgeInLasVegas 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]GeorgeInLasVegas 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoCan I get updates via home email? 

permalinksave[+]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]pm13mum 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI am getting an update of places that may need help with food tomorrow. I will post when I know more. 
Thanks iamaredditer for taking the lead and getting this done!

permalinksave[+]iamaredditer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]iamaredditer[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoNo problem I also linked with http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/1cm3lw/does_anyone_know_how_to_donate_to_texas_like_we/
Between the two subs it should be smoother.  Do you think that maybe we should just donate to the pizza places and let them deliver where seen best fit?  Thanks again for everything you made possible.  

permalinksaveparent[+]pm13mum 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]pm13mum 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI have a list of places that are not part of the "official" staging and rescue area so they are not receiving aid.
