Rules

No politics. Political videos (including ones related to current political figures) should be submitted to r/politics, r/worldpolitics, etc.
No personal information such as names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this a warning.
No witch-hunting or incitement to witch hunt. This means no demanding "Reddit justice" in any way in post titles or comments.
No police brutality/violence videos. Consider posting to a different subreddit, like /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut or elsewhere.
No blogspam or URL shorteners. Please post direct links.
No porn or gore. There are many other subreddits for such content.
No DAE posts or solicitation of votes or views.

If your submission does not appear in the new queue, please contact us (be sure to include a link to the Reddit post (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.
Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly!

permalinksaveparent[+]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThe high school is a half mile down the road. I'm not sure if that was a joke because of the damage or not, but it was just a high school when I was there 7 years ago.

permalinksaveparent[+]TrentGoToBed -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]TrentGoToBed -1 points0 points1 point 5 months agoNot a joke,  in 2000 they opened the new high school and the middle school became the intermediate,  and the high school became the middle. But since you said 7 years,  that would be the new high school.

Yes, there is a middle school and track field directly across the tracks from the fertilizer plant. I did forget about that.
