Lyrics:The time is too shortbut never too longto reach ahead,to project the image,which will in time become a concrete dream.Another cigarette,another day,from A to B,again avoiding C, D, and E,'cause E is where you play the blues.Avoiding a deathis to win the game,to avoid relegation,the big E.Drowning in the big swim,rising to the surfaceThe smell of youThat's the lowdown
