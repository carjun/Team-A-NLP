So you can adjust seat post height on the fly.  Here's a video of how it works.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1864)Fertilizer plant just exploded near Waco Texas.  by  Shibbylooin  worldnews[+]jhans22 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]jhans22 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoYou are more than likely correct in your assumption.  Most, if not all, fire departments do pre-incident or pre-fire safety plans that include an assessment of buildings, factories, etc. that pose a unique set of hazards in their response area.  These will include internal building layouts, vehicle access for large structures and accompanying hydrant connections, materials commonly found in the building (Battalion Commanders usually have this information on the fly when incidents go down at places like this) and how you go about putting them out in a fire (i.e. sodium or potassium and water don't play nice).  The local department has probably been to that facility a lot and trained for a situation just like this.  Safety is key, and initial scene size ups are there to attempt to quantify the likelihood of preserving it for yourself, your crew, and the public.  The complexities that go in to determining what to do and how close to get are decisions that are made based on what you know from experience, pre-planning, current conditions, etc.  Information can lag, A LOT, in emergency situations, and may only reach you once you've passed the point of no return.  Planning only takes you so far in situations and in some cases everything is done correctly but first responders still die.  That is the reality of the job.  I hope they all made it out, but if not, I hope they went quickly and beside their brothers and sisters.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (139)2013 Reddit Jersey - Survey Time!  by  aggieotisin  bicycling[+]jhans22 1 point2 points3 points 12 months ago  (0 children)[–]jhans22 1 point2 points3 points 12 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onThis will probably get down voted but I'll state the case anyway.  From what I can tell this is a 'jersey competition' not a 'kit competition'.  What I see right now, barring potential voting inconsistencies, is a kit submission with a 5% lead over everyone else's jersey submissions.  When people vote here they may be thinking that one design may yield more products than the other.  That isn't necessarily the case, and I think we may be seeing different results if the community were only voting on 'jersey designs' or 'kit designs' not a combination of both.  In my opinion, we are now stepping outside of voting based on design aesthetic, and are now voting on what a designer can offer on a product line scale.  That wouldn't be a problem if the guidelines stated that clearly but they didn't.  Those are my 2 cents.
