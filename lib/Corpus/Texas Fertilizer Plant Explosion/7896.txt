A place for everything watercolor!
Submit your current paintings, give and receive critiques. Post resources such as tutorials, ask questions, learn about and  the art of watercolor! 

Posting Guidelines:
1) Posts must be related to watercolor in some way. This means original paintings, questions about works in progress, questions about paper or brushes, other artists etc. Anything related. Mixed media is welcome, as long as watercolor is also used.
2) You must differentiate what is not original content. Most submissions are OC, so if it is NOT original content, please put “Artist: (the artists name)” in the title. It is not okay to ambiguously present other people’s work as your own. We would love to be inspired by other watercolorists on the web, as long as we know it’s not you. It is also extra nice to provide a link in the comments to their website.
3) Do not use this sub for self-promotion or selling pieces. /r/artstore is perfect for that. If someone asks if a piece is for sale in the comments, that’s fantastic. Just don’t post for the sake of advertising that it’s for sale.
4) Try to keep blogs, tumblrs, deviantart accounts and personal websites to a minimum, and only post them if you are looking for feedback or critique. If you are using this site to shamelessly self-promote yourself or anyone, your post will be removed as spam. Yes, it is gray area, so please use your best judgment.
