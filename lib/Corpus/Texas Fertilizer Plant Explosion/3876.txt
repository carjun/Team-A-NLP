It really was one of my buddies, I haven't painted in years, he just doesn't get on reddit. I appreciate it nonetheless!

He decided Rainbow Road would be perfect. Every star in the painting represents some aspect of his life, whether its school, personality, etc. I thought it was an interesting take

I thought that was interesting and have been trying to figure them all out. 
Edit: I think that one's a bowtie though after looking at it closer. One of his favorite people was a bowtie wearing school president haha

permalinksavecontextfull comments (9438)Want a Fishing Kayak, Need Advice  by  Alcoholic_Satanin  Fishing[+]TrentTrentTrent 1 point2 points3 points 2 months ago  (0 children)[–]TrentTrentTrent 1 point2 points3 points 2 months agoIf you're willing to spend money look for a used (2010 and forward) Hobie. As one who owns a Hobie Adventure to fish offshore, it's a sweet kayak. Recently I just finished making a rocket launcher (set of 5 different rod holders) on the back out of PVC pipe for cheap. It fits into my back two rod holders on the kayak and really frees up space. If you google them, you can get great ideas. If you're looking for a good starter, paddle kayak look into the Malibu kayaks either the Xfactor or Extreme. Also, Jackson makes GREAT paddle kayaks but they can be pricey as well.
tl;dr Hobie is the best on the market, followed by Jackson. Malibu and Ocean are great starter kayak brands as well.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (3)Favorite fishing spot in Texas  by  TrentTrentTrentin  Fishing[+]TrentTrentTrent[S] 2 points3 points4 points 3 months ago  (0 children)[–]TrentTrentTrent[S] 2 points3 points4 points 3 months agoWhen we go, we usually go for trout and reds. Every trout down there has been 18"+ they're massive right now. The reds didn't bite this time though so we caught our limits of trout each day and then chased the schools of black drum that usually appear. I'd say it's definitely worth it, you'll want to go with a guide first time out though for sure.

Go on an annual trip down to the lower Laguna Madre since we're further north and usually just fish the upper coast of Texas

Went down to Freeport, Tx this morning trolling lures about 2.5 miles out. He actually had just bought a new Hobie so he wanted to test it out today, so it was a perfect time to test it. The fish its self we measured right at 50in, but didn't get a weight sadly. The three of us guesstimated it to be around 40-50lbs, it was definitely the biggest we've caught. I'm pretty sure he was using a rattle trap and sadly it was the only fish we caught today, we're going to try to head to Corpus Christi sometime this week to see if we can get into some snapper and ling.

Anytime there are people they either don't have a clue or are curious to what we catch, so I never worry too much about hooking a shark with them around.
