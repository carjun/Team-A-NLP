In other words it's kinda like "deterioration" or "degradation" when used outside of physics.  I think what the bishop was getting at is that society's morals are decaying (which is of course a common belief in mormonism).  He doesn't really get that across when he says "So you don't believe in entropy then..." though.
Edit: changed "chaos" and "randomness" to "deterioration" and "degradation" which make more sense in this setting.

Edit: Just finished reading the last part.  /u/tonusbonus, you're a goddamned hero.  Here's some of my favorite lines:

B Where were the prophets when… before the germ theory was proven...? T You're telling me that prophets don't know anything about science, and I agree with you there...that’s my point, not yours…
B: No I think that… you… You’re … gonna look at it that way… as a scientist that you think you are…
T: Well... I'll be honest... I wanted to have sex. Is what I wanted...
B: You weren't alma the younger!

Good god, this was a fantastic read through and through.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (966)TIL on September 11, 1857, a wagon train heading through Utah toward California was attacked by a Mormon Militia. The militia had disguised themselves as Indians, but once it was suspected that their cover was blown, the Mormons feigned a truce and slaughtered 120 men, women, and children.  by  TheCannonin  todayilearned[+]shmameron 5 points6 points7 points 18 hours ago  (0 children)[–]shmameron 5 points6 points7 points 18 hours agoOf course you would say not to trust Wikipedia. To Mormons, any information that paints the church in a bad light is wrong and from the devil, even if it's historical fact.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1373)Regarding death  by  Guardian_452in  TrueAtheism[+]shmameron 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago  (0 children)[–]shmameron 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoIt's natural to be afraid of death. We've evolved that way. Personally I don't worry about it, because it's not like you'll be experiencing nothing, you just won't exist. And honestly it's somewhat comforting to know that nothing I do really matters in the end, because the time will come when none of us will exist.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (31)Anybody heard of someone who resigned or got excommunicated while the were alive, then got Baptized for the dead, after they died?  by  hear2fearin  exmormon[+]shmameron 9 points10 points11 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]shmameron 9 points10 points11 points 1 day agoWell think about it from her perspective. She wants to be with her father forever, and she's willing to baptize him because now that he's in the spirit world, he's accepted the gospel.
This is of course disrespectful to his memory, because it makes him someone he's not. But you wouldn't think that if you believed that he was now a faithful Mormon in the afterlife.
We don't agree with most things Mormons do, but their actions can often be understood when you put yourself in their worldview.
