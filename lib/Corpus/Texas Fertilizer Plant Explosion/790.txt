The goliath grouper off the Southwest Florida shoreline are monsters — up to 8 feet long and 1,000 pounds. They're also federally protected, so you can't just go out and hook yourself one and drag it home in your boat. But take a trip out with a charter captain who participates in the tag-and-release research program, and you can find out for yourself what it's like to fish for these giants. #LoveFL
