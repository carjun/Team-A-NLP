edit: I'm a fucking health professional, I should know these things. Vodka is bad, kids. Further research shows that it's a physical anomaly that isn't bad, but can increase your chances of infection if you try to snort things and shoot them out your tear ducts.

permalinksaveparent[+]aveygt 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]aveygt 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoits a fertilizer factory, where as most people probably know that fertilizer can be used to make bombs bigger, they don't readily think of it as something that explodes which was probably this guys mindset. 
and thats also probably why so many people got hurt. everybody knows to run away when the rocket fuel factory catches on fire.   

permalinksaveparent[+]Stark5 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Stark5 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoWell then that falls on the local authority not this Dad. They saw an impressive fire, and it is not clear just from the video if the father knew it was a fertilizer plant, nor can we assume he had any idea what danger it could have posed.

permalinksaveparent[+]PosiedonPwns 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]PosiedonPwns 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI know bombs are quite a bit louder then guns, but I know a few people that have lost their hearing temporarily from gunshots. The kid seemed to be responding to his/her father, so I would think he should be able to make a good recovery, especially at that age. That being said there could definitely be long term problems if the explosion ruptured one or both of his/her eardrums.

permalinksaveparent[+]thedeepfriedboot 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]thedeepfriedboot 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoThe problem here is not just how loud the sound was, but the pressure of the shock wave that would have followed. While gunshots are loud, they do not cause a high PSI (or kPa) rise in air pressure shock-wave (excluding inside or right beside the gun). The sudden pressure change from the blast would have been massive and would have easily punctured ear drums. If windows were being broken miles away, I could hardly imagine what the pressure of being just a few hundred feet away would have been like. 

permalinksaveparent[+]andg5thou 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]andg5thou 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoperforated ear drums aren't a problem. Loss of hair cells in the cochlea is what causes permanent sensorineural deafness.

permalinksaveparent[+]PosiedonPwns 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]PosiedonPwns 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI was really just using the gunshots as an example of a temporary hearing loss not being permanent. I haven't read about any firefighters experiencing any hearing loss, and this kid was farther away then them. I doubt we will ever know what happens to that kid. I hope for the best for him though. 

permalinksaveparent[+]mutilatedrabbit 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]mutilatedrabbit 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoyou aren't really making any sense. air pressure in a longitudinal sound wave IS amplitude, which is a determinant in loudness.

permalinksaveparent[+]eawsound 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago* (0 children)[–]eawsound 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago*Permanent hearing damage from gunshots is incredibly common.
Once you damage the hair cells in your cochlea they do not grow back or repair themselves no matter your age. When the cells get damaged, the others in the immediate area around the damaged cells start picking up the slack, which wears the healthy cells down faster.  So you may not notice a huge change in hearing after being exposed to a gunshot, but over time the damage will become more pronounced even if you do not shoot guns again. 

permalinksaveparent[+]derping 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]derping 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agounfortunately loss of hearing is usually permanent, she probably didn't lose all her hearing, but some for sure

permalinksaveparent[+]SgtOddball 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]SgtOddball 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoSome loss is always permanent. Once one of the "hair" cells in your cochlea dies, it's dead for good. The kid will probably regain most of their hearing, but it'll never be what it was.

permalinksaveparent[+]robspeaks 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]robspeaks 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoTalking out of my ass here, but I'd think the fact she didn't seem to be in pain is a good sign.

permalinksaveparent[+]thedeepfriedboot 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]thedeepfriedboot 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoOne would hope. Shock and adrenaline really mute things such as pain though when your only instinct is to get away. Lets hope those people and everyone else involved with this explosion are able to quickly recover to whatever extent they can.
