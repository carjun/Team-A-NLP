However, that being said i think the multiplayer was really unique for a first person shooter. I personally had a ton of fun in it, calling down phosporus bombs and then watching it blow up was really cool i thought.

(x-post from /r/toronto)  by  devastatrin  JusticePorn[+]SirScreams 6 points7 points8 points 7 days ago  (0 children)[–]SirScreams 6 points7 points8 points 7 days agoOP had said somewhere else here that the traffic was stop and go, so they must have been going pretty slow. so it probably wasnt that hard. But you do have a point for typical highway driving.

Its a pretty fucking reasonable assumption that the driver was drinking it. So why not call the cops and tell them, get another possible drunk driver off the road.

I think a new game will come in soon and establish a huge fan base and get a esport running. That being said League will still be an esport, just not at the same magnitude it is now.

I cant remember what song it is but they put a small saxophone part in the very end cause they thought it sounded cool, even though it was the only sax part in the song.

It was mature and very insightful about this whole situation. I think i would have to side with him on this, the problem of sexism in gaming is all across the medium and not something that just only is a problem with GTA.

Certainly i would think that if the dudes boss found out he would be fired immediately. Like you said that is probably what happens, but it shouldn't happen.
