Then Jason Sudeikis' characters says "You know what I learned to do? Count to 3 and just do it."
Super simple and it makes perfect sense. Totally dumb movie, but that line really had an effect on me.

You could see dots were the piercing was and I did have to start all back over again when I decided to stretch my lobes again. I'm at 7/16 now and I love em. I work in a Grocery Distribution Center (warehouse job) around all kinds of powered equipment (pallet jacks, fork lifts, etc) and I also have a lot of coworkers whom have their ears gauged as well, one is at 2 1/2", and no one that I know of has ever had problems at work caused by have stretched lobes.
