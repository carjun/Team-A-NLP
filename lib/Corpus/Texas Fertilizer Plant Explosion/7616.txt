Uploaded on Oct 28, 2008



Please visit Alphonse Mouzon's related websites here: http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/Alphonse...http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/alp...http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/mouzonmusichttp://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/mou...http://www.tenaciousrecords.com/Purch... The group performs a medley of Seventh Arrow and Umbrellas(nevermind the "Waterfall" title on the screen) at some point during their 1971 summer tour of Europe. The lineup is Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Miroslav Vitous, Alphonse Mouzon and Dom Um Romao. I realize that versions of this clip already exist on youtube, but the details regarding year and title are wrong and some of the musicians' names have even been misspelled. With this upload, I'm trying to minimize the factual errors and just get it right.
