I'm not saying this in hate, it's a simple fact that if you think that is actual schooling then that mother needs a wake up call. I've met tons of insanely smart homeschoolers but their parents were much better then playdoh and adam and eve. (Even at those kids age).

permalinksavecontextfull comments (666)IndieGameStand: PWYW for Proteus  by  Drago9000in  GameDeals[+]ScienceNAlcohol 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]ScienceNAlcohol 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI had a really confusing first play through of this game. I regret paying full price because honestly it wasn't worth that. It was an experience, not a bad one but not really good either. It was adorable but there wasn't much in terms of progression and I didn't see any narrative at all. I loved dear ester, but that provided context to the situation. It would be a good buy worth like 2.50 because 20 bucks isn't worth an 1.5 hour game (if that).
