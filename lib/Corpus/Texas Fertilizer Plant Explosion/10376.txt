permalinksavecontextfull comments (340)What's the most WTF moment you've witnessed in public?  by  return2ozmain  AskReddit[+]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoNo one can remember whether it was my brother or I, but while on a walk with our grandfather on Austin TX US near his home in the early 90s, one of us, whichever was there said they saw someone jump from the building.  Turned out later that it was a suicide, but gpa didn't Beleive us and we finished our walk. It may not be my memory, but I think it was me because can visual and hear the entire thing. We were wow far away, and it didn't make a real impact on the adults but it did on either one of us, but we both have the same memory of it despite one of us definitely still being in the
 house. Weird and misdirected comment but whatever.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (47)My dating troubles  by  imnobodystypein  AdviceAnimals[+]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 16 days ago  (0 children)[–]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 16 days agoFriend with a similar issue asked me for some advice on this, albeit younger. Do some online dating and eventually you'll go on a few dates with the same girl before getting to that discussion. If it works out, awesome. I'd it doesn't, those count as relationships, they just may not have become serious. Sounds better and can be true so you wouldn't need to lie. Just say 'I've had a few relationships but they never got very serious.' Being your age gives you an advantage in my eyes for a good relationship.  You can date a bit younger women that know who they are and what they want and generally comes with less BS. There is also an advantage many of these women may not realize: you have no baggage whatsoever. OP will be fine.  Good luck out there man. Finding an awesome SO is tough but worth it :)

I thought something along these lines as I am a bit versed with the law (but no lawyer by any means). Thank you again for your insight. I am going to say this verbatim and pretend I came up with it myself ;)

permalinksavecontextfull comments (428)Feelings towards Walt...  by  bigbearbradin  breakingbad[+]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 20 days ago  (0 children)[–]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 20 days agoI want Walt and Jesse to make up as well, but I think Mr. White is dead either way - by cancer or otherwise. I strongly believe in the theories that he is out to save Jesse and that he will die in Jesse's arms. He gives him his last request kind of like the end of Saving Private Ryan and what to do with the money.
But I am rooting for Walt. I guess it's because if I had 10 lives to live I would try to live one like that. Alpha, dominating, assertive, dangerous, criminal. But from the get go obviously.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (151)TIL In 1818, an Englishman was accused of murder claimed the right to trial by combat. To everyone's surprise, the law granting him that right was still valid, and he was acquitted when his accuser declined to appear on the "field of honor." Trial by combat was abolished the next year.  by  Charging_Vanguardin  todayilearned[+]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 21 days ago  (0 children)[–]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 21 days agoThey actually don't.  We do however keep a naval flotilla nearby.  Sauce: the documentary on Netflix 'the world without us' that I watched last night. It's from 2008 so it could be outdated info. We basically have a CIV V defense pact with them, so China knows not to fuck with them for now. 
Edit duck into fuck

permalinksavecontextfull comments (964)Syria accepts Russian chemical weapons proposal  by  kapnastyin  worldnews[+]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 21 days ago  (0 children)[–]x4EVERALONEx 0 points1 point2 points 21 days agoThat's a nice analogy. Nothing is more threatening or has the capability to threaten than a US Navy flotilla with a couple thousands Marines on board who are ready to go at a moments notice (also SF and obviously direct missle strikes/air superiority from the carriers).
Watch the 'world without u.s.' on Netflix.  It goes through why is leaving areas to their own might be a bad idea.  We waited several years to entry the first Balkan genocide because we thought Europe would handle it.  They didn't act forcefully until we did. Sometimes military intervention is a good thing.  It can save millions of innocent lives.  It can also be used poorly as we have debatablely seen recently. 
That's what I got from that documentary anyways. Makes me feel light intervention could stop this before or goes to far or lessen the violence. 
Edit: mobile is hard mode
