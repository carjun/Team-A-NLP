permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat should every girl know by the age of 21?  by  masticatepescetarianin  AskReddit[+]jarlander 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]jarlander 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoMen arent born with the so called "manly skills". Grilling, outdoors, handy-ness, and whatnot. Most guys your age are picking it up as they go and probably doing it on their own for the first time. Try not to be too critical of the guy who is trying, and always offer to help! Even if they say "no thats cool", the offer would go a long way. 
Guys like feeling appreciated too, even if they dont say it.

My buddy made a comment about Baylor being irrelevant still, gets a response from a Baylor twitter handle about how A&M shouldnt be considered an engineering school and "you should only look at collapsed pile of sticks". If you dont know hes referencing our collapsed bonfire that killed 12 people

Not only are they very quick, suprisingly strong, and equiped with a razor sharp beak and suction cups that could rip flesh off, they happen to be amazingly smart. Their problem solving skills are some of the highest in the animal kingdom. Oh and dont forget the ink that could disorient you in a fight. If youre a diver in certain parts of the world you know to stay away from larger squid during their feeding hour. Its not where you want to be.
