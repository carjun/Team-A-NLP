Character defects  by  Slipacrein  stopdrinking[+]coolcrosby 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]coolcrosby 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoGood topic, especially the importance of anonymity.  Astoundingly, ironic how "exposed" or "embarrassed" we can feel in early sobriety when we remember how willingly we played the village idiot and drunk when drinking.  Here, I sit in prison but I'm worried that at some point in the future I might find myself in an AA room and someone might speak of what I shared in that meeting.  On the other hand what a great reminder to those of us in the rooms of AA that new people feel this paranoia--and, some times it's actually not mis-placed fear.  Anonymity isn't a theory, it's a necessary principle--a way of life if you choose our path.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (9)Staying motivated  by  hucksleyin  stopdrinking[+]coolcrosby 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]coolcrosby 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoAs an atheist-agnostic in early sobriety in the rooms of AA, I paid special attention to those with some sobriety when they talked about their concept of a higher power, with an open-mind and a willingness to do what I needed to do to get sober and stay sober.  That little bit of willingness especially to acknowledge--that whatever or whoever was my higher power--it wasn't me.  That made all the difference.  I hope this works out for you, but I got to say, I wish I had the luxury of time to be BORED.
