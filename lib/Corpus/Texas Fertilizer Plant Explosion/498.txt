My heart dropped as soon as I read there was an explosion in Waco. I guess I'm relieved that it wasn't close to the school, but it's a bittersweet relief.

permalinksaveparent[+]5zero 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]5zero 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoYeah, same im eating at penland watching the news... there should be student groups going to donate blood tomorrow morning from what i hear...

permalinksaveparent[+]Bandefaca 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Bandefaca 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoAs a PSA if you're donating blood; if the folks get all the blood they need after a large tragedy, a lot of times, there's a dip in the blood supply about a month afterwards, because that's when the blood expires, but you can only donate once every 8 weeks. If people are considering donating, tell them to ask the organization when the best time would be to donate.

permalinksaveparent[+]5zero 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]5zero 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agosure thing! I'm actually really proud of all the support Baylor students are organizing :D

permalinksaveparent[+]Hfino 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (6 children)[–]Hfino 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThis has nothing to do with the incident, but due to the news I started looking at the map of Waco and surroundings and reading about Baylor University, and I had some questions if you could answer me. How conservative are people in Waco and at BU? And are people in Waco from upper, middle or lower class mainly?

permalinksaveparent[+]Bandefaca 5 points6 points7 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]Bandefaca 5 points6 points7 points 5 months agoBaylor's pretty conservative, generally speaking, lots of upper/middle class white kids.
Waco is very different, however. There's a lot of poorer minorities within Waco. In fact, on campus we call campus the "Baylor bubble"; they have a perimeter of lights all around the campus, as well as a pretty active police force. There's more upper-class areas south and west of Waco, in the same manner as suburbs, but the area isn't big enough to call them suburbs, and they aren't as sprawling as suburbs. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Hfino 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]Hfino 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoThank you very much for the answer. I am always really curious about these towns in the US and their lifestyle, and the contrasts they have. I saw on google street view and it didn't seem really rich so it does make sense for Baylor to be called the "Baylor bubble", although there are some areas that look richer than others, if you follow hillcrest drive in the direction of Waco Lake there is a really big house there. Is it well known that house? lol, sorry for the random question. Do you like studying in BU?

permalinksaveparent[+]Bandefaca 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Bandefaca 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoYeah, definitely, it's my pleasure. I don't know the house you're talking about in particular; I've only been studying here for 2 semesters, but I know that Waco's had a long history of booms and busts. I want to say the space industry was big here several decades ago, but I might be wrong. There are definitely images of that in some of the buildings downtown though, it's really neat.
As for Baylor, I really enjoy it here. It's a private Christian university,  but they don't shove it down peoples' throats. While there are a couple of required classes on the Bible and the history of Christianity, they're from an academic perspective, and dissent isn't quickly hidden away. As a Biology major, I'm especially glad they don't waste any time even mentioning creationism; the science classes here are about science. I'd have to say a great draw has been the people here. It's not so big that you become a number and it's not so small that everyone seems to be the same. While upper/middle class white kids are the majority, there's still a decent amount of diversity. Overall, I'm very glad I ended up picking Baylor to study at.

permalinksaveparent[+]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoAlmost chose BU, visited it for two or three days a few years back, but chose another uni in TX. BU is very highly regarded academically, has a beautiful campus, and good sport teams. As a quick temperature read on opinion from someone in state but not studying at BU.

permalinksaveparent[+]Tortanto 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Tortanto 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoLike most private schools, if you're not getting any scholarship you better be rich as hell if you want to go to Baylor.

permalinksaveparent[+]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Skopos 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoOh for sure. I was offered a really nice scholarship, but got a better offer. Otherwise BU wouldn't have been on the radar. BU has a mix of hard-working students who got the grades to be there, financially, and those of more affluent backgrounds. I liked that though, overall, while visiting I got the impression most students liked their school and worked hard, and still had fun, seemed to be a great culture not weighed down by affluence.
