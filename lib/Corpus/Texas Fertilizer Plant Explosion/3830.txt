West, Texas -- Cars stretched for almost a mile Saturday as displaced residents gathered to see their homes for the first time since the deadly fertilizer plant explosion last week that destroyed scores of properties.Some residents with houses in the outer blast zone, those farthest away from the West Fertilizer Co. plant, were allowed to return Saturday.The blast leveled five city blocks, including a nursing home and intermediate school, and destroyed up to 60 homes, officials said. Fifteen people have been confirmed dead and nearly 200 were injured. At a news conference Saturday, Mayor Pro Tem Steve Vanek said reports about continuing health or safety concerns in the blast zone were false. "It is safe, it is safe, it is safe," Vanek said.The Associated Press reported that small tanks on the site were leaking and started fires Saturday, which were contained.The victims of the blast still have not been officially identified. Their remains have been taken to a Dallas forensic lab for autopsies. Many were known to be firefighters. For returning residents, access to their homes came with restrictions. Only two vehicles were allowed at each residence, and a curfew would be enforced after 7 p.m., Vanek said.Anyone staying overnight was doing so "at your own risk," he said, because there was limited access to water, electricity and natural gas. Residents were also warned of hazards like broken glass, nails and debris.Neighborhoods will be opened only when they are deemed safe by the state fire marshal's office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The bureau's national response team, which was called in Friday, is responsible for making sure all evidence that could be related to the fire is collected, said Franceska Perot, an ATF spokeswoman."We're trying to work as quickly as possible," Perot said Saturday. "We document everything. With the degree of damage it's a daunting job. There are huge areas that need to be worked."Perot said she could not estimate when investigators might learn the cause of the fire.Late Friday, President Obama issued an emergency declaration for the town of 2,800 people, according to reports. Gov. Rick Perry has also declared the area a disaster. The designations allow for aid to be accelerated.
