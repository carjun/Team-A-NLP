The Roland Juno-60 is a classic six voice polyphonic analog synthesizer with RAM memories for 56 sounds. The sound architecture is rather basic, but it has an excellent sound and was used by many professionals like Eurythmics, Howard Jones, the Madonna producers, Paul Van Dyk and many more... it has the DCB interface - the predecessor of MIDI. With a DCB to MIDI interface it is very easy to integrate the instrument in a midi setup. To my ears the JUNO-60 sounds far better than the very similar JUNO-106 (I had both). It has snappier envelopes and a fater chorus. However, sound is a matter of taste...
