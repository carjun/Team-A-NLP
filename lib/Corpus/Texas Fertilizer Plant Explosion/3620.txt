About
You found a Tumblr post about how a brave transgendered feminist made a white cismale check his privilege? I still get aroused every time I think about how that happened in real life.
Your Facebook wall tells a tale of how the newest 15-year-old Atheist put that fundie in their place? The girlfriend who you haven't met because she goes to a different school totally saw it happen and verified it for me.
You have a rage comic describing a man making a woman orgasm by song alone? Totally happened, I used to sleep with that woman before the man's audible vibrator took her away.
Post all of these stories and more here, a place where we collect and verify the truest stories on Reddit.
Some basic rules apply, give them a read before posting a 100% true story or commenting on one.
Rules
Hover over each item for details







No posting any personal information.
Finding someone's personal information like a real name, a facebook account, twitter, etc, and posting it in the comments is grounds for a ban from the entire website.


No bullying of any kind.
Do not harass anyone you find here or encourage others to harass them. Do not be nasty to your fellow users. Any posting from a reddit link must replace the "www" with an "np." Any bullying on /r/thatHappened or "in the name of" /r/thatHappened is means for an automatic banning.


Make an effort with your title!
Titles MUST describe the event, be written like a newpaper headline, and should make the reader say "Yep. That happened." This thread goes into greater detail as to what an appropriate title consists of.


All submissions must be a link to a story
This subreddit is for utterly plausible and believable tales told in a manner that is 100% not twisted, exaggerated, or self-aggrandizing. If what you're linking is just a sentence or two, it likely doesn't fit here.


Remember the NSFW tag if the post isn't safe for work.
The button can be found within the "comment, save, share, hide" group.


No blatant reposts from either the Cringe group of subreddits and no reposts at all from either our own subreddit or /r/4chan.
This is an example of what IS NOT allowed.


No Advice Animals or other similar memes.
Seriously, reposts suck and you suck for posting them.


No "liek dis if u cri evrytim"-esque chain letters, emails, and so on.
This an example of what IS NOT allowed.


No macro images UNLESS they tell a tale.
This is an example of what IS NOT allowed.


No creating your own event and pushing it off as an event that actually happened. We find out, you get banned.
We can't have made-up things sullying a subreddit dedicated to only true stories that are 100% true and actually happened.This is an example of what IS NOT allowed.
