Roland Jupiter 8 (12 bit version) - 1981 model - all sounds programmed and recorded by me.....some years ago. I was an EQ novice back then...hence why this demo sounds a little sharp, cold, shrill...perhaps even metallic. Make no mistake, the Jupiter is a lovely warm synth....Thanks for making this JUPITER video the most viewed in the world!200,000 hits as at May 13th 2011250,000 hits as at November 27th 2011300,000 hits as at November 1st 2012
