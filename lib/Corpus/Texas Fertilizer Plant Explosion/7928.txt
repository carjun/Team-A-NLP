permalinksave[+]what_about_ashlee 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]what_about_ashlee 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoBig Tex went down in a blaze of glory last year, the last day of the fair. He had a good run. Yes , we rebuilt him. This one you see this year is brand new.

permalinksaveparent[+]what_about_ashlee 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours ago  (0 children)[–]what_about_ashlee 0 points1 point2 points 22 hours agoI like the new big tex too. The other one was nice and classic. It's just a shame we couldn't retire him properly. We could've put the old one in a nice history of the fair display if he didn't get all burnt up.
