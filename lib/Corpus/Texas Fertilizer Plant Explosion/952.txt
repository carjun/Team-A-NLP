A smashed car sits in front of an apartment complex destroyed by an explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, as firefighters conduct a search and rescue Thursday, April 18, 2013. A massive explosion at the West Fertilizer Co. Wednesday night killed as many as 15 people and injured more than 160, officials said overnight.

Complete coverage: West fertilizer plant explosion














Bettye Tucker is unflappable as well-wishers and needy townspeople flock to her business office in downtown West. She owns much of the property destroyed in Wednesday's explosion. Tucker, 82, lives by herself in a four-bedroom house two blocks from the fertilizer plant that blew up, killing and uprooting scores of residents of the Central Texas community.In an exclusive interview with the Dallas Morning News, she explained that until bedtime Wednesday, her husband Jake, 86, who has dementia, lived just a half block away. He was a resident in the now-shattered West Rest Haven nursing home.Both survived falling sheetrock. A neighbor rescued Bettye and she then directed men to rescue her husband. They became separated, though, during a confused, 2 mile scramble to a VFW hall near the town’s community center.Bettye said she had to dispense with manners and yell at one volunteer who grabbed her by the arm. He wanted to escort her to buses transporting more than 130 nursing home residents to other cities.“I’m not rest home,” she recalled shouting. “I’m on my own! Let me go.”On Friday, Bettye hugged and consoled tenants who lived in her and Jake’s 22-unit apartment building near the plant. It was devastated.“I’m over the pneumonia,” she said, taking a friend’s call and condensing her account to a half-dozen sentences. “I was not hurt. Jake was not hurt. I have no home. I’m staying with my daughter. Just pray for me.”Bettye said she intends for the nursing home, the apartment building and as many of her nearly 20 rental homes to be rebuilt as soon as possible – as long as the fertilizer plant is relocated.“I feel sure it will be,” she said, though she hasn’t spoken with plant owner Donald Adair.“I believe it will take care of itself.”Read more in Saturday’s paper…
