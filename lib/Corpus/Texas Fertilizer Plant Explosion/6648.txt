At the very least her candidacy is going to make Greg Abbott work for it. In the last few statewide elections, the Republican primary was the only one that counted and the only way to win the Republican primary was to go further to the right than the other candidates.  That leaves us with guys like Barry Smitherman who is going to become the next Texas Attorney General on a platform of Texas secession from the United States.  Maybe, just maybe, if Greg Abbott gets a little scare from Wendy Davis, he may be forced to come back to the center, even if it's just a little, that's an accomplishment.

permalinksave[+]DrMcIntire 12 points13 points14 points 23 hours ago  (0 children)[–]DrMcIntire 12 points13 points14 points 23 hours agoWendy Davis is not a wedge issue candidate if you look at her legislative track record. She cares about education, healthcare, and jobs - and her history in the legislature will prove that. 
For what it's worth, I have met her many times and she's always remembered me and independently brought up things I would want to know about the issues she knows concern me (higher education funding in particular).  I'm nobody special in the community. I can't fund her campaign or magnify her message beyond the scope of small posts like this and interactions with my friends and colleagues, but she legitimately cares education and I've been majorly impressed with her work on that and other issues that matter.

Google auto complete shows the first clues, typing in "Greg Abbott ra" autocompletes to racist.  So that's promising.   Very first link : 
"Greg Abbott Has A Very Friendly Relationship With A Racist Blog"

Greg Abbott and his team are far too close to a right-wing blogger named Robbie Cooper who calls black people "animals" and the N-word.
Cooper runs an Austin-based blog called Urban Grounds. Recently, top Abbott strategist Dave Carney hit the 'tweet' button while reading one of Cooper's posts calling Wendy Davis "too stupid to be governor". 

Well look at that.  2 minutes of google and the mystery is solved.
Lazy republicans make my job so easy.

In January, Abbott gave an exclusive interview to Cooper at a Right Online bootcamp in Austin.

Exclusive interviews with racist web sites.  Keep up the good work Greg.
But hey make sure you vote for / support this guy, cause he sounds like a Real Texan wink wink.

Brilliant deductive work, there.  By that logic, Obama, Bush, and Clinton (in fact, pretty much any public figures) are all racist.  Incidentally, "Wendy Davis rac" brings up the same result - and it only requires one extra letter!

top Abbott strategist Dave Carney hit the 'tweet' button while reading one of Cooper's posts

So, via the inarguable tactic of "Six-degrees of Any Racists Anywhere", you managed to get to Abbot in two degrees.  Congrats.  As it happens, a certain grandparent of mine is a bit racist, so that makes me 1 degree.  I'm practically a KKK member.
Incidentally, searching Cooper's blog shows that he's only used the dreaded "N-word" when quoting/paraphrasing - here.  Of course, having a conservative point out the ridiculous to insane social strictures around racially charged epitaphs is, in itself, racist, so that saves you the trouble of actually considering something from a different point of view.  We don't want you to hurt yourself, after all.
I can't wait for your follow-up where you argue that Obama is a terrorist bomber because of his association with Ayers.  I'll be happy to point out the flaws in that argument too, but I'm not sure you'll understand the parallel.

it's this entire perspective that caused the mess we are in today. that whole "you people" crap has to go, or we are just going to be in-fighting over petty bullshit until we really do render this planet uninhabitable.
in case you haven't noticed, the people you are sitting here bashing are your neighbors, your teachers, your doctors, and your police force, and in case you haven't noticed, this whole bi-partisan system has recently derailed to produce a gigantic cluster fuck of a government shutdown.
our government is shut down, sir, and for you to sit there and pretend like the problem lies with some imaginary line across the screen in the voting booth is as asinine as some of the fucked up policies YOU PEOPLE vote for.

You're quoting the wrong guy there ;)... but it's good to know that there are people as eminently reasonable as yourself out there.  Doubtless, we would wake up to find ourselves in utopian splendor if only we cast aside such false aspersions as left vs. right, and listened to voices such as yours, which are so wonderfully above the chaotic political fracas below.  But please do tread carefully - we wouldn't want to get any human dirt on your angelic essence.

You people on the left get so butt-hurt by anything you don't agree with, that the best way to make it look is, 'racist' or 'sexist' to discredit them. Just like the NRA is 'racist', and Democrat's calling Republicans 'jiahdist's'. If you can't prove something, just call it racist, and pull up some google search and find this guy got interviewed by someone who is racist, who cares? Obama is buddies with Bill Ayers, who was involved in a bombing to kill Chicago Police officers, but that's ok, because Ayers was doing it for the people right?

permalinksaveparent[+]regent040  comment score below threshold  (0 children)[–]regent040 -6 points-5 points-4 points 1 day agoGreg Abbott might not be a racist or a sexist, or a classist, but the people he needs to vote for him in the Republican primary are so he has to speak their language in order to appeal to them.  Even if it's just done with a nod and a wink, he still has to come across as one of them. He has to play along whenever someone at an east Texas town hall meeting calls African Americans "Democrats" and laughs.  He has to smile and pretend to laugh along when he's at a fundraiser in Dallas and a deep pocketed asshole tell a sexist or racist joke that makes some who are within earshot cringe.  He has to play the game and right now, the Republican party is controlled by racist, sexist, classist dicks.

However, if she really is a libertarian, then I'd imagine her positions are things like ending the drug war, lower taxes, lower spending, less regulation etc. She's probably sounding like a crazed loon while spouting it because anyone who can clearly articulate Libertarian principles without sounding like a conspiracy theorist typically gets snatched up by the Republicans before quickly being ostracized by them for not falling in line.

permalinksaveparent[+]StMichaeI 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours ago  (3 children)[–]StMichaeI 1 point2 points3 points 22 hours agoHow is a state fighting back against an ever encroaching federal government "loony"? The founding fathers had a pretty good idea going for them: States do the majority of the governing and law making, feds deal with standard currency, military and international affairs.
Was the existence, and eventual abolishment, of slavery that strong an argument for the federal government to start controlling our guns, marriage, retirement, healthcare and everything else they spend $4 trillion dollars a year on?

permalinksaveparent[+]schrodes 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago  (2 children)[–]schrodes 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours agoSo basically, the federal government can never address public problems  that StMichaeI does not personally understand. FYI, the elderly experienced extreme poverty before we had a national pension. Privatized healthcare has been a disaster in the US for decades, with rising costs and nothing to show for it in terms of life expectancy, infant mortality rates, etc., when compared to other industrialized nations with better systems. Yet here you are opposing a more efficient approach to healthcare spending based on some crazy ideal that the federal government can never venture outside of the duties outlined by men who lived 200 years ago. Instead of opposing all reform on principle, why don't you instead try to understand how informed public policy actually effects people in the real world? Hopefully, one day you will outgrow this ideological rut and realize why outcomes (such as effectiveness of a healthcare system) are far more important than strongly held beliefs.

If anything, I'd trust a state politician over the President to know what's going on in my state, what problems we're facing locally and how best to go about solving it. 
Putting that aside, it's individual human beings that make progress in this world, not governments. Advancements in medicine, technology, science, mathematics, engineering, logistics, economics, they all come from individuals smart enough or driven enough to make it happen. 
PS, I wouldn't point to Social Security as a success story. We've barely gotten one full generation through it and it's already within a decade of insolvency.

Is there something magic about Federal politicians that make them inherently smarter and more capable of figuring out the infinitely complex problems of everyday Americans than state level politicians?

Well, yes. They have to think abou thtings on a larger federal level. It helps to leverage what is happening in a region or state and how would affect the larger company and surrounding states. 
Individual people make progress by working together in governments. They make laws with regulations to make sure people's interests are protected when they are in opposition to corporations and try to ensure people's health by tracking health and enviromental issues.

We don't need any liberals elected to office here in Texas... we don't want to be California with their high taxes, Naziesque gun laws, economic decay and nannyism.

permalinksaveparent[+]neocon_pride  comment score below threshold  (9 children)[–]neocon_pride -8 points-7 points-6 points 1 day agoThis is a thread relating to politics. I saw a comment above calling Greg Abbott racist, classist and sexist... that's more inflammatory than mine and you did not call it out. Why is that?  

permalinksaveparent[+]AgITGuyborn and bred 9 points10 points11 points 1 day ago  (6 children)[–]AgITGuyborn and bred 9 points10 points11 points 1 day agoIt was due to the nature of each.  /u/Valerialia made a statement about something that the candidate could say in the future.  
I felt your remarks were more derogatory and less about good discussion.  To make a statement that we, as a whole and single entity the people of Texas, don't need something is wrong and does not represent the whole.  Having a democrat elected does not immediately cause the inclusion of: 
|California with their high taxes, Naziesque gun laws, economic decay and nannyism.
Did I miss anything?

Not saying the dems are fascist. It's not a secret that California's struggling greatly economically due to its high taxes. He may have not composed his comments in a sensitive way but neither do most people on Reddit.

You failed to see the truth in the statements, I suppose.

permalinksaveparent[+]AgITGuyborn and bred 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]AgITGuyborn and bred 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoNo, I saw a jump in causal reasoning due to a hypothetical situation.  The statement went from possible to without a doubt expected in record time with no supporting evidence.

permalinksaveparent[+]neocon_pride  comment score below threshold  (0 children)[–]neocon_pride -6 points-5 points-4 points 1 day agoNo. He said that Abbott would end up putting a foot in his mouth because he was sexist, racist and classist. 
Are you saying that California has low taxes, gun friendly laws, a booming economy and few laws regulating personal behavior? That's the trend that blue states follow... and like it or not starting to elect Democrats to state level will set us in that direction. 

permalinksaveparent[+]erveek 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]erveek 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoYou called her a Nazi. That is more inflammatory than calling someone racist, classist and sexist.
Unless you agree with nazis.

permalinksaveparent[+]regent040 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]regent040 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoTexas and the south used to be liberal? Care to explain where you got that from? If you are talking about the historical fact that Texas and the south used to be solidly Democrat, that's not because they were liberal, it's because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Strom Thurmond, George Wallace, and Lester Maddox were all Democrats, they sure as hell weren't liberal.The only reason the south and Texas switched to become solidly Republican is because of Democratic Presidents Kennedy and LBJ signed civil rights legislation into law.
