People walking out of a restaurant more than 2 miles away said they were blown back and knocked down by the force of the blast.

What does this mean for the people in the video? Would they have been legitimately injured by the blast? Or was it just temporary hearing loss?

permalinksaveparent[+]verik 310 points311 points312 points 5 months ago* (47 children)[–]verik 310 points311 points312 points 5 months ago*Perforated eardrums are a bitch (and I'm willing to bet, guaranteed to have happened at that proximity to such a blast).  Yes, "temporary hearing loss" as in, takes a month or few to recover and chance of never fully recovering hearing range.
edit: update - thankfully it appears no perforated drums for either as an individual mentioned the child was on the today show

permalinksaveparent[+]batman9513 140 points141 points142 points 5 months ago  (20 children)[–]batman9513 140 points141 points142 points 5 months agoThey really are. Took me about a month and a half to get full hearing back after I perforated my eardrum. Hurts like a bitch too.

permalinksaveparent[+]peekoooz 14 points15 points16 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]peekoooz 14 points15 points16 points 5 months agoI got kicked in the head in a swimming pool when I was ~13 and the water rushing into my hear ruptured my eardrum.  The ENT I went to said 1/5 of my eardrum was missing.  It grew back, and I did have some hearing loss for a while, but as far as I can tell my hearing is fine now.
It was the second most painful thing I've experienced, following my broken tailbone.  I'm lucky I was able to get out of the pool because I couldn't tell which way was up and no one was paying attention to me.  I crawled out of the pool and fell over on the concrete because I had no balance.  It was miserable and the doctors couldn't do anything to treat it or and didn't do anything for the pain.  They just looked at it and sent me home.  I'm paranoid about swimming with other people now, even though it was a "freak accident" type thing – his foot hit me at just the right wrong angle.
I can't imagine being near a blast like this and potentially having both ears impacted by it.  I'm dizzy just thinking about it.

permalinksaveparent[+]stufoonoob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]stufoonoob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoFuck, that's absolutely terrifying. So based on the fact that your sense of balance is centralized in your ears, is that what got thrown all out of whack? 

permalinksaveparent[+]Oxide42 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago* (3 children)[–]Oxide42 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago*As someone whose eardrums have been perforated three times in my life, all due to water damage (twice healing naturally; the last time having a paper patch applied), I can say balance/equilibrium was never an issue for myself. But according to Wikipedia, it's not unheard of, even though it's not a common side effect. I'd imagine his disorientation came mainly from being kicked in the head underwater. Being kicked in the head in just about any location would probably make me lose my bearings for a second, I'd think.  

permalinksaveparent[+]stufoonoob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]stufoonoob 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoAh gotcha, ok that makes sense. I was gonna say, could you imagine being perfectly aware but essentially drunk in a pool because you can't control your balance? Terrifying. 

permalinksaveparent[+]krunchitize 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]krunchitize 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoWhen you got the patch did they have to poke/scrape your eardrum to make it bleed on the patch to assist healing?  That was the most painful thing I have ever experienced.

permalinksaveparent[+]Oxide42 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Oxide42 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoNo, he just dipped it into some sort of solution and stuck it on there. It was my last perforation (probably about 10 years ago), and it was a very clean one - no redness or irritation, which isn't typically the case. I could instantly hear a little more after he put the patch on, and over the next few weeks it got back to about normal.

permalinksaveparent[+]Ausgeflippt 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Ausgeflippt 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoI've perforated my right eardrum twice.
The first time was during diving training when my BCV had a bad fill valve that stuck open and I shot from two atmospheres of pressure to less than one (was well above sea-level) very rapidly. Immediate rupture of the right eardrum. My hearing was always a little off and the ear didn't clear well after that. Sometimes stuff sounded like the adults in Peanuts. Wah wah wah wah wahhh.
The second time was fairly recently when I got a really nasty ear infection, the antibiotics didn't help, and the eardrum wound up rupturing due to fluid buildup. It was so incredibly loud and sudden. It startled the shit out of me. I saw a doctor a couple hours later when their office opened, they saw that it was ruptured, they took a culture and sent me on my way with cephalexin. I had to go to Maryland (3000 miles away) a few days later and they wound up calling my home phone (against my specific instructions to call my cell) and leaving a message that I actually had a very bad staph infection and that they were prescribing Cipro immediately. I didn't get that message for over a week. Thankfully it cleared up. I don't like the idea of stuff in my body going septic.
Oddly enough, after the second rupture healed (took about 6 weeks), my hearing is better than it was before the first one with tests to confirm, and it clears much easier.
Moral of the story- protect your ears. Ruptures are a bitch.

Blew out both my ear drums and I constantly get ear infections. Not to mention anything with bass hurts like hell. Music, forget about it, when you have an war infection it's waaaaaaay worse too. I've had multiple surgeries to repair and have around 60% hearing in my left ear, although that's the one that hurts the most and gets infected often. I have about 40% hearing in my right ear. 
I hate talking to people because I constantly keep asking "what"? Or the equivalent and it annoys the shit out of people. Most think I'm ignoring them when I don't respond. I constantly have to sniff to regulate the pressure in my ears so it doesn't hurt all the time. People must think I'm a huge coke addict, but it is a habit that I don't even realize I do it anymore. Others contribute it to allergies and don't say anything. 
Totally tone deaf too. Karaoke night sucks so I just blame it on the a a a a alcohol.

permalinksaveparent[+]eawsound 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]eawsound 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoGiven that it was an impulse (as opposed to a longer but still loud sound) it's likely they experienced some level of permanent hearing damage.
When sound enters your ear, it acts on your ear drum and causes it to vibrate.  Your ear drum is connected to a chain of three bones in you middle ear.  When your ear drum moves, it moves the bones as well, which act on the cochlea, which is the organ that translates pressure waves into electrical signals to be sent to your brain.
Some of the bones have muscles attached to them, and when the muscles are engaged it prevents the bones from moving freely.  When this happens, less energy is transferred from the motion of the ear drum to the cochlea, which protects the delicate hair cells in the cochlea.  These muscles are engaged when we hear a very loud sound, especially if it's a loud sound over a period of time.  This is why if you've ever been to a loud concert, after you return home it's hard to hear for a while.  Those muscles are engaged to protect your hearing.
However, your brain needs time to react to the level of sound around you and determine if it should engage the muscles or not.  When a very loud, very short sound occurs like what happened in the explosion, your brain does not have enough time to engage the muscles.  By the time it detects the wave the damage has already been done.  
The little girl is more susceptible than her father to damage.  My guess would be if they do not have permanent hearing loss they will at least have tinnitus (ringing in the ears).

A powerful blast wave, apart from fucking up your ears, can basically explode all the little capillaries, venules and arterioles in your lungs and cause you do drown to death in your own blood. Or just pop your lung like a balloon. Among other organ damage as well.
They'd have probably been fine either way, however, as it looks like they were a decent ways off (relatively)

permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoDepends. As mentioned by others, they may experience degrees of hearing loss. One big thing that hasn't been mentioned is the effect of pressure changes. High altitudes like planes and diving hurts like someone taking a sharp poker and sticking it in your ear. I can't go below 6ft of water without a horrible pain that lasts about 30 minutes. I even had skin grafts and they healed so my eardrums aren't perforated anymore. Although, they are still too weak to adjust pressure without causing pain. 

permalinksaveparent[+]irving47 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]irving47 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI'd imagine the car protected them quite a bit... Too bad the window was down... Unless it would have caused high velocity glass shards to hit them...?

permalinksaveparent[+]ryandinho14 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]ryandinho14 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoAt least perforated eardrums, likely vision-related injuries as well as burns from the heat wave and ligament damage from the shock wave.

Unless they were hanging out the window they wouldn't have any significant shrapnel or burn damage. The pressure wave likely ruptured eardrums and could have collapsed a lung, but they are likely ok in the long run.
The primary danger in explosions is shrapnel, followed by the pressure wave. The people two miles away might well have been knocked down, but a big boom followed by a small pressure wave is probably quite shocking and if you weren't expecting it even a small push can knock you down.

permalinksaveparent[+]Chuff_Nugget 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Chuff_Nugget 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoDon't worry: if it's a legitimate injury the body has ways of dealing with it. 

permalinksaveparent[+]rachelintexas 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]rachelintexas 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoJust saw the Dad and his daughter interviewed on local news. They're fine. Their hearing is back. The blast took out his windshield (he wasn't specific as to which one) and dented his truck, but they're OK. 

permalinksaveparent[+]ManWhoKilledHitler 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]ManWhoKilledHitler 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoHuman bodies are surprisingly blast resistant and people can survive (with injuries) overpressures that are enough to demolish most buildings.
The problem is that you can be far enough away that the blast alone isn't enough to kill but you could be thrown into something or be hit by breaking glass or shrapnel and die from those injuries.

permalinksaveparent[+]UnseenAlchemist 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]UnseenAlchemist 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoCould've blown her eardrums out. It even sounded like some debris was hitting the car.

permalinksaveparent[+]jstev612 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]jstev612 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoor it was just super duper loud and people are a bit freaked out.
