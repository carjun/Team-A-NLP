How much pressure do you think that puts on a developer? The first game planted the seed in gamers. The second game made it bloom. The third game has to be a fucking redwood or else they won't live up to the hype. 
How stressful can that be for Gabe?

It's baffling to have this problem, cause porn usage for me goes to near zero when I have a healthy sex life... even when I don't get everything I want. 
So please don't "feelsSoworthless"... it's not you. It's him and his fucked up head. Porn addiction is bad. Consider a serious talk about it.

I mean, I have a general preference of what I like, and it can be unsatisfying if I get a "no" to a certain position. If there is no real trend, then it isn't you... it's all him. 

permalinksavecontextfull commentsHowever minor it may be, what was your own 15 minutes of fame?  by  Stuball1992in  AskMen[+]The_Man_Radan 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago  (0 children)[–]The_Man_Radan 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoI've real life goomba stomped someone. 
It was middle school, I was on the wrestling team. I just won my match and I was high fiving all of my team mates on one of the sides of the mat. Perpendicular was the opposing team's cheer leaders (sitting down), so I was running straight at them, not realizing until the last second. I then... uh... tried jumping over this one girl. 
I goomba stomped her good. Got a couple of more high fives after that. 

permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhy Will A Lot of Guys Sleep with Most Anything?  by  medusa15in  AskMen[+]The_Man_Radan 3 points4 points5 points 10 hours ago  (0 children)[–]The_Man_Radan 3 points4 points5 points 10 hours agoUh, please don't try and generalize. I sense some angst in this post, but I could be wrong. 
To answer your question, sex for some guys is what they crave. Other guys crave other things. For example, if I had a choice to spend the night going to bar that would eventually lead to sex at the end of the night... OR... do any other activity that doesn't require drinking/hitting on drunk girls... I would pick the latter. Why? Not all guys are always out to get sex.
Hell, I purposefully put on resting bitch face so some people don't bother me. And I a mean and hateful person? Absolutely not, but it's annoying when someone tries to make a phatic conversation with me with the sole intent of sex. 
Yes, I'm fucking crazy for not wanting to bang every chick I see, get over it.

permalinksavecontextfull commentsIs a car necessary for a successful relationship?  by  [deleted]in  AskMen[+]The_Man_Radan 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]The_Man_Radan 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoUh, no. There are plenty of people (both guys and girls) who don't have cars and make their relationships work. If someone has a problem with you not having a car, that's not a person you want. 
Does it make dating easier? Yes it does. You are able to go anywhere easily, but will it enhance your experience versus not having a car? Doubtful. 
It's all about convenience.
