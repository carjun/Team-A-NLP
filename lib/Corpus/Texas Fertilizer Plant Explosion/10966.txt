I'm currently at work at the front desk of a hotel in College Station, TX, and I just had a guest check out 2 days early and sprint to his car to head over there. Apparently it's his hometown and he's going to see what he can do to help.

There were many unfortunate effects of the explosion.  It affected many residents and effected damage to many buildings.

Fertilizer contains ammonium nitrate which is a highly volatile chemical. It's not unlikely for the conditions to be ripe for an explosion, especially somewhere as dry as central Texas is right now.
Edited since the explosion didn't take place in Waco directly.

Unfortunately, this plant is right next to Waco, Texas, and this week is the 20th anniversary of the siege there.  The date alone has historically inspired right-wing terrorist attacks, including the Oklahoma City bombing.  So while I hope this was an accident, the other factors involved leave me unwilling to write off the possibility of terrorism until we have more information.

Small community of about 2500 with a popular stop called the Czech Bakery where you can get the best Kolaches known to man.

I literally kept refreshing my Google News search for "West, TX explosion" until the first article appeared and then I posted that one. I don't know what I did wrong that someone beat me to it by thirty minutes, but that is why I included that in there.

"Breaking" news is supposed to mean 1 of 2 things.... originally it meant that the news was sooooo important that TV stations would interrupt regularly scheduled programming in order to bring you the news immediately.
Later it changed and was used in a manner to mean "it just recently happened".  It was fresh news.
Now it seems to be used (not in this case, but in general) for shit that's 7 hours old.  It's no longer fresh, and you certainly aren't interrupting sporting events and prime time TV to talk about it.
