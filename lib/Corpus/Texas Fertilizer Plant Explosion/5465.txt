This is the UK version of G.I.Joe called Action Force. Cobra is Cobra but G.I.Joe are Action Force. More info belowLyric: Its Action Force against cobra the enemy fighting to save the day.They will never give up there always there fighting for freedom over land and airAction Force - International heroesAction Force are thereAction Force will dareAction ForceAction Force is the codename for highly trained rapid deployment force.It's purpose, to defend human freedom against Cobra a ruthless, terrorist organization.Action Force - International HeroesAction Force will dareAction ForceMore Info (wiki):In 1985 Palitoy ceded control of the European market to Hasbro following the death of one of Palitoy's owners (Alfred Pallett) and the winding-up of operations at their Leicester factory. Hasbro purchased the Palitoy factory, copyrights and moulds[8] and began to package G.I. Joe figures under the Action Force brand. In characterization terms, this move marked the end of the sub-grouping of the Action Force team and a new unified Action Force (or AF) also faced a new enemy in the name of Cobra.The parallel comic book storylines also maintained continuity with a number of plotlines that blended elements of the second range of figures with the third, featuring the new characters as an international elite anti-terrorist unit of a wider Action Force still backed up by the Z Force, SAS and other units fighting Cobra, the Red Shadows and even a re-animated Adolf Hitler and the Nazis[9] (despite being ostensibly set in the present day). Over time however the range melded into an unreconstructed G. I. Joe force and its enemy Cobra.
