Chalant As You Want Studios is a studio dedicated to Young Justice pairings! Basically if you love any of the pairs in Young Justice, this is the studio for you, as we will be using yaoi, het, yuri, etc. If you are to be in this studio, keep in mind that we will not allow couple bashing. Even if you don't like slash, or if you don't like het even, you have to respect the other members preferences.This studio is owned by XxDarkXBeautyxX, xAnonymousArtist and xDesertRoseTemarix! We will be the ones judging as well :)DEADLINE: December 17, results will be up on the 18 or 19Rules and Guidelines!1. No hentai please, we do not want younger viewers to see stuff like that, and that increases the risk of your entry being flagged and unable to stay entered2. If your video gets taken down, you can PM either the owner or co-owner with a download link and we'll put you on the list anyway. However, please try to get the video re-uploaded.3. Slideshows/MMVs are allowed, and will be judged on the same level as AMVs4. Young Justice COUPLES only. No 'somes.6. No using other peoples work, you will be disqualified if you are caught7. Video must be at least 30 seconds.8. Post your video as a response to this one please9. Pre-made videos are allowed. 10. Please be able to render in full screen. We want all MEP parts in full MEPs to be the same size, and we prefer full screen.Over all, you will be judged on how well the video fits with the music you chose, and your creativity and how hard you work on your video. Remember, it shows!
