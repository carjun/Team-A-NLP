            A national trade group that represents fertilizer suppliers recently sought to convince federal lawmakers that retailers that blend fertilizer — such as West Fertilizer Co. — should be excluded from rules requiring them to cooperate in the development of emergency plans and to publicly reveal their chemical inventories.The Agricultural Retailers Association said in its 2012 congressional lobbying report that it seeks to “work with the EPA to clarify their new Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act interpretation of fertilizer retailer to exclude facilities that blend fertilizer.”According to association representatives, the blending of dry fertilizer, such as ammonium nitrate, is extremely safe and lumping blenders in with manufacturers represents a regulatory burden for small businesses. It’s not clear what caused Wednesday’s explosion at the West plant, which occurred after business hours.During a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee meeting last year, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., declared that “if EPA continues down this road they will be imposing additional costs on hundreds of small businesses and farmers in rural America.”However, it’s not just the West Fertilizer explosion that shows the potential dangers inside blending facilities. In 2009, a fire at the El Dorado Chemical Co. in Bryan, which also stores and blends fertilizer, caused the first mandatory evacuation in the city’s history and injured dozens.According to the Sunlight Foundation, which first reported the lobbying effort, the Agricultural Retailers Association has spent $2.9 million since 1998 to lobby Congress on issues affecting its members. An EPA spokesperson told the Statesman on Friday that the agency has not amended its rules and continues to require enhanced reporting from fertilizer blenders.West Fertilizer, which the association says is not a member of the group, has been fined for lax compliance with similar planning requirements.The EPA fined the plant $2,300 in 2006 after inspectors found that the company had failed to update its risk management plan in a timely manner.And the company’s most recent risk management plan, filed in 2011, drastically underestimated a “worst case” incident at the plant, stating that it would be a 10-minute leak of anhydrous ammonia, not the catastrophic explosion that occurred Wednesday night, for which the death toll — reported to be at least 14 as of Friday evening — is still not finalized.Enjoy Free Access now through June 10Get Access
