But I used the recharger cable for the rechargeable battery packs back then. Of course the cables only fucking worked for 2 months usually so that was all they were really good for.

I stormed around with an MP or an UMP and cleaned house for minutes at a time.

I despised the campers also, but I really miss the "parkour," like on Afghan getting onto the plane wing and then jumping onto those ledges. There was nothing like that in 3.

It saw Sovereign land on that spire-ish thing on the citadel and saw his potential to rise to glory through using that plant to open the portal to darkspace, ensuring the return of the roaches.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (594)SR shutdown fallout discussion.  by  bassandlightsin  SilkRoad[+]lethal1ty -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]lethal1ty -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoThose substances impact more than just the user. People on meth have this nasty tendency to hurt other people. For others to suffer because you think that people have the right to selfishly do whatever they want is morally wrong. 
Guess what, we also "violently" ban murder and theft. But hey, YOLO right? It's their choice to murder people and steal shit. Why don't we let them do that while we're at it? We have a ban on graffiti, but hey they just want to express themselves. Why not let them draw dicks on other peoples' property? We have a "violent" ban on drunk driving. Again, YOLO right?

I saw the thumbnail of a guy driving with a side-facing camera and thought for sure that it would be one of those douchebags trying to "educate people on their rights." glad to be wrong.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (73)SR shutdown fallout discussion.  by  bassandlightsin  SilkRoad[+]lethal1ty -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]lethal1ty -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoNo, I am not joking. Please point to me where I am wrong. Marijuana is one thing, but if you are really going to tell me that meth, bath salts, and rack should be legal then I demand you prove to me that they are not a threat to public health.
I tell you what, let's make another analogy. Homes used to be built with asbestos and lead paint, both of which caused a number of health problems for those living in them and occassionally people living near them. Should we allow people to build homes like this anymore? I mean, it's their choice right?
Furthermore, people already attack other people with drugs. Slipping X into someone's drink for a night of fun. You do realize that once you make these substances easier to obtain and legal to carry that it will become an epidemic right?

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1992)SR shutdown fallout discussion.  by  bassandlightsin  SilkRoad[+]lethal1ty -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]lethal1ty -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoI believe that you and I both know that to be bogus. The people who grow marijuana do so in places where it is legal. They kill each other because without competition, the can raise prices and push more product. It is far too lucrative to ever be peaceful.
Secondly, you do realize that many drugs make people do drugs end up doing violent things BECAUSE of the drugs, right? Are you really telling me that people should be allowed to do bath salts in the park? Also, no. Drugs will never be something cheap, so the poor who use them will still end up killing people to fuel their habit. On top of that, because drugs make you a less stable and valuable worker, they keep these people from climbing out of the gutters. A coke head will continue spending his money on coke despite a need for health care or clothing. You are basically advocating legalizing something that victimizes people.
You're advocating allowing people to poison themselves,  kill others or get themselves killed by doing stupid things. Such naivety, I have never heard it before.

That's why I chose not to use the word justice. It's pornworthy because we would get a sick sense of satisfaction, but satisfaction doesn't make it just.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (12)Texas Congressman Confronts Park Ranger Over Closed WWII Memorial  by  JCalientein  texas[+]lethal1ty -1 points0 points1 point 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]lethal1ty -1 points0 points1 point 3 days agoClearly you don't understand how elections work. Republicans and democrats, as the two most well known parties will ALWAYS take up the majority of votes when you have two strong parties, one will get 46% and the other will get 44%. In the meantime, that 3rd party will get 10%. But then you're throwing out the fact that there are more than 3 parties, so libertarians might get 6% while greens and socialists then get 2.
If you want to throw away your vote in the belief that a non mainstream party will win the popular vote, that's up to you. But many of us also see many of those 3rd parties as even worse than the current two. I'll take a democrat over a libertarian any day. While I am a green party member, I recognize that the strength of the green party is in its influence, not in it's ability to get elected. As for socialists...even I'm not that liberal.
