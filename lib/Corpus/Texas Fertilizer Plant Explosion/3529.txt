Lyrics:You ask how far the farthest star isTo go by bus or to go by car isWay too far, you couldn't sayYou won't get there anywayHe says it takes a private planeBut you could never get back to your feet againUnless you break the ball and chainHe says "Now, it's a private plane"With all these places in your mindThere's no reason you have to findYour private planeDon't play that game
