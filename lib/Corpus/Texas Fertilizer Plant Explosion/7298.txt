A video I made for the song Contact by The Cross from the album 'Shove It'. Written by Roger Taylor. Lyrics:Feeling strange, turn around, do it againFeeling alright, feel like contact tonightWell you know what it says and you know what you feelAnd you know what it's like and you know it's for realSo take it to the limit, take it to the heightTake it to the limit, contact tonightDon't speak, don't break the spellLet's dance, you dance so wellHeyI contact you, you contact meAcross the room our glances meetI contact youEye contact, eye contactFeeling fine, feel like dynamiteEyes speak more than words can saySparks fly, eye contact is madeWhen you know what it saysAnd you know what you feelAnd you know what it's likeAnd you know it's for realSo take it to the limit, take it to the heightTake it to the limit, contact tonightBreathe deep let your feelings showLet's dance, but not too slowI contact you, you contact meAcross the room our glances meetI contact youEye contact, eye contactTake it to the limit, take it to the limitEye contact (eye contact)(Eye contact) eye contactEye contact (eye contact)Eye contact (eye contact)Eye contact (eye contact)(Eye contact)Eye contact-----------------------------"Freddie Mercury" "Roger Taylor" "Brian May" "John Deacon" "Bohemian Rhapsody" "Don't Stop Me Now" "I Want It All" "Somebody To Love" "These Are The Days Of Our Lives" "We Will Rock You" "We Are The Champions" "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" "Fat Bottomed Girls" "Bicycle Race" "Play The Game" "A Kind Of Magic" "Innuendo" "Another One Bites The Dust" "Killer Queen" "You're My Best Friend" "Breakthru" "Body Language" "Under Pressure""Wembley" "I'm Going Slightly Mad" "Breakthru" "Barcelona" "Scandal" "The Miracle" "Radio Ga Ga" "Heaven For Everyone" "One Vision" "Hammer To Fall" "I Want To Break Free"
