Please post news items only, with the exception of meta posts about /r/news itself. Self-posts aggregating news data and "independent reporting" each count as news, but are not an excuse to editorialize.
Your post will likely be removed if it: 

is not news (or a meta post).
is an opinion/analysis or advocacy piece.
primarily concerns politics.
has a title not taken from the article.
has a pay wall or steals content.
covers an already-submitted story.
violates reddit's site-wide rules.

Your comment will likely be removed if it:

is racist, sexist, vitriolic, or overly crude.
is unnecessarily rude or provocative.
is a cheap and distracting joke or meme.
is responding to spam.
violates reddit's site-wide rules.

Extreme or repeat offenders will be banned.
