Elderly persons from a nearby nursing home are triaged in a parking lot before being moved to a school stadium following a fertilizer plant explosion Wednesday, April 17, 2013, in West, Texas. The explosion near Waco Wednesday night injured dozens of people and sent flames shooting high into the night sky, leaving the factory a smoldering ruin and causing major damage to surrounding buildings.

GENESEE COUNTY, MI – Instead of its original plan to deliver non-perishable items to the people affected by the West, Texas explosion that occurred at a fertilizer plant on April 17, a Genesee County-based emergency response team has a new focus.The Unified National Emergency Response Team – a volunteer organization in the Flint area – said that the mayor of West sent out a press release saying that the victims and the families affected by the disaster are no longer in need of items such as clothing, food, water, baby care items, batteries, flashlights and medical items.Steve Major, chief of the UNERT organization, said that the mayor is now asking people for monetary donations to help support the victims.“(West’s mayor) put out a press release and we’ve had someone in contact with the emergency operations center down there,” Major said.“We’ve changed it up so that we’re just doing a cash drive because they’re only looking for (monetary) donations. We won’t be going down there now, but we’re still supporting them in whatever way we can.”Major said that plans to hold an emergency relief drive will still happen from Friday, April 19, through Sunday, April 21, at the Suski Chevrolet Buick Automotive Dealership located at 8700 Main St. in Birch Run, but asks that monetary donations be brought instead of items.“Any goods that people bring, we’ll make sure they go to a good cause. If they bring things that we can use for disasters, we’ll use them for the relief efforts that we have in the future or we’ll send the items to a local charity,” Major said.“We are definitely in need of medical supplies for our team for future disaster response efforts and we’re totally volunteer and nonprofit based, so anything we receive goes back into helping people.”
