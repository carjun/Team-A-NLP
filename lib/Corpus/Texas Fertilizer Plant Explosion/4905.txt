If true, will most Americans hold President Obama responsible?YesNoUndecidedOtherView resultsWEST, Texas (AP) — On the first Sunday after a fertilizer  plant explosion leveled part of this tiny Texas town, the Rev. John Crowder  stood atop a long flatbed overlooking a hayfield and spoke to his  congregation.Mr. Crowder’s First Baptist Church in West remains  blocked off as investigators work on the scene of Wednesday’s blast, which  killed at least 14 people and injured 200. So about 100 people sat in  white folding chairs Sunday morning, while others carried their own.“We  have lost our friends and neighbors,” Mr. Crowder told the audience. We  have lost the safety and comfort of our homes. But as scary as this is,  we don’t have to be afraid.”Authorities have not yet identified  what caused the blast, which was so powerful it registered as a small  earthquake. Assistant State Fire Marshal Kelly Kistner said the blast  left “a large crater.”The explosion destroyed about 50 homes and  severely damaged a nursing home and other buildings nearby. Fire Marshal Kistner said  all fires have been extinguished at the explosion scene and the  remaining fertilizer tanks at West Fertilizer Co. are not a danger.Some of the people who attended Sunday’s outdoor service wore T-shirts calling on others to “pray for West.”“Every  time I close my eyes, all I can think about is the explosion,” said Edi  Botello, a senior at West High School. “People running around. People  evacuating. There was one point I couldn’t even talk. I just stuttered.”The destruction was evident in a short visit to the area organized for reporters.An  apartment building just across the railroad tracks from the plant  appeared to bear the brunt of the explosion, according to a pool report.  The building’s roof was collapsed, its windows were blown out, and  chunks of concrete from the plant littered the space between the tracks  and the apartments.“Several blocks we had projectiles or shrapnel  that has been found of different sizes,” Fire Marshal Kistner said. “Smaller pieces  have been found blocks away.”The wave radiating from the blast  also hit the nursing home across the street from the apartments. There,  too, windows were blown out, ceiling tiles were visible throughout the  rooms, and the red brick exterior was cracked. At West Intermediate  School, a northern wall was charred and the southern wall showed  structural damage.Crews from Union Pacific were repairing the  railroad tracks, but reporters were kept from climbing the berm to see  what was happening at the fertilizer plant. Above the berm, four heavily  damaged metal structures were visible at the plant.More than 60  people are working in the blast zone for the federal Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the state fire marshal’s office.Fire Marshal Kristner  said officials have found the seat, or center, of the explosion, “which  is important, because as we conduct our investigation, we’ll be working  from an outer perimeter inward, from the least damaged to the greatest  damage. So knowing the seat of that explosion is important.”Robert  Champion, the special agent in charge for ATF’s Dallas office, said  experts plan to get into the crater in the next couple of days and start  digging it out “to see what transpired to cause this devastation.”Story Continues →View Entire Story‹‹ previous12next ››Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
