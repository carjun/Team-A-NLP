This was one of them. The other two were 1-0 vs LA and 4-3 vs RSL. All decided by last minute headers. I've been pretty lucky.

What was so great though was we didn't have to rely on those every game. 
Satyr was taken out because it was underwhelming and at times was a liability.

Sadly for me this was also when Phil realized he wanted to play the deck instead of let me borrow it. we bumped the fanatic from 3 to 4 and added a 1 of hammer. Hammer seemed a little slow for the deck so we moved it to sideboard. 
With 1 open slot we settled on chainwalker because its another card for emissary and still helped with the aggression 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (131)Check out my Power Metal band  by  Carlos8in  PowerMetal[+]mushmancat 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago  (0 children)[–]mushmancat 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agoPretty promising start. Reminds me of Power Quest.  Although, the opening guitar work sounds almost like you snagged Piterelli's solo from Christmas Canon Rock and sped it up.

But I was thinking about the times when I want to talk about something besides power metal.  Like i've been revisiting Quintessence/Empiricism era Borknagar and want to talk about how amazing they are.  Sure, I could go to /r/metal, but I don't get the sense of small community I get from this place.
