edit - 4 quick downvotes. just saying its really dumb to make a number 2 option a high volume, inefficient scorer. Melo and Chris Paul together, great. Melo and D12, great. but a LBJ Melo team now would not even be as good as miami is now

It is absurd how large he is. He is NOT 325. He is in the 350 range at least. Possibly 360.

Or Jesse to be killed. The ending was predictable by normal standards, but unpredictably predictable by BB standards.
