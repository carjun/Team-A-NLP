Molly is a darling beagle mix that is about 2 years old and 20 pounds. She came in with her friend, Radar who is a Beagle mix as well and is probably around 2 also. They cameÂ  from an owner in the South that could no longer keep them. They are both a bit shy, but super sweet and warm up quickly. It would be great if they could find a forever home where they could stay together, but getting them a forever family to love them is the most important thing, so it would be fine to separate them. Molly and Radar are a great medium size, and walk well together on their leashes. Twice the love!Adopt- Molly and Radar
