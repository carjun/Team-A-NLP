I'm currently at work at the front desk of a hotel in College Station, TX, and I just had a guest check out 2 days early and sprint to his car to head over there. Apparently it's his hometown and he's going to see what he can do to help.

There were many unfortunate effects of the explosion.  It affected many residents and effected damage to many buildings.

It looked like a mushroom cloud from Waco, it was terrifying.

permalinksaveparent[+]AtomicKetchup[S] 12 points13 points14 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]AtomicKetchup[S] 12 points13 points14 points 5 months agoAgreed. It was in a fertilizer plant after all. Apparently a "large swath of the town of West, Texas was 'leveled' in the explosion"

permalinksaveparent[+]DBZMerciter2005 7 points8 points9 points 5 months ago* (0 children)[–]DBZMerciter2005 7 points8 points9 points 5 months ago*I'd find it difficult to be anything BUT an accident. Fertilizer contains ammonium nitrate which is a highly volatile chemical. It's not unlikely for the conditions to be ripe for an explosion, especially somewhere as dry as central Texas is right now.
Edited since the explosion didn't take place in Waco directly.

permalinksaveparent[+]ActsofRandom 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]ActsofRandom 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoIf this had happened at any other time, in any other place, I would say yes without hesitation.  Unfortunately, this plant is right next to Waco, Texas, and this week is the 20th anniversary of the siege there.  The date alone has historically inspired right-wing terrorist attacks, including the Oklahoma City bombing.  So while I hope this was an accident, the other factors involved leave me unwilling to write off the possibility of terrorism until we have more information.

Small community of about 2500 with a popular stop called the Czech Bakery where you can get the best Kolaches known to man. 
Heartbreaking to see an entire community leveled in an instant. 
I live 1.5 hrs away and will check in the morning to find out what help I can offer.

permalinksave[+]AtomicKetchup[S] 5 points6 points7 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]AtomicKetchup[S] 5 points6 points7 points 5 months agoI added that in there because when I first heard about the explosion I had heard it from guests at my hotel who are from the town affected and not the news and when I went searching for articles, I could not find any. I literally kept refreshing my Google News search for "West, TX explosion" until the first article appeared and then I posted that one. I don't know what I did wrong that someone beat me to it by thirty minutes, but that is why I included that in there.

permalinksaveparent[+]Hyperdrunk 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Hyperdrunk 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoSidetrack Pet Peeve of mine:
"Breaking" news is supposed to mean 1 of 2 things.... originally it meant that the news was sooooo important that TV stations would interrupt regularly scheduled programming in order to bring you the news immediately.
Later it changed and was used in a manner to mean "it just recently happened".  It was fresh news.
Now it seems to be used (not in this case, but in general) for shit that's 7 hours old.  It's no longer fresh, and you certainly aren't interrupting sporting events and prime time TV to talk about it.
