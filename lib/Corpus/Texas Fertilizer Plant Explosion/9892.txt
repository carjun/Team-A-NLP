Here in Texas of course we won't qualify for medicaid under it so ignore anything that talks about that. 
Here is the website For the health insurance marketplace if you need to get personal insurance because you can't get it through work, school, parents, etc.

You are technically supposed to be covered by medicaid if you are under the poverty line but because Texas refused to expand it you will be in a black hole limbo until someone figures out how to extend coverage to you. You are, however, exempt from the law which means you won't be fined for not having coverage. 

permalinksave[+]kimsoronery 8 points9 points10 points 1 day ago  (5 children)[–]kimsoronery 8 points9 points10 points 1 day agoThis is incorrect. If you are under 100% FPL, you qualify for Medicaid. Plain and simple. What are state refused to do is expand eligibility for Medicaid to those making up to 133% FPL. Those individuals are still eligible to enroll in the Marketplace and will receive subsidies to drastically lower their monthly premium. Source: I work for a large Medicaid HMO in Texas.

permalinksaveparent[+]maowsers93born and bred[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day ago  (4 children)[–]maowsers93born and bred[S] -2 points-1 points0 points 1 day agowell hell you know more than me. I'm just repeating what a friend of mine found who tried to enroll and didn't qualify for anything. I checked the calculator for her too and it came back as nothing. This is what it says:
"You will not be eligible for subsidies in the exchanges because your income is below 100% of the federal poverty level.". When she tried to enroll it told her the same thing. If she (or anyone else under the FPL) works with a navigator will it cover them??? 
Edit: A guy I know who lives in Wisconsin said the same thing happened to him when he tried to enroll. He is a student below the FPL. Regardless, is this just a glitch or something?

permalinksaveparent[+]kimsoronery 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]kimsoronery 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoBecause your friend is under 100% FPL, she is eligible to receive Medicaid. When she applies for insurance at healthcare.gov, she will be directed to sign up for Medicaid instead of enrolling in a Marketplace product. For your friend in Wisconsin, I would encourage him to apply for insurance provided by his university, if available. Those plans tend to be rather affordable and well-suited to the needs of a university student.

permalinksaveparent[+]maowsers93born and bred[S] 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago  (0 children)[–]maowsers93born and bred[S] 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoI agree with the insurance through the university thing. Not really sure why he hasn't done that. That is where I get my insurance. Thanks for the information!!! I'll pass it along.

permalinksaveparent[+]maowsers93born and bred[S] 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago  (0 children)[–]maowsers93born and bred[S] 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoI'm sharing what is coming up when people attempt to put their incomes into the calculator when they are below the FPL. Hence the link. Links to direct websites showing the response you get isn't false information. 

permalinksaveparent[+]firex726 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (4 children)[–]firex726 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoQuite surprised by the exemption. 
I wonder how they will eventually expand it. 

permalinksaveparent[+]maowsers93born and bred[S] 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]maowsers93born and bred[S] 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoI am too really. It seems that the people who need the coverage the most can't get it if they live in a state that refused to expand the medicaid. Though, the thought process might be that since they are exempt from the fine they are exempt from the subsidy. I think it is just a loop hole created by states that refused to expand the coverage or set up a state exchange. It'll likely be worked out in a few years. 
I know a few people who are just relieved that they don't have to worry about the new law and a few other people still that are disappointed they can't get coverage. It seems to be a grab bag. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Necoras 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]Necoras 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI suspect one of two things will happen. First the controversy will eventually die down in a decade or so, and the "Medicaid Gap" (a term I think I just coined) will be filled. Or, so many people will be pissed off that they're being left out that enough non-far right people will be elected (either to the state congress or as Governor) that Medicaid will be expanded that way. 
Neither of these seems likely within the next year or so. Despite the Republican party's best efforts, the law isn't likely to go anywhere. I fear that the poor in Texas will simply be left out for the foreseeable future.

permalinksaveparent[+]maowsers93born and bred[S] 5 points6 points7 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]maowsers93born and bred[S] 5 points6 points7 points 1 day agoEach state was left with the responsibility of expanding medicaid and coming up with their own exchange. Texas refused to participate at all in any of it. That is Texas's right legally so they have every right to do as they wish. 
However, it is worth noting that 25% of Texas's population is uninsured and 30% of Texas's female population is uninsured. That is a sizable number of people who don't have coverage who may not get any aid because of the poverty line short fall. I didn't realize until posting the information for this that this will likely become a huge campaign issue in future elections. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Necoras 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Necoras 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoIt was absolutely Texas' right to do so. That doesn't mean it was smart, fair, or just. Because it was none of those things, I suspect that we will soon end up with popular support for candidates who want to implement a medicaid expansion, and corporate support for those who don't. But even if there is an upwelling of popular support, it is very unlikely to show up by next fall. Maybe by 2016.

permalinksaveparent[+]I_say_nay_nay 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago  (4 children)[–]I_say_nay_nay 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoAh. So, for folks like me nothing changes. No healthcare at all. Glad to know I won't be fined for it, at least. Black hole limbo rules!! lol There is some great information here. Thanks for posting!

permalinksave[+]Moleculor 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]Moleculor 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoIf you want things to change, pressure your state representatives. They're the ones who chose to stick you in the black hole.

I've already crafted a letter and am letting it 'sleep' tonight. I'll do a final edit tomorrow then send it. I can't shake the feeling it won't do any good, though. :(

permalinksave[+]maowsers93born and bred[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]maowsers93born and bred[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoThe sites are apparently crashing because there is a shit ton of traffic. Just try again over a week span or so. It is like a rush on the bank so to speak with people trying to get covered. If you still can't figure it out here is the free help line and here is a link that will point you in the direction of a navigator. Keep in mind Texas just said that the navigators have to have 40 more hours of training than they were originally supposed to have so some might not be up and running for another week. There is a lot of help for you, it will just take some time because all of humanity is trying to contact them right now ..... in all reality about 25% of the Texas population is, so it is going to take a hot minute to get through.

1 week for now: Did we say 40 hours? We meant 80.

permalinksaveparent[+]sangjmoon 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (3 children)[–]sangjmoon 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI found out the plans are great if you are self employed and make over $150,000. You have more options to save even more money although I don't think it was intended to help those who make that much or more.
