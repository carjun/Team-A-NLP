Instead of saving to the hard drive you save to the USB.  If you take out the USB then you don't keep your save on the Xbox.   The USB is how most people can "mod" their Xbox.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1)I can't trust anyone.  by  [deleted]in  whatsbotheringyou[+]LookAwayPuhlease 6 points7 points8 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]LookAwayPuhlease 6 points7 points8 points 1 month agoIt's just.  I just lie to everyone and mask my emotions to keep others from seeing how miserable I really am.  I always try to help others with what they need and they just take advantage.  I can't trust my girlfriend who goes to see her "friend".  And it's really her ex she is seeing behind me.  I can't trust my friends because all they really want is money.  Even when people vent to me and I talk them through things they always seem to forget later on.   Now I just act everything.  I hide all my emotions.   I cover them up with fake ones.  I don't want to kill myself.  No.  I just want to make others happy while being happy myself.   I don't know what to do.

This goes for anyone in general  by  aedansblade36in  AdviceAnimals[+]LookAwayPuhlease 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]LookAwayPuhlease 2 points3 points4 points 1 month agoMy dad never said anything unless I was about to fuck up.   He wouldn't even have to scream and I knew that I needed to fix what I was doing.  My mom on the other hand would gasp for breaths and freak the fuck out when I wasn't doing anything wrong.
