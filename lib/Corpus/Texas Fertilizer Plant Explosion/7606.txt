Why?  by  ThadeousCheeksin  Browns[+]relic2279 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago  (0 children)[–]relic2279 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoWe have some cushion on draft picks next year thanks to the trades during April's draft. I think we're decently set up come May no matter what our record. I say 8-8. It'll foster some much needed confidence in the new front office.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (40)Is moderator labor an issue on reddit?  by  alexleavittin  TheoryOfReddit[+]relic2279 9 points10 points11 points 7 days ago  (0 children)[–]relic2279 9 points10 points11 points 7 days ago
I'm not saying that it's bad to add features, but it's not true that it will encourage strictly better behavior.

Whether it encourages better behavior or not is irrelevant. Any feature or tool added, good or bad, has the potential for abuse. Like it or not, reddit is going to have bad mods. Why handicap the other 99.9% because of a few bad apples? Should we stop making hammers because a couple nutjobs might use them to smash someone's head in?
I think the "potential for abuse" should be the last thing to think about when implementing new tools, if at all. That entire thought process is borderline toxic because it shows a lack of trust in one's own community.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1161)What is Reddit?  by  SpoonOnGuitarin  videos[+]relic2279 -1 points0 points1 point 14 days ago  (0 children)[–]relic2279 -1 points0 points1 point 14 days ago
Just click on every mod account of this subreddit and look for green text (that's when a user assumes his moderator role to say something in his subreddit). You won't see much. 

/r/Videos mod here. Some of us are very active in this subreddit. Keep in mind that not all mods like to distinguish themselves. This is especially true in default subreddits because of the attention it can draw (to be frank, we're afraid of witch-hunts). Newbie or power-hungry mods like to do it for the attention, but when you've been around a while, you learn it's better to be seen and not heard. I actively avoid distinguishing myself. Using that as a gauge of activity is beyond inaccurate.

But we did win last year too, without the magnificent mammaries. I think our fanbase's loyalty and passion played a role as well.
