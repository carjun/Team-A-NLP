We all want to see someone suffer and die in prison. Take child harmers for instance... or terrorists, or like you said, the underclass. All of these groups are targeted for the harshest sanctions we can apply. What we fail to realize is that once we open the door to draconian sanctions for anyone at any time for any reason, we have opened ourselves up to the inevitable mission creep that eventually sees the harsh sanctions that were at first reserved for the worst offenders, become available to anyone and everyone.

I think for myself, thank you very much.  And the GOP is 100% responsible for this shutdown.  The evidence is clear and overwhelming.  Sorry for those who vote Republican, but facts are facts, and we can't let "rooting for the home team" blind us.
Don't "believe" anything, or anyone!  As Terence McKenna once said, the truth does not require your belief.

I didn't read her argument but at least she's trying to maintain dignity of work and earn her own way instead of going on the dole.
and isn't the utopia of capitalism to drive the marginal cost of labor to zero? I guess that's great if you're in the capitalist class, but what do we do for everyone else?

She outgrows things so fast right now it doesn't make sense to drop a lot of cash on something she will wear a couple of weeks. If we are talking about top of the line name brand shoes brand new then we are talking $150-$200. Honestly,  some people don't get that the expansive name brands are not the only option. Even though I could afford to do it, I will reserve spending that kind of money on a purchase my kid really needs and/or will use for longer.

Congress still being paid and provided with gym.  by  Bigbrotherxpin  news[+]ghibliblog [score hidden] 3 minutes ago  (0 children)[–]ghibliblog [score hidden] 3 minutes agoYes.  The House Republicans shut down the government.  They bragged and boasted about it for years, they campaigned in 2010 on it, and the incoming Tea Party caucus demanded that John Boehner and the House leadership do it.  The House Republicans are absolutely, 100% responsible for the government shutdown
There was an excellent article in Sunday's New York Times about the GOP and wealthy, influential figures (including Regan alumni Ed Meese the Koch Bros and various organizations), pushing for a government shutdown to blackmail Obama into defunding or recinding the ACA.  I highly recommend reading that, but it's no surprise to anyone who follows politics.
Also Recommended: "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."  Still the best movie about American politics.  Apart from "The Godfather," of course.
There are plenty of times to criticize Democrats and blame both parties for failing this country.  But the shutdown (and debt ceiling crisis) is not one of them.

Furthermore you pester your politicians endlessly until they take care of it, and if not you vote your local officials out of office. Then it's not political suicide (locally anyways) and you are justified in your decisions
