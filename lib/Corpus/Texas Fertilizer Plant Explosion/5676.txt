permalinksavecontextfull comments (207)People of Reddit, are there more chairs or people in the world?  by  cmoneys905in  AskReddit[+]BloodyEjaculate 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago  (0 children)[–]BloodyEjaculate 0 points1 point2 points 9 days agowhile it would be reasonable to assume that the number of chairs in the world is more or less equal to the number of people able to sit in those chairs at any given moment, we should consider that chairs are a constant function whilst the number of people able to sit in them is variable at all times. Chairs are proportional not to the amount of people able to sit in them at one given moment in time, but to the maximum capacity for sitting which exists indepdenent of linear time and encompases an infinity of different seating situations; wherever it is possible for sitting to occur, there can be a chair, regardless of whether it is in use in that or any other moment in time. therefore we can conclude that the number of chairs in the world represents a maximum boundary for all present and future possibilities of sitting, and that the human population at a single moment in time could not possibly occupy all available seats in the world.
