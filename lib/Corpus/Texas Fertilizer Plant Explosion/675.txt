After the explosion at the West Fertilizer Co. last week that killed more than a dozen people, The Dallas Morning News and several other news organizations sought information from the Office of the Texas State Chemist.Among the records sought were state inspection reports from the West facility, and any occurrences of fines or regulatory violations. The News also asked for a list of businesses in Texas that sell or store ammonium nitrate, the material believed to have exploded in West. The newspaper hoped to let readers know if any other such stockpiles existed near schools, apartment buildings and nursing homes, as was the case in West.On Monday, the Texas A&M University System, which houses the state chemist’s office, appealed the release of those records. In its appeal to the Texas attorney general’s office,, A&M’s general counsel said, “We believe a portion of the requested information is confidential and excepted from disclosure.”A copy of the letter to the attorney general was sent to The News by A&M, but much of it was redacted. That’s because, in the A&M lawyer’s words, “our arguments reveal the substance of the information requested.”The A.G. now has 45 business days to render an opinion on whether the records should be released.
