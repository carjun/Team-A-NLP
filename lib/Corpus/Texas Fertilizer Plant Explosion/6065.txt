Ranger is doing her job. Unlike that POS congressperson.

The problem is not what she is doing. She is doing what she was told and the congressperson looked like a jackass because he is part of the machine that closed down the park. Not her.
Why did he close the park and tell those folks they could not enter eh?
Pass a budget, stop acting like children.

Obama and Reid are as much to blame as anyone for the shutdown.  Stop pretending they did nothing to cause this, they acting no different than the GOP right now.

I noticed how you entirely took this to a partisan problem. I never once said anything about the repubs or democrats.  Funny how you did that an ignored the issue here. A congressperson grandstanding and looking a fool for something he caused.

"How dare you act as we have decided you should act?"
Scumbag congressman: works towards shutdown, berates gov't employees for actually shutting down.

Texas, I swear if you don't get your shit together and start voting ............ I just can't, I can't take another election cycle of being the lowest voter turnout in the nation resulting in embarrassment representation.

permalinksaveparent[+]BeartrapSandwich 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours ago  (4 children)[–]BeartrapSandwich 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours agoPlease tell me we're not gearing up behind the Democrats. I know they're the lesser of two evils, but I'm tired of having to settle for evil. 

permalinksaveparent[+]lethal1ty 2 points3 points4 points 10 hours ago  (3 children)[–]lethal1ty 2 points3 points4 points 10 hours agoSigh, unfortunately it can't be helped. Throwing votes away in third parties only creates a vacuum of votes that could have gone to the less evil party. We can vote for moderate democrats, but that's about it. I'd be in favor of moderate republicans but there are already too many in power who make that dangerous.
Also, unfortunate as it is, that is the nature of the world. Evil is everywhere. According to some people, I'm evil and according to some people you are evil, even of those people only speak in generalizations.

permalinksaveparent[+]BeartrapSandwich 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago  (0 children)[–]BeartrapSandwich 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours agoI fear you're right.
Unfortunately, moderate democrats are still far too right-leaning for my tastes. It'd be great to get an actual democratic-socialist party or  Nordic-model social-democratic party, but our first-past-the-post, privately financed elections make that pretty unlikely. 

permalinksaveparent[+]coldcupofjoe -1 points0 points1 point 8 hours ago  (1 child)[–]coldcupofjoe -1 points0 points1 point 8 hours agoIt's not throwing away your votes! The only way to beat the two party system is to vote in a third party! It doesn't even matter who libertarians, communists, sepratists, whatever! Start voting in these other parties and we'll get there. It's the only way to beat this bullshit!

permalinksaveparent[+]lethal1ty 0 points1 point2 points 37 minutes ago  (0 children)[–]lethal1ty 0 points1 point2 points 37 minutes agoClearly you don't understand how elections work. Republicans and democrats, as the two most well known parties will ALWAYS take up the majority of votes when you have two strong parties, one will get 46% and the other will get 44%. In the meantime, that 3rd party will get 10%. But then you're throwing out the fact that there are more than 3 parties, so libertarians might get 6% while greens and socialists then get 2.
If you want to throw away your vote in the belief that a non mainstream party will win the popular vote, that's up to you. But many of us also see many of those 3rd parties as even worse than the current two. I'll take a democrat over a libertarian any day. While I am a green party member, I recognize that the strength of the green party is in its influence, not in it's ability to get elected. As for socialists...even I'm not that liberal.

permalinksave[+]sangjmoon  comment score below threshold  (8 children)[–]sangjmoon -12 points-11 points-10 points 20 hours agoIf the parks were really shut down, they wouldn't have funding to have rangers put up the fences and guard them. The park and monuments would be just left unattended with doors, if any, locked. What the federal agencies who pull this kind of maneuver are doing is trying to say "Hey! I'm worth the huge amounts of tax dollars you spend on me although if you look closely, you would see most of the money is wasted in our agency."
I speak unfortunately from experience from within the federal and two state governments.

Sounds like a vandal's dream. I'd prefer that our parks and monuments not be easy targets for thugs while the politicians have their silly spat.

permalinksaveparent[+]sangjmoon  comment score below threshold  (6 children)[–]sangjmoon -12 points-11 points-10 points 19 hours agoImagine if people guarded the monuments and cleaned them without the need of park rangers. And what if we really took a close look at the budget of these and other federal agencies wondering why they are so expensive when we don't really need them that much.

permalinksaveparent[+]TheRighteousTyrantborn and bred 6 points7 points8 points 19 hours ago  (3 children)[–]TheRighteousTyrantborn and bred 6 points7 points8 points 19 hours ago

Ha. Haha. Hahaha! Have you even been to a park? This could happen now . . . it doesn't. Hell, do you even use public restrooms? Some people can't bother themselves to so much as flush a toilet, and you want people to care for entire parks themselves? 
Also, just how expensive is the park service? I bet we could fund it for years by just cutting out, say, the F35 boondoggle.

permalinksaveparent[+]lethal1ty 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours ago  (0 children)[–]lethal1ty 1 point2 points3 points 16 hours agoAlso, some people, particularly from further south, have this nasty tendency of wiping their ass and then leaving the toilet paper in a corner on the floor.

permalinksaveparent[+]sangjmoon  comment score below threshold  (1 child)[–]sangjmoon -9 points-8 points-7 points 19 hours agoYou assume that money cut from the F35 would be redirected elsewhere. Unfortunately, the federal government doesn't work that way. They create the expenses and then when they realize they spent far more than the tax revenues they receive as expected, they sell debt to cover the difference.
Because there is no driver to keep costs down in the government, every agency is basically a Jabba the Hutt of varying sizes. Every agency wastes money and their primary goal is to make sure they get at least the same amount of money during the next budget cycle regardless of whether they really need it or not.

permalinksaveparent[+]TheRighteousTyrantborn and bred 5 points6 points7 points 19 hours ago  (0 children)[–]TheRighteousTyrantborn and bred 5 points6 points7 points 19 hours agoYou've described a problem with a budgeting method, not a problem that is exclusive to or necessarily a part of government (gov't could use a budgeting method that doesn't assume all of last year's expenses were necessary and proper). 
You also didn't answer the question.
