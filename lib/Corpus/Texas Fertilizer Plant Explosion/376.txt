            German composer Uwe Reckzeh´s passion for classic EM started in the early seventies with albums from Kraftwerk, Jean Michel Jarre and Tangerine Dream. In 1980 he started to experience with his first own synthesizers from Moog and Korg. Disappointed by his first results caused by limited production possibilities, he took a time-out, which ended some years later by the upcoming midification. Thrilled by new technical possibilities, Uwe, Susi Vering (Gesang) and Karsten Loos produced the CD´s "Trance Meditation" and "Universe" under the name "Project" in the early 90s. In 1997 he started his own musical career as a soloist by releasing his album "Behind the Northern Wasteland". The albums "Cosmic Water" 2002, "Timecode" 2003, "Point North" 2005 und "Altitude 30000" 2006 followed. Since January 2008 all albums are available at the label MellowJet-Records. Uwe Reckzeh´s music is assigned to the traditional EM, which he transported into the 21st century like hardly anybody."Themes from Iceland "is from his cd "Virtual Minds". ( 2013 )Uwe is moderator of the German radioshow „Atmosphere" every first and third Thursday at 21:00 on air.or via Live-Stream at http://www.Radiowaf.dehttp://www.facebook.com/#!/...http://www.mellowjet.de/http://www.facebook.com/Mel...
