FL Studio

Play 


      FL Studio is the most complete virtual studio currently available. It will play any sample file (wav), softsynth, VSTi, DXi or midi instrument you feed it. One of the most exciting aspects about (the online version) of FL Studio is that all updates are FREE for LIFE!

TL Audio | Passionate About Tubes

Play 


      TL Audio began manufacturing audio products in 1990. The first TL Audio products were original Neve EQ modules, which were taken principally from broadcast consoles and re-packaged to make them suitable for music production studios. Since then, TL Audio has expanded its product base and manufactures numerous high-end, mid-level, and entry level products that would suit any budget.
