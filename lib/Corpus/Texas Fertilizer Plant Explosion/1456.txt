The terror in that kids voice is moving.

I'd rather not have watched it just before bed.
The worse part is the dad can't reassure him because he can't hear the kid and vice versa.

This. Her voice is so chillingly terrified. I just want to jump into the video and tell her everything will be okay and make her feel safe.

You'll notice he doesn't respond to the kid.

permalinksaveparent[+]monkeytoes77 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago  (0 children)[–]monkeytoes77 0 points1 point2 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onThe most touching thing to me is that the father, though probably panicking himself, keeps it together for the kid.

That kid experienced some serious trauma. I guess the thrill of being so close to the fire was undeniable for the father.

We all have them -- you're going along ask "this is pretty cool"-like and then you realize you almost just died, and you had no idea you were in danger.

permalinksaveparent[+]videodays 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago  (0 children)[–]videodays 0 points1 point2 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onIt's that kind of fear where something happens to you that is not lethal but disabling and you wonder... will I be like this for the rest of my life?
I'm sure most people have had something like that on multiple occasions, very scary for sure.

permalinksaveparent[+]thekid_frankie  comment score below threshold  (1 child)[–]thekid_frankie -10 points-9 points-8 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onI attribute it to the kid overreacting as kids do. His ears were ringing so loud he flipped. He felt similar to how you feel when you knock the wind out of yourself for the first time. Not really scary or haunting because I don't feel like they were in immediate danger. I sounded the same first time I was at the bottom of a dog pile.

People are reporting feeling the effects of the blast up to 100 miles away. I'm pretty sure being within viewing distance was something special.
