This may be the one identifying factor if your phone is ever stolen and reset.  by  cyale4in  LifeProTips[+]LeastComicStanding 14 points15 points16 points 19 hours ago  (0 children)[–]LeastComicStanding 14 points15 points16 points 19 hours agoExactly my thought.
Seems like this should allow the "authorities" mentioned to be able to get the phones back to the original owners.  
If I have a copy of it, it should only serve as a backup or fail-safe in case my carrier doesn't.

From your comments, it looks like socially implanted concepts more than anything, which is good news because learning and self awareness can do wonders to reverse stigmas that have no business being there.  I wish I had some great resources to kick start your journey, but unfortunately I don't.  All I have are my words of moral support.  It's a wonderful life to feel free of other people's negative thoughts and ideas about your body. Love yourself and every single part of you, because every second that you live, you're absolutely perfect. You have to be, because there's no other way you can possibly be.

So do you get any kind of foul for crossing over the inner part of the track?
Can you bump, because after watching about 3 rounds, I really wanted you to "not slow down just enough" and execute a police maneuver on him in the turn.  I know, it's friendly competition, but I definitely got frustrated that you didn't fly right by him in the straight away after coasting behind him (like in Days of Thunder or Talladega Nights).  SHAKE AND BAKE!
Sponge seemed legit safety measure to me.  :-p  I have one of those on every vehicle I drive.

And it doesn't do anything, so I guess he was trying to show that it doesn't wash off, as if to prove it was just water and not some chemicals reacting on the car (i.e. a powder base dusted on the car prior and a liquid reactant in the jugs).  
Either way, I want to see the streaking effect of a cold spray, like driving in a cold rain, or cold water being sprayed horizontally from the front... to see if it resembles the airbrushed flames effect.
