Every time we push Snowden info to the front and not PRISM info, we continue to care more about the idol and not the message.  
Seriously reddit. Stop upvoting Snowden drama. It's political banter that is being done to allow the PRISM stuff to fade into darkness.

I kind of liked Shift as it didn't have too much of a F&F feel to it.

permalinksavecontextfull commentsWORST GAMING CONTROLLER  by  thefithbeatlein  gaming[+]random012345 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]random012345 -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoWhen I got my Macbook Air, I compared it to the exact same specs of equivalent Ultrabooks.  I bought my Air for ~$900, and the most equivalent (which also meant eliminating all of the plastic-feeling pieces of crap) was ~$1100.
For the most part, you get what you pay for with Apple computers.  There generally is a slight premium on the hardware, but its much sturdier and the support is much better.  Also, they hold their value and you can re-sell them when it comes time to getting a new one.  I've never owned a Windows laptop that I was ever able to sell for anything more than what you can consider 'Gamestop Prices'. Meanwhile, my friends with Macbooks have always been able to get a fair amount to go to their new Macbooks.

I still remember the huge amount of anger when Underground first came out and went from Ferraris, Lambos, and other extremely expensive exotic supercars to Japanese 'rice burners'.

The "they" though in most places I've been around the country can be local authorities who every so often like to be a dick and try to crack down on public drinking and such (especially in parks).  
As far as "cold", does it ever warm up to a relaxing temperature or is it always generally cold?

permalinksavecontextfull commentsA beer glass made to only stand up if placed on a cell phone  by  brewnevadain  beer[+]random012345 -1 points0 points1 point 7 days ago  (0 children)[–]random012345 -1 points0 points1 point 7 days agoI fucking hate bars that try to force certain social rules.  Fuck yes I go to bars and sit on my cell phone.  I like to go to bars alone and bullshit with people around me and the bartenders.  The thing is about random people and bullshitting is convos don't hold on nonstop for 3 hours and there's plenty of awkward silence.  Sometimes I just want to go to a bar to get out of my apartment, but still just be to myself.  
It's 2013.  Welcome. People have cell phones.  Get use to it.  If you go out with friends and they all sit on their cell phones and you don't like it, then maybe you should get new friends.  It's a new social norm.
The only thing worse than a bar with people on their cell phones is a bar that has social rules that makes me feel scared that I may break one.  The best bars are ones where people don't give a single shit about what you wear, what you say, how you look, or how you act (as long as you're not being a dick to others).
