 WEST, Tex. — Rescue crews in this small town spent Thursday searching for victims in the smoldering ruins of a liquid fertilizer depot and dozens of destroyed homes after an explosion caused an unknown number of deaths and injured more than 160 people.
Authorities early in the day estimated that five to 15 people had been killed. But later, they declined to specify the number of people missing or dead.

Fertilizer plant explodes in central Texas: A massive explosion on Wednesday night at a fertilizer plant in West, Tex., left more than 160 people wounded and killed an unknown number of people, officials said, likely including firefighters who had been battling the blaze at the factory that triggered the explosion. West is 20 miles north of Waco.

A fire at the West Fertilizer Co. appears to have ruptured high-pressure storage tanks full of liquid ammonia, which caused the huge blast. Several firefighters were missing. “Last night was truly a nightmare scenario in that community,” Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) said Thursday, adding, “This tragedy has most likely hit every family.” West, with 2,800 residents, is a flat farming community 20 miles from Waco, just off an interstate highway, with a smattering of antique shops and locally owned diners. It plays up its Czech heritage, and like many rural towns, it has a demographic profile tilting to the elderly.A day after the explosion, a large swath of the town was blocked to the public as emergency personnel continued to search for victims, picking through the rubble of collapsed homes and the flattened facility. The Red Cross set up a shelter at the town’s community center, which provided displaced families with basic supplies. Officials said there was no indication the fire was anything other than an accident, but they said they were examining all possibilities. “We are not ruling anything out,” said Waco Police Sgt. William Patrick Swanton, a police spokesman.Mayor Tommy Muska said 50 to 60 homes within a five-block radius of the storage depot were heavily damaged. West Rest Haven Nursing Home was being evacuated at the time of the blast because of its closeness to the fire. Its residents were all brought to a safe location, the mayor said.Muska, who is also a firefighter, told reporters that he was heading toward the fire when the thundering explosion occurred. “It blew my hat off,” he said, looking startled. “It blew the rearview mirror off my truck. It was a very powerful explosion.” Authorities were struggling Thursday to get a clear sense of the damage in West, in part because the explosion disrupted power and cellphone service to parts of the area.“We’re going house to house, business to business,” Swanton said at a news briefing. “I think we’re going to see fatalities increase.” The explosion, he said, “reached blocks, if not miles, in its devastating effect. There are homes leveled. There are businesses leveled.”The explosion “was massive, just like Iraq, just like the Murrah Building in Oklahoma,” D.L. Wilson, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, told reporters, referring to the April 19, 1995, bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. The federal government’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Chemical Safety Boar
d, which investigates industrial disasters, were sending teams.The cause of the fire is unknown. Courtney Adair, 20, a great-niece of the owner of the fertilizer distributor, said the family is in shock. “They don’t know what to think or what’s going to happen,” she said. She said the family can’t fathom that anyone would have set the blaze on purpose.
