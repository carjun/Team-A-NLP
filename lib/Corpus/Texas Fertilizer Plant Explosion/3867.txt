I'm glad the gun nuts blew each others' brains out. That's what happens when you're a gun nut.
You have the right to a gun, and you have the right to be worm food.

Awful hypocritical in what we're defining as 'legitimate.'
And don't tell me this community finds photoshopped images legitimate. The first 5 top comments are all criticizing the picture for this very detail.

Then why do people hate photoshop?
Using a fucked up camera that puts a giraffe on Uranus artificially is the exact same thing, only perhaps more difficult for difficulty's sake.
If that's the case, photoshop something only using your penis to touch the computer, and it deserves equal merit.

The giraffes in front of a moon that large would never be visible like that from the naked eye.

Are neo nazi's supposed to be antithetical to black people? I guess they are racist ---- but is a swastika an anti-black symbol in particular?
I'd have been more impressed if her dad was a Grand Wizard in the Klan.

You don't need to have founded Microsoft to accomplish this.
That's like climbing Mount Everest because you want to play in some snow.

Though they have oil reserves, they don't subsidize fuel and use the $ for free college education and national infrastructure  by  shavedcleanin  todayilearned[+]severus66 0 points1 point2 points 19 days ago  (0 children)[–]severus66 0 points1 point2 points 19 days agoYes but while this says the average US wage is $20.90 per hour, the MEDIAN US wage is only $15.95 per hour. The new calculation with the median wage is about 27.9 L/ per hour
If you live in a big city with higher gas prices like Chicago, your mileage may vary.

Were there just a pile of unfastened bricks in the back? ... Yeah, fuck that. I hate being near any large trucks while driving.

Here's my theory. Bitcoin are like Beanie Babies.
They're worth a ton! Nowhere to go but up! Until the emperor has no clothes and they're worthless junk again.

After seeing Tucker's "greatest movie ever made" movie --- yeah I don't trust him or his "crop."

permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)I make between $10,000-$15,000 a week from Social Media Advertising! AMA  by  cherrywinklein  Entrepreneur[+]severus66 4 points5 points6 points 21 days ago  (0 children)[–]severus66 4 points5 points6 points 21 days agoWho cares if it lasts forever.
If my math is right he's making at least $500K a year.
If it lasts two years, there's a million bucks. 
What does the average shmoe make in this country? 50k a year maybe? So what an average guy makes in 20 years, this guy makes in two.
As long as he invests that smartly, he definitely won't have to spend time at a shitty office job, bust his ass with physical labor, or any number of shit positions where you're being fucked by corporate America.

AMA  by  cherrywinklein  Entrepreneur[+]severus66 -1 points0 points1 point 21 days ago  (0 children)[–]severus66 -1 points0 points1 point 21 days agoWell, there is a correlation between money and talent, sure.
But there's also a strong correlation between money and health, money and interests, and money and one's importance placed on money.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (122)What's the stupidest thing someone's been mad at you for?  by  ZombieGoast5757in  AskReddit[+]severus66 -1 points0 points1 point 21 days ago  (0 children)[–]severus66 -1 points0 points1 point 21 days agoYou got it wrong. The guy who "has to be right, no matter what the costs" has the massive ego problem.
The guy who says "someone is wrong ... eh.... who gives a fuck" ... does not have a fragile "I like feeling smart" ego to protect and inflate.

Will the Voyager actually accomplish anything?
This announcement is like being proud of a fart, right? All noise and no real significance?


permalinksavecontextfull comments (3450)Vladamir Putin's Op-Ed in the New York Times on America and Syria  by  celloman369in  worldnews[+]severus66 -3 points-2 points-1 points 21 days ago  (0 children)[–]severus66 -3 points-2 points-1 points 21 days agoActually, fawning over Putin isn't default Reddit, making obvious statements like "Putin is a politician and he's trying to pull one over on us! He's an evil ex-KGB communazi!" is actually the far more common statement.
What about President Obama's speech? His was just as manufactured, if not MORE manufactured with artifice, than Putin's Op-Ed piece.
Putin is trying to persuade and manipulate you. So is NSA-spying, drone-flying, warmongering Obama.
And personally, even though Putin is obviously in favor of the Syrian government, I happen to agree that we have no business making war there to enrich a few cocksuckers at my tax dollars' expense.

Who's ACTUALLY holding all the inventory?
As someone who used to do inventory management, I'm a little confused.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1391)After 12 years of Michael Bloomberg, family homelessness has increased dramatically, rents skyrocketed and the minimum wage froze for the past six years  by  NYPDestrianin  politics[+]severus66 2 points3 points4 points 25 days ago  (0 children)[–]severus66 2 points3 points4 points 25 days agoI looked up cost of living comparison calculator. Allegedly 50k in Chicago is equal to 100k in the Manhattan part of New York City.
You can definitely make do, but probably without a car, unless very cheap, and probably an apartment with a roommate without its own parking space.
