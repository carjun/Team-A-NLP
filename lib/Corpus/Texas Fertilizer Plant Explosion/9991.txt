They don't have a confirmed number. I live right outside the town about five minutes away and it's pure chaos here.

Totally kidding, I sincerely hope nobody close to you was involved in the accident. This is a horrible tragedy.

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 177 points178 points179 points 5 months ago* (27 children)[–]HandShoes 177 points178 points179 points 5 months ago*A few relatives houses were leveled and my brother's girlfriend's dad was fighting the fire when it exploded but he's okay now. I don't believe anyone close to me was severely injured from what I have heard and I'm really grateful for that.

permalinksaveparent[+]THEUSERNAMETAKER 98 points99 points100 points 5 months ago  (8 children)[–]THEUSERNAMETAKER 98 points99 points100 points 5 months agoYou should really consider leaving the area for a while, that is, if you haven't already considered it....
According to /u/TheCynicalIdealist's comment here, the remnants of the chemicals are extremely toxic and dangerous. Good luck!

permalinksaveparent[+]whosthedoginthisscen 12 points13 points14 points 5 months ago  (6 children)[–]whosthedoginthisscen 12 points13 points14 points 5 months agoSeconded.  Don't wait for them to tell you in a couple of days that the air is toxic, go find a hotel somewhere for a couple three days.

That won't happen, what is this, Russia?

permalinksaveparent[+]what__year_is__this 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]what__year_is__this 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoThey've been mentioning concerns about air quality on the news already. Sounds like people that live downwind (to the north) are possibly being asked to shelter in place. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Shalaiyn 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Shalaiyn 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThe combustion of ammonium nitrate doesn't give "extremely toxic and dangerous" chemicals actually, luckily. The only thing will be the NOx, which still warrants caution, however, they carry an odour reminding one of chlorine, so if you smell chlorine, get the hell away.

permalinksaveparent[+]Homtamperish 14 points15 points16 points 5 months ago* (8 children)[–]Homtamperish 14 points15 points16 points 5 months ago*he was fighting the fire that sparked that explosion, and he's ok?
Edit: Was he hundreds of yards away from the fire he was fighting?  Idk much about firefighting.    

permalinksaveparent[+]kaneing 6 points7 points8 points 5 months ago  (6 children)[–]kaneing 6 points7 points8 points 5 months agoYeah...I can't imagine anyone being anywhere near that thing when it exploded and being "okay"

permalinksaveparent[+]c3bball 7 points8 points9 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]c3bball 7 points8 points9 points 5 months agopure luck? its amazing sometimes how people can be involved in the most ridiculous disasters and survive. Theres an acount in this wikipedia article of a stewardess surviving a free fall of 33,000 feet. Life is just really weird like sometimes.

permalinksaveparent[+]neurochild 5 points6 points7 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]neurochild 5 points6 points7 points 5 months agoEven if he was lucky enough to not get torn to shreds by the sheer force of the explosion and the fire, etc, there's no way he wouldn't be deaf. I don't consider that okay, lol. Even OP's son couldn't hear anything, and they were almost a mile away.

permalinksaveparent[+]The_Derpening 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]The_Derpening 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoYup. I saw a documentary about tornadoes once and they talked about a guy who was lifted and thrown miles away from his house which got absolutely destroyed, and he woke up hours later without so much as a sore muscle.

permalinksaveparent[+]MagicallyMalificent 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]MagicallyMalificent 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoAlso there was a guy less than 100yds from one of the nukes in Japan that survived. 

permalinksaveparent[+]yea-that-guy 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]yea-that-guy 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoHe could have been sheltered behind a thick wall, hopefully wearing ear protection.

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]HandShoes 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoI have no idea what he was doing. All I know is what my brother told my mom.

permalinksaveparent[+]elastic-craptastic 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]elastic-craptastic 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIf you are still just a few minutes away, please consider going farther as the smoke and chemicals may be dangerous.  You are lucky to have everyone you close to you accounted for, don't be the reason others have to worry.

permalinksaveparent[+]willywonka159 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]willywonka159 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoNot trying to sound rude, but he survived that enormous explosion while he was fighting the fire? Either he wasn't that close or it was a miracle.

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI'm not 100% clear on what he was doing. All I know is what my mom was told by my brother.

permalinksaveparent[+]willywonka159 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]willywonka159 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoGlad he's okay, nonetheless.

permalinksaveparent[+]octopornopus 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]octopornopus 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoThe important question on everyone's mind is: Is the Czech Stop still there? Are the kolaches safe?

permalinksaveparent[+]rainbowbarf 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]rainbowbarf 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoWere many people informed about the danger that building catching fire?

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]HandShoes 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoFrom what I've heard, this kind of thing is very rare. I don't think many people knew it was on fire until it actually exploded.

permalinksaveparent[+]Kutzie 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Kutzie 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI feel weird about the ads playing before the videos at a news site when they cover something like this. You know?

permalinksaveparent[+]communiqueso 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]communiqueso 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoplease give your account of what is going on

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoRight now, they're evacuating the north part of town and may have to evacuate the rest later because of the ammonia in the air. There's really not many more details so far.

permalinksaveparent[+]Kirsham 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]Kirsham 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoHow far away are you (in distance, not time)? I assume you felt and heard the explosion, could you describe the whole ordeal (what you felt, what you thought...)?

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]HandShoes 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI was at my friend's about 6 or so miles (he lives very close to me) away. We heard it and it sounded like something fell on the house so we went outside. His dad then told us the plant exploded and his mom's windshield had been blown out so we immediately jumped in the car to go see if she was okay, which she was. It was hard to see anything because the town was so chaotic so the extent of what I know is what I've seen on the news so far. It's really hard to believe something like this is happening just 5 or 6 miles away from me right now.

permalinksaveparent[+]Kirsham 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Kirsham 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoDamn, glad I'm not in your shoes right now, not to mention those hurt and killed. Stay safe.

permalinksaveparent[+]TheSalingerAngle 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]TheSalingerAngle 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoThey should have stayed vague on the number of dead and not even given an estimate. Of course, even if they said the number was between 1 and infinity, the media would run with "Infinity People Killed in Factory Explosion". Hasty social media updates aren't helping either.

permalinksaveparent[+]YourMomWorks4Me -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]YourMomWorks4Me -1 points0 points1 point 5 months agoI'm about half an hour away and everything is fine and dandy here... As if nothing has happened at all.

permalinksaveparent[+]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]HandShoes 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoEven five minutes away it's as if nothing happened. It's so weird.
