      Following a 4-day workshop in Martinique, Jaco Pastorius and Rashied Ali play a concert on December 14, 1984.Once released under the title Blackbird(while donning the silhouette of a pelican on the cover), the recorded performance has long been nearly impossible to find. Unfortunately the audio quality is not up to par.Student bassists Michel Hatzigeorgiou, Reno Steba, Alan Brennan, and Angel Vicens joins the duo at various times during the performance. Hatzigeorgiou guests on Donna Lee and Reno Steba is featured on Continuum, specifically.
