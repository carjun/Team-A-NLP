permalinksaveparent[+]JustMe8born and bred 5 points6 points7 points 12 hours ago  (3 children)[–]JustMe8born and bred 5 points6 points7 points 12 hours agoThere's one named New South Whales. I guess it was named that to get the Whaling ships to stop there.

Or is it British Columbia? It's one of those, pretty sure. Or wait, is that a city? Crap.

permalinksaveparent[+]mutatronborn and bred 12 points13 points14 points 16 hours ago  (2 children)[–]mutatronborn and bred 12 points13 points14 points 16 hours agoI like how he asks why we have so many states, when Australia has fewer people than Texas.

The city is smaller than DFW even with the suburbs. It was then that it dawned on me that Australia may be nearly the same size as the continental US, but their population is much, much smaller.

permalinksaveparent[+]GoingGone83 7 points8 points9 points 12 hours ago  (4 children)[–]GoingGone83 7 points8 points9 points 12 hours agoAh, I think it's kind of weird he randomly pulled "Missoula" out of his ass. A city in Montana with a 50k or so population? Was this is a movie or something?

I'd not even know one. I'd just write Australia on it and be done.
