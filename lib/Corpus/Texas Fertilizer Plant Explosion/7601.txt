permalinksavecontextfull comments (8)Sorry for the rant, but I'm starting to hate this site due to the insane amount of racism.  by  Whyihatedissitein  TwoXChromosomes[+]BritishEnglishPolice 4 points5 points6 points 4 days ago  (0 children)[–]BritishEnglishPolice 4 points5 points6 points 4 days agoHello, mod of a few subreddits here. I completely agree with you, and the amount of bigotry on this sub is partly owing to the anonymity allowing assholery (AAA), and partly also to outside organisations such as Stormfront watching potential threads and invading us. A few of the defaults I help run have strict comment and posting guidelines on the subject of racism, sexism and such, and if you check those out, we applaud those who come forward or even those who just click the little 'report' button so they show up in our modqueue. 
/r/wtf is a very heavy hive as is /r/videos, especially when black people are featured in the image/video.
