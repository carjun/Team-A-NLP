The nation's deadliest industrial accident happened in April 1947 in Texas City, Texas - killing more than 500 people.


Texas has experienced the thick smoke plumes and twisted carnage before.The images emerging from Wednesday's fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas are reminiscent of the Texas City disaster - an April 16, 1947 explosion that killed more than 500 people.That tragedy involved a ship filled with ammonium nitrate fertilizer. A fire broke out, and crew members - who didn't want to ruin the cargo with water - decided to suppress the flames by fastening the ship's hatches, keeping oxygen from fueling the flames.



But due to the ammonium nitrate, the fire didn't need oxygen. The flames grew and eventually a massive explosion occurred, turning the town into instant debris - and sending a shock that was felt 250 miles away, according to the Moore Memorial Public Library in Texas City. A second explosion occurred the next morning, causing further damage for the devastated area.The Texas City disaster remains the nation's deadliest industrial accident. Now, nearly 66 years to the day, another industrial tragedy has befallen Texas - leaving another community leveled, shocked, devastated.
