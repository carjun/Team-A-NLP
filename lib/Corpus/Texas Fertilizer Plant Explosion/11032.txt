(CNN) -- A massive explosion ripped through a fertilizer plant in the town of West, Texas, Wednesday night, sending scores of injured to area hospitals, sparking fires and triggering evacuations.
WHAT'S NEW 
-- "It was like a nuclear bomb went off," West Mayor Tommy Muska said.
-- Some 10 to 15 buildings have been "totally demolished" and "probably 50 homes (were) heavily damaged," said George Smith, community emergency medical services director.
-- The fertilizer plant was near an apartment complex and a nursing home, authorities said.
-- Some people might be trapped in collapsed buildings, Smith said.
-- "I expect there's going to be many fatalities and many more injured people," he added.
-- State troopers in gas masks set up roadblocks, waving away cars coming off the highway

-- More than 60 patients were received Wednesday night, hospital CEO Glenn Robinson said, with victims suffering from "blast injuries, orthopedic injuries (and) a lot of lacerations. While some of the injuries are minor, others are "quite serious."
-- A number of nearby residents were being evacuated because of the possibility of another explosion, officials said.
