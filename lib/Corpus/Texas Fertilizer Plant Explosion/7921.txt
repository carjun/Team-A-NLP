Or would thatbe absolutely not allowed?  by  Witness11bin  CombatFootage[+]hortus_guy 69 points70 points71 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]hortus_guy 69 points70 points71 points 2 days agoAs a combat vet who saw lots of small arms action, I often find commenting here uncomfortable. There are so many folks who have never actually seen combat but are good at story telling who make commenting on videos seem extra challenging because they provide entertaining answers which get highly upvoted while those of us who try to provide real answers often get downvoted. It's hard to explain, but I often find myself deciding that it's not worth the effort to try to explain some of problems I see in popular comments in this sub.

That and the fact that a lot of your food is contaminated with poison.
So you better find a source of safe water and switch to a diet of sprouts.


permalinksavecontextfull comments (55)9 super easy lunches (or dinners) for about $5.00  by  seamusseamusin  Cheap_Meals[+]hortus_guy 5 points6 points7 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]hortus_guy 5 points6 points7 points 3 days agoYou could take it a step further and make the beans yourself from dried. A $1 can of beans is has about 300 calories, but a 1 pound bag of dried beans for the same price has 1300 calories. All you need is some salt and garlic powder. Onion and oil/lard/bacon fat are optional. If you don't have a stove then a crock pot makes an excellent bean cooker and beans store really well in the freezer. I love beans!

I lived 1.9 miles from where all the schools were clustered in my town so starting in 5th grade I had to ride my bike to get to and from school. When my siblings got older I had to walk with them. I walked a lot growing up!

The only way I can see this happening is if you are trying to stop one guy from ghost capping a point and he is a total noob. Sounds boring.

I've been eating MP's for 12+ years and only ever seen them sliced at the TB I started eating at about 6 months ago. Even there it's only a 1/3 chance that they slice it. I tried looking up my states health code (texas) but could not find anything about pizza cutter tools. That's got to be it, though.

I'm not sure how to put it into quote format on my phone, but that's what he said when asked yesterday about diplomatic alternatives for dealing with Syria. Well done Mr. Kerry!
