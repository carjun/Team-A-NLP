It's been open for a while now, and our team actually won the state championship the year it opened.
Before this stadium, our high school football team had been using a VERY old football field that had to have "temporary" bleachers installed in order to accommodate the number of people showing up (it was a rickety death trap waiting to happen). Given the popularity of Allen's football games, the new stadium was long overdue, and the structure actually contains training facilities for various other school sports as well (from what I'm told) -- so it's not just about the football.

Can't hate.

permalinksave[+]RVelts 3 points4 points5 points 20 hours ago  (1 child)[–]RVelts 3 points4 points5 points 20 hours agoThe only thing that annoys me about this is that Allen took a lot of money from Plano years ago (10-15+ maybe, the Robin Hood program) when Plano had too much and Allen had too little. However, Allen has developed to be much better recently and Plano could use a new stadium now. Allen got a lot of new things in a quick timespan, while Plano actually could use some improvements.
Source: Attended Plano from K-12 in many of those years.

permalinksave[+]PurpleNuggets 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago  (0 children)[–]PurpleNuggets 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours agoAs did I. It really frustrated me to play against teams that we allegedly gave money to via Robin Hood who had really nice college-style jerseys with their names on the back when all we had were glorified practice jerseys that were 10 years old

permalinksaveparent[+]Ranosteelman 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours ago  (5 children)[–]Ranosteelman 4 points5 points6 points 18 hours agoYeah, what a bunch of horse shit. I went to this school and I hated it. They refuse to build a second high school (or third) so they can have a bumper crop of kids to have the best of everything. Yeah a football team is going to be great when you have 100s of kids trying out to choose from.  While the average student has impossible odds of doing well in any extra curricular activity because they're competing against 3 high schools worth of students. It's disgusting. I'm sure having 1000 kids in the marching band really helps each kid get the best individual help possible on their instrument.... 

permalinksave[+]GTI-Mk6 4 points5 points6 points 16 hours ago  (1 child)[–]GTI-Mk6 4 points5 points6 points 16 hours agoThis is common practice to. They bassicly gerrymander the lines to get the best/rich athletes. 

permalinksaveparent[+]SandraD04 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours ago  (0 children)[–]SandraD04 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours agoIt's not gerrymandering if they aren't changing city lines, though. They're just adding to the building. They've also seen what happens to surrounding cities that split the schools up. It creates an even bigger class/race/etc. split. If they can afford it, what's the problem?

permalinksaveparent[+]eric22vhs 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours ago  (0 children)[–]eric22vhs 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours agoWas it overcrowded though? Or did classroom size and availability of elective courses seem to be about normal?
I know what you mean about size vs sports champs though. I went to a good size, really overcrowded school that was pretty bad in terms of academic averages, but had champs in nearly every sport or major activity with a few exceptions. Baseball, football, soccer, and track probably had at least 100 - 200 kids trying out. Whereas, that was an entire graduating class size for a lot of other schools in the area.

permalinksaveparent[+]SandraD04 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours ago  (0 children)[–]SandraD04 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours agoAs someone who went to this school and was in the marching band (I think it capped out at around 650-700 by the end of my senior year) and it was a time that I deeply treasure. I found the kids that didn't feel like they were getting personal attention were the same ones that weren't working to achieve anything. 10 years later I see my band director and he remembers me and we talk about that time and have a great time! 
It became more and more crowded after I left, but in ever felt too crowded. The classroom sizes were small and there are more specialized and vocational courses available every year. 
I would be incredibly lucky to send my children to a school like Allen HS.

permalinksave[+]MJMohanborn and bred 29 points30 points31 points 21 hours ago  (0 children)[–]MJMohanborn and bred 29 points30 points31 points 21 hours agoAllen actually spends a ton of money on its education system as well :x
Top notch school district.

permalinksaveparent[+]kauneus 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours ago  (0 children)[–]kauneus 6 points7 points8 points 21 hours agoI'm the first to point out the unnecessary extravaganza that is high school football, but sports have the potential to make districts profit as well. 

permalinksaveparent[+]eric22vhs 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours ago  (0 children)[–]eric22vhs 0 points1 point2 points 15 hours agoSeems it, but if the school district is doing exceptionally well, I don't see why they shouldn't be able to spend their money on sports like this. It would be one thing if half the programs at the school were severely under budget, and grades were terrible.

permalinksaveparent[+]ronintetsuro -2 points-1 points0 points 18 hours ago  (1 child)[–]ronintetsuro -2 points-1 points0 points 18 hours agoI want to go to that school and interview students not on the football team, just to see how good the funding is for... you know, educational opportunities. 

So how's the funding for the Science, Math, Music, Art, and Computer tracks? Oh, your Debate team, theater program, school lunches, and class size have all suffered? You don't say?

permalinksave[+]Nigelwethers -1 points0 points1 point 14 hours ago  (1 child)[–]Nigelwethers -1 points0 points1 point 14 hours agoWhat a waste of money for a game where people run for a short period of time with a ball, then spend several minutes slapping each other's asses because they're stoked they successfully ran with a ball.

permalinksave[+]SaggitariutJeferspin 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours ago  (0 children)[–]SaggitariutJeferspin 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours agoWhen you consider the revenue the game generates for the school district, it's actually a very smart investment.
