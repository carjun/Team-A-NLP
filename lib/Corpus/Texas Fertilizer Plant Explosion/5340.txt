♦ Madonna - Live To Tell ©1986Thank you for watching! Visit my channel for more classic videos!http://www.youtube.com/user/PanMvideos♦ Madonna's official websitehttp://madonna.com♦ LyricsI have a tale to tellSometimes it gets so hard to hide it wellI was not ready for the fallToo blind to see the writing on the wallA man can tell a thousand liesI've learned my lesson wellHope I Live To Tell the secret I have learnedTill then, It will burn inside of meI know where beauty livesI've seen it once, I know the warm she givesThe light that you could never seeIt shines inside, you can't take that from meA man can tell a thousand liesI've learned my lesson wellHope I Live To Tell the secret I have learnedTill then, It will burn inside of meThe truth is never far behindYou kept it hidden wellIf I Live To Tell the secret I knew thenWill I ever have the chance againIf I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very farHow would they hear the beating of my heartWill it grow cold, the secret that I hide, will I grow old(Will it grow cold)How will they hear.....when will they learn.....how will they knowA man can tell a thousand liesI've learned my lesson wellHope I Live To Tell the secret I have learnedTill then, It will burn inside of meThe truth is never far behindYou kept it hidden wellIf I Live To Tell the secret I knew thenWill I ever have the chance again
