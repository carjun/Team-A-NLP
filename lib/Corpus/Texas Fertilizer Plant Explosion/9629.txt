Turns out he survived for a while longer and died of natural causes, and was not executed!! I felt bloody bad for the poor guy. Glad he wasnt purged.

Tips? either stay moving, or hide in a bush with a camo net and abuse the hell out of your very good camo bonus. throw some binocs on there and light up your own targets! everything pens you, nothing makes me shit myself faster than a KV-2 or a luchs with the autoloader gun, avoid taking hits, you have low health and your armour would be stronger if you wrapped it in wet toilet paper.

All over it, and enough weakspots to make me glad to get back into a german tank.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (4)WoT Wishlist  by  CorpseFoolin  WorldofTanks[+]TheFunnyShotgun 3 points4 points5 points 8 days ago  (0 children)[–]TheFunnyShotgun 3 points4 points5 points 8 days agoSkill based MM would mean everyone has winrates that are nearly the same, why punish good players by putting them up against other good players? If a player is good, he deserves the win he carries his team too. Skill based MM would also increase wait times to get into matches, its a bad idea in my opinion.
