Before beginning a new project I often start with a series of improvisations based on ideas I'm interested in working with. I then study these improvisations, learn what works, what doesn't, and then refine them into more finished compositions. This video is a recording of such an improvisation. It is a sort of journey... searching... finding... accepting... rejecting... embracing... then turning away. It's all there: the good, the bad, and the ugly.It was recorded in one take, with the Jupiter-4 arpeggiating a B-flat minor chord prior to starting the camera (although I didn't check to see if the pitch was really B-flat minor! The Jupiter was drifting really badly the day I recorded this).Apologies in advance for the length. It's a bit too long. I considered fading it out after around 6:40... but then decided to just let it run on until the end for any brave souls out there willing to sacrifice ten minutes of life watching it. It's kind of nice to hear the theme come back, a bit more solid than before - except I forgot to disengage the High Pass Filter on the Jupiter, which is a pity... but with improvisation, there's no turning back!Hope you enjoy it!Equipment used: Roland Promars, Roland Jupiter-4, Electro Harmonix Deluxe Memory Man, Avid Digi002R audio interface, MOTU 8pre, Apple Powermac G5 running Pro Tools LE 7.4
