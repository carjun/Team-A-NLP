Let me just tell you guys, that explosion was HUGE. I felt it shake my house as I was on Reddit.

permalinksave[+]TheEccentricSpeaker 305 points306 points307 points 5 months ago  (16 children)[–]TheEccentricSpeaker 305 points306 points307 points 5 months agoYou should probably evacuate the premises and find somewhere else to stay for the next few days. It's definitely not safe in that area right now, especially with the high winds circulating the ammonia. Stay safe.

permalinksaveparent[+]Antartic_Camel 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]Antartic_Camel 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoyeah this front coming thru is not helping with all the chemicals in the air

permalinksaveparent[+]TheEccentricSpeaker 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]TheEccentricSpeaker 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoIt really isn't. Perhaps though, the high winds will circulate the toxic air enough to dissipate their levels so they aren't as dangerous. We can only hope.

permalinksaveparent[+]Antartic_Camel 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]Antartic_Camel 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoyeah if im right the winds are North west tongiht so it shouldnt be to bad. i think Corsicana area would be the area affected if it were to be toxic

permalinksaveparent[+]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoHopefully by now the air isn't as bad. I'm not too common with ammonia nitrate explosions so I'm not exactly sure how the air is affected. I assume that there are fumes/smoke surrounding the area that could be quite potent. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Antartic_Camel 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Antartic_Camel 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoyeah and there is a video of a guy seeing the explosion. then he drives over there right thru a bunch of smoke.

permalinksaveparent[+]oh_rats 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]oh_rats 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoUnless he's south of West. Waco is a safe zone, because we're having super strong N winds. If he's N of West, he needs to GTFO.

permalinksaveparent[+]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI agree, although I read somewhere that the thunderstorms that rolled through today have dissipated most of the fumes from the surrounding area.

permalinksaveparent[+]AnthropomorphicDream 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]AnthropomorphicDream 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI doubt there's much ammonia left after that explosion.

permalinksaveparent[+]lofi76 20 points21 points22 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]lofi76 20 points21 points22 points 5 months agoFrom what I'm hearing on BBC interview, you may be concerned about air quality. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Skopos 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]Skopos 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoResidents as far as west Forth Worth are reporting smelling the smoke from fire. The ammonia won't travel that far, of course, but that's just nuts.

permalinksaveparent[+]inhuman4 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]inhuman4 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoThe concern won't just be from the ammonia though. It is quite likely that the explosion released toxic chemicals on site from whatever containment they were in. 

permalinksaveparent[+]calcitrant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]calcitrant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI live near the closed site of a chemical plant explosion 30 miles from West that contained similar stuff and based on my experience, the air will reak, fauna will die and people will suffer more respiratory infections... for years to come.

permalinksaveparent[+]calcitrant 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]calcitrant 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoIt's useless. This happened on a slightly smaller scale about 2 years ago 30 miles North of him at a Magnablend chemical storage facility, and we can still smell that.

permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–][deleted] 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoDude, get out of there. Stay safe.

permalinksaveparent[+]JohnSmith1776 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]JohnSmith1776 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoYou might want to go stay somewhere else for a couple days if the after effects of it burning is toxic in some way(not familiar with that combustion process). When there was that huge fire in Bastrop, the next day Austin was all breathing ash. Ever been in a room with someone smoking, and there's smoke just hanging in the air and making it cloudy? Outside was like that. So if you don't want to go anywhere, you probably don't want to spend too much time outside breathing in whatever crap that fire makes.

permalinksaveparent[+]calcitrant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]calcitrant 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoFWIW, the concussion from the explosion shook my house about 30 miles North of you, and I can smell it now.

permalinksaveparent[+]yessykeena 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]yessykeena 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoWe live in north arlington and my husband mentioned the windows "coming in". I tried to ask him what he meant and he said "I don't know. The windows just looked like they were coming in". So surreal when we realized what it really.was.
