The song Night Drive, from the Gotye album Like Drawing Bloodhttp://www.gotye.com/http://www.facebook.com/gotye/http://www.twitter.com/gotye/***********************************When you're feeling downI'm comin' roundTo pick you upAnd take you outIt won't be long'Till those blues are goneThe city's waitingBeckoning for usIt leads us onLet it lead us onIt's the perfect nightTo just drive on byLet the dashboard underscoreEverything we've seenWhile the world plays for our pleasureOn our windshield silver screenAnd I don't know just where we're goingAnd I don't care where we've beenBut we just coast on throughCoz while I'm here with you, you knowThere's no place I'd rather beNo place I'd rather beSuch a quiet joyKnowing that I'm your pick-up fixAnd you're my favourite boyYou're feeling tiredAnd I'm bleary-eyedAnd the highway linesPass by in two/four double-timeAnd we don't even recogniseA single name on the street signsNothing else is calling usBut all we've left behindIs like a hell-hound on our trailand a burden on our mindCoz we know......we gotta go home.Such a quiet joyDriving anywhereKnowing that you are there.But you don't call,You don't call me no moreAnd i waited all dayYou know you'll alwaysBe my favourite boy
