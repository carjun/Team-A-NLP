Strip club in the middle of the Galleria shopping area.

permalinksaveparent[+]TreesACrowd 76 points77 points78 points 5 months ago  (10 children)[–]TreesACrowd 76 points77 points78 points 5 months agoHouston is not exemplary because it is an exception to zoning laws altogether. Almost every other city/town has some level of zoning, even if it is lax.

permalinksaveparent[+]ArchZodiac 12 points13 points14 points 5 months ago  (6 children)[–]ArchZodiac 12 points13 points14 points 5 months agoExactly. Houston is the only major city in the US with no zoning laws at all. I believe the last time we rejected it was back in 1993.

permalinksaveparent[+]VoodooWoman 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]VoodooWoman 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoUm, okay, thanks but no thanks to that. Yikes.

permalinksaveparent[+]ArchZodiac 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]ArchZodiac 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIt isn't bad. Some things can make it weird, like where the occasional club will pop up, but all in all it works fine and you have the freedom to start a business wherever you see fit.

permalinksaveparent[+]Obnoxious_liberal 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]Obnoxious_liberal 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoIt has far reaching effects on planning and development. Sprawl leads to more traffic, more pollution, and no planning. Of course, it also helps get prices down. 

permalinksaveparent[+]ArchZodiac 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]ArchZodiac 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoTraffic is one of the worst aspects of Houston. Pollution is also getting bad, but it depends which part of houston really you're living in since its so large.

permalinksaveparent[+]Obnoxious_liberal 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Obnoxious_liberal 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoDue to the lack of planning and no will for a large rail system you can expect traffic to get much, much worse. We aren't expanding roads, we aren't expanding rail, but we are building everywhere. 

permalinksaveparent[+]ArchZodiac 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]ArchZodiac 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIndeed. There is one metro coming through the university though. I'm hopeful it will gain attention and demand for future plans.

permalinksaveparent[+]movzx 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]movzx 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoDoesn't that just make his point even more? Guy says Texas isn't known for strict zoning laws, and he posts an example of the lax laws (in this case, no law).

permalinksaveparent[+]TreesACrowd 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]TreesACrowd 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoNot really. Houston stands alone in Texas; no other city lacks zoning laws. I'm not saying his point is wrong, just that Houston isn't exemplary of the rest of the state.
It's like saying, "Towns in Michigan are known for their high crime rate. Just look at Detroit."

permalinksaveparent[+]jdowpcs 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]jdowpcs 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoAs a resident of Houston, I always worry for people that live near several major plants on the East and Southern side. Residences within earshot of them, it's nuts - you couldn't pay me to live there. Luckily I live about 20 miles north of most of the plants.

permalinksaveparent[+]zaurefirem 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]zaurefirem 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoDon't forget the sketchy as fuck looking adult store. It's like falling apart...and it's right next to the Galleria, too.

permalinksaveparent[+]zimm3rmann 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]zimm3rmann 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoSupposedly it's because the land owner wanted way too much for that one square of parking lot. Galleria wouldn't buy, so he opened a hideous looking adult store. 

permalinksaveparent[+]zaurefirem 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]zaurefirem 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI'm tempted to stop in but it just looks way too sketchy.

permalinksaveparent[+]atafies 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]atafies 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoWell it looks discrete/classy enough from what I've seen passing by, they don't have huge signs advertising ladies.  It even has a fountain.

permalinksaveparent[+]poorleno111 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]poorleno111 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoThere's a couple on that portion of Westheimer. At least they look relatively classy...

permalinksaveparent[+]fixedtehknollpost 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]fixedtehknollpost 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoThats a poor example.   Schools next to warehouse next to commercial next to residential is a better example.   
Yes, Houston zoning is a goddamn free for all but strip club locations as it pertains to commercial zoning isn't highly regulated in plenty of places.   And strip clubs locations are one of the few things regulated in Houston to any extent.

permalinksaveparent[+]SteveZ1ssou 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]SteveZ1ssou 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoNothin' wrong with that. 
However, they are a sorry excuse for a strip club.
