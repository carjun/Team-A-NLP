Yay! So here goes a new amv of mine. Really glad how it turned out, hope you'll like it as well!So to begin with, I'd like to thank everyone, who took part in my -pairing suggestion- poll. The HidaIta one got the biggest number of votes, the yuri pairing was on 3rd or 4th place X). Song: in creditsProgram used: Sony Vegas 9.0 proPairings: HidaIta - SakuHina I had really a lot of fun while editing, even though masking took me dozens of hours, seriously. For example the standing Itachi [1:12-1:16] is about 30-40 masks =.=. Let alone Sakura on 1:33 xD. But it's holidays so I don't count passing time, as far as it gives me some pleasure, yey. And woo, my 1st yuri vid, partly though but still :). And don't be deceived with false impression, I HATE the current ending! Just needed some pic for an outro, it was completely random.I hope the idea is clear but if anyone didn't get it, I come with help there. So firstly Sakura beat Itachi's up. Hidan comes and sees him laying on the ground and wants to avenge his friend [lover? choose by yourself, no particular liking for the pairing from my side;)]. Then he fights Sakura and as is about to hurt her, Hinata comes up. At the end, Itachi finally stands up and the fight starts over again with the all 4 involved in it.And again, thank you Lucy for uploading the video!Btw. be sure to check her account [and her new sasusakukarin video], she's the great editor *_*http://youtube.com/lucyfromtheblockHAPPY SUMMER, have fun guys! I'm leaving for 2 weeks and then for next 2, so I'll be off for approximately 1 month. When I'm back, will get to some drama Pein amv making, just hope all the required eps will be out till then..
