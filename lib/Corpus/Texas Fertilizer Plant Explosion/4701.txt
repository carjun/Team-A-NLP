[Please read this and quit with the questions when most of the answers are here]Lead Singer, Andy (Six) Biersack, From "Black Veil Brides" injures self after a seemingly unintelligent (no offense) jump attempt. Sorry, unable to get audio from mobile device, the booming music literally blew out my audio. And crappy quality is also due to mobile device. He got back up afterwards, resumed singing after injury, blood dripping down his lip, and stated to crowd that he thinks he has a few broken ribs but even though he's in a lot of pain, his  fans make it feel better (while saying motherfuckers here and there like i guess he usually does)  Some people would be sad to see Andy get hurt, but it shouldn't be entirely ignored or disliked due to the fact that he gets back up and pulls through with his performances, which is all in all something worth liking, not disliking. (He still played 3 more songs after this)[Jeffree Star and Matt Good are in fact in this video at around 1:44 and a bit onward. And apparently -and this is according to a friend who stuck around- Andy bought a pretzel with Jeffree before going to hospital which sounded pretty funny to me. Who knows though? My friend is a pretty big liar]
