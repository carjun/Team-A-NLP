(c) 2013 vintage synthesizer demo track by RetroSound"Chimes" autumn tracksall synthesizer sounds: YAMAHA DX7 II FD  FM-Synthesizer (1987)recording: multi-tracking without midifx: reverb and delayThe demo shows typical and not so typical FM sounds. I like this synth a lot! Yamaha should built a DX7 III with realtime controller like the﻿ old PSS FM﻿ keyboards, with internal arpeggiator, step sequencer and a fx unit with reverb and delay and chorus. this would be fantastic.
