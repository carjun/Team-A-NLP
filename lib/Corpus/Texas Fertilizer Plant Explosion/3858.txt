If you listen to it again, neither of them respond to each other.

permalinksaveparent[+]Jabanxhi 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]Jabanxhi 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoBest thing to do would be to open your mouth to equalize pressure on the eardrums... I think.

permalinksaveparent[+]ClimbingC 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]ClimbingC 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoSwallowing, or yawning will do far more good than just looking like a goldfish.

permalinksaveparent[+]Jabanxhi 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Jabanxhi 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoBoth, when explosion is about to happen: try to "look like a goldfish".
But after explosion stop being fishy and swallow or yawn.

permalinksaveparent[+]jyomas 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]jyomas 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoSo. The kid is most likely okay, right?

permalinksaveparent[+]Banditjack 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Banditjack 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoMost ear injuries do heal.  There may be some long term damage but I'd say in a week or 2 his/her eardrums will heal to at least 90% or so.  
(source, had both ears blown out by fireworks and had ruptured eardrums 2 months ago from an infection.)

permalinksaveparent[+]specter800 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]specter800 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoIn a situation like that they were likely thinking the exact same thing, leave. The father was probably not listening for confirmation but rather looking for confirmation by turning around because in a fight or flight situation of this magnitude all you're going to hear (if they could hear at all) is blood pounding in your ears so visual confirmation is all that is reliable. Even visual confirmation would be somewhat difficult because a lot of people have severe tunnel vision in a scenario like this and will also have shaking, particularly on the dominant side of the body. Having said that, they probably couldn't hear, but the visual confirmation would have been primary either way.

permalinksaveparent[+]Banditjack 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Banditjack 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoI think he calls her name. I could be wrong on this. 

permalinksaveparent[+]AATroop 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]AATroop 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoYeah, they're both likely deaf for a few months. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Banditjack 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Banditjack 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agocouple of weeks tops.   Its a gradual thing. I'd say by now they have some hearing back. 

permalinksaveparent[+]EndymionAwake -2 points-1 points0 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]EndymionAwake -2 points-1 points0 points 5 months agoThe only thing at that distance or closer to the explosion that was capable of sensibly understanding sound at that point would have been Siri. 
....which I guess says a lot about how humanity has gotten damn good at this whole 'technology' thing.
