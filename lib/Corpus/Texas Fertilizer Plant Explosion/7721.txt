It makes no difference whether that life is a Jewish life, Christian or Muslim.  by  zorro24in  worldnews[+]verik 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago* (0 children)[–]verik 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago*You should probably read the entire passage the one verse you're referring to is in.  He states he didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill the laws of old.  The laws of old include the prophecy that God will form a new covenant (such as written in Jeremiah)

“The days are coming,” declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. 32It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them" declares the Lord.
33“This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,” declares the Lord. “I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 34No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the Lord. “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”

The verse you're speaking of (Matthew 5:17) is in the middle of the sermon on the mount which is a pinnacle moment in Christ's ministry and message.
5:17 says: "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."
This is immediately following his message of:

3“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Immediately following his statement of fulfilling the laws, he says :

Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

The word commands is referring to the commands he is delivering on the mount.
He also goes on to specifically target topics of the first covenant, murder, adultery, oath breaking, eye for an eye, loving your neighbor/hating your enemy.  And how he teaches a different and new message on all of these topics than the laws of old.
Chapter 6 continues with him speaking about righteous acts:

“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
2 “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

And prayer:

5 “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. 7 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. 8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.

insert Lord's Prayer

14 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.

He continues later with cutting down the old covenant's commands restricting materials of clothing and types of meat that are kosher to eat:

“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?

He continues in Ch 7 with calling those who judge others hypocrites:

“Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
3 “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?

These are literally the words of Christ telling his followers to act in a completely contradicting manner with regards to the first covenant.  For Christians to say they still follow the laws of the Leviticus is contradictory to the words of the man they believe is the son of God.
Hebrews 8 further reinforces that the laws of leviticus.  The first covenant of god and man, have been superseded by the new covenant:

This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”[a] 6 But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.

"theirs" in this verse is referring to the ministry of the priests before him as this chapter and chapter 9 are the parts which reiterate that Christ was the highest of priests and that the sacrifices of redemption of animals that were unclean on the outside (referring to high priests sacrificing goats for forgiveness of sins) was no longer needed as Christ was the ultimate sacrifice.

7 For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another. 8 But God found fault with the people and said[b]:

Reiterates the message of Jeremiah 31:31-33 here in verses 8-12

13 By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.

This is literally stated that God found fault with the people and there was need for a new covenant to replace the first.

9:15 For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.

To wrap this excessively long wall of text up...
tl:dr - Yes, Christ and the New Testament repeatedly reiterate that the old covenant is replaced with the new and that Christ was sent to mediate a new covenant between God and man.

That's exactly the kind of admission they will have in the mortgage case.  Admission of negligence on controls, poor operational oversight, and violation of security law.
Also, the article even states that $4 billion of the suspected $11 billion is to settle consumer cases.

can be explained as a single rogue employee

So you're saying you're clueless as to the situation around the rogue trader?  Feel free to read up.  The trader dubbed the london whale was trading a strategy based on the strategy pushed by his bosses boss, the head of London CIO.  Also, late 2011 saw agreements on winding down the position yet after the chief risk officer was replaced in jan 2012 with someone who had no formal exp as a risk officer (was brother of an executive in the states), the london CIO urged the traders to continue defending the position from accruing it's losses (in turn which expanded the size of it).  When questioned by the America's CIO, he had a reputation for just shouting at her until she stopped questioning it (he was also fired from Bankers trust back in the day for hostility towards employees as well).  
But no... you're right.  This was just a single lone VP trader slipping under the radar.

In the old testament though (you're referring to the Laws of Leviticus).  
However, you (and plenty of Christians) happen to be ignoring the second half of that book that speaks of forgiveness through Christ, no one but God has the right to judge the transgressions of others, turning the other cheek to those that strike you, and that the meek shall inherit the earth (are favored in God's eyes).
Christianity is based around the prophecy of the line of David.  That Christ came to mediate a New Covenant between God and his followers "not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt" (Jeremiah 31:32, though also spoken about in Hebrews 8:7-13).
Not preaching religion here... just stating that there is a common misconception about Christianity promoting hatred and judgement (that even many Christians seem to succumb to).

There really is no standard definition of a gold bar.

The world markets say else wise.  The LMBA issues specifications for good delivery bars that are what futures contracts are settled with.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Delivery
Here are specs for a London Good Delivery gold bar:

Fineness: minimum of 995.0 parts per thousand fine gold
Marks: serial number, refiner's hallmark, fineness, year of manufacture
Gold content: 350–430 troy ounces (11–13 kg)
Recommended dimensions
Length (top): 210–290 mm
Width (top): 55–85 mm
Height: 25–45 mm

Leaving money to an endowment fund (e.g. Rockefeller, Carnegie, Franklin, Mellon, etc) leaves the wealth under the control of a entity that's lifespan is indefinite (well, for the most part.  I think certain states limit lifespans of trusts... e.g. Florida's limit is 360 years).  You establish the purpose and constraints of the entity's operations at it's formation and therefore you can aim to direct the purpose of your wealth even once you pass on.
The law against perpetuities is to engage in a contract that dictates how the money is used once it changes hands.  The simplest explanation is you can't attempt to issue a legal constraint that your relative "A" will inherit your house and decides that once he dies, relative "B" will inherit it from him.  The law prohibits relative "A" from having a contractual obligation dictated from a person who is no longer living.  Once the wealth or title or object changes hands of ownership via inheritance, so does the sovereign control of the asset.
