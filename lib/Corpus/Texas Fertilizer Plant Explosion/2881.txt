Tell me they don't have it easy. I dare you.  by  fraggles63in  CFB[+]e8odie 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours ago  (0 children)[–]e8odie 0 points1 point2 points 23 hours agoanother way to look at it, since we're talking about strength of schedule, is combined opponent record. not counting FCS teams, it's as follows:

Alabama: 13-6 (68%) (not to mention they're about to play an 0-4 Georgia St. followed by what's most likely going to be a 1-4 Kentucky)
Oregon: 8-9 (47%)
Clemson: 9-7 (56%)
Ohio St.: 8-13 (38%)
Stanford: 9-9 (50%)

all not very impressive when teams like Georgia are at 76.5% (the highest in the top 25), Florida St. at 65%, Texas A&M at 62%, Washington at 69%, (meanwhile, for shits and giggles, Michigan is at 26%, the lowest in the top 25)
