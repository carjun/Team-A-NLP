"Nothing happened to me, Officer Starling. I happened. You can't reduce me to a set of influences. You've given up good and evil for behaviorism, Officer Starling. You've got everybody in moral dignity pants - nothing is ever anybody's fault. Look at me, Officer Starling. Can you stand to say I'm evil? Am I evil, Officer Starling?"

Dr. Lecter himself considers psychology to be "puerile". He sees psychology as "simplistic", but he understands it. Rather, he understands people and knows how to manipulate them, and how to actually help them as well.
He would not see himself as having any sort of mental disorder, not just because he acknowledges who and what he is without any sort of remorse or apologies, but because he sees such attempts at classification as overly simplistic.

The man and I don't talk often, but during one of our more recent conversations he accused the president of "Not believing in American exceptionalism" and when I responded that I didn't believe in such a thing either, and that this sort of blind patriotism and flag-waving made me uncomfortable, he said he found my reaction "sad". He seemed genuinely disappointed that I didn't believe in the same Normal-Rockwell America that he does.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (40)Exploring Valve’s masterplan: on SteamOS, Steam Machines and the future of the PC - PCGamer  by  CaptainRyan47in  Steam[+]ThiZ 10 points11 points12 points 2 days ago* (0 children)[–]ThiZ 10 points11 points12 points 2 days ago*The thing that interests me most out of all of this is the bit about biometrics. Everything about it is absolutely fascinating. 
I mean, consider the AI Director: It takes in all this information about the players and what they're doing. Now we give it information about their pulse rate or sweat pH, too. Now it can do things like target the guy who's least stressed out, and not just rely on what it can see happening in-game.
Which is something Valve actually did, and the results of which are something I would LOVE to see, same for any follow-ups they've done, or will do.
