I guess I could do that though. I already had a red one. And I just completed all the player cards. was going to make them seperate ones, but now I realize it was kind of stupid to do that.

I think that is probably similar to DOTA.

Just to clarify things, Dota 2 has everything available from the start (after you complete the tutorial). All heroes and skills are at your disposal. Similar to LoL, all items are completely cosmetic.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (100)SIP LoL or DOTA 2?  by  Spectrophillyacin  ShouldIbuythisgame[+]EmptyMags2 1 point2 points3 points 3 months ago  (0 children)[–]EmptyMags2 1 point2 points3 points 3 months agoI prefer Dota 2. The Tutorial is very well done, taking a bit of the steep learning curve down a notch. While it may be rough if your start was anything like mine, in time, once you understand wtf is going on, it's really fun. One thing I think is important thing is that you find somebody you know to play with. Makes everything a helluva lot more fun.
Try em both, but my vote is Dota 2, and if that is the route you go, give me a shout and I can help or we can play a game or two.
