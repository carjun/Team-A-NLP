Subreddit Rules
Please do not:

Editorialize the titles of your link submissions or they may be removed. Your headline should match the article's headline as closely as possible, to avoid misrepresenting the gist or facts of the article.
Post opinion pieces that contain little to no factual data.
Resort to racist/sexist insults, in submissions or comments. They add nothing to the discussion, and they will be removed. If you use repeated hate speech or abusive language you may get a temporary ban from the community. Repeated violators will be permanently banned.
Use link shorteners. Reddit usually assumes that they’re spam, so they end up in the spam filter. If you have a comment or submission that you want to be seen immediately, don’t use link shorteners.
Post users' personal information. It will be removed and you will be banned from the subreddit without warning.
Post more than FIVE posts per day.
Create a post for the purpose of deriding, exposing or otherwise ridiculing specific members of reddit.

Please do:

Message the moderators when you report something. Many times we have no idea why a link/comment has been reported, and it just takes up time that we could be using to actually read the subreddit. Reports should be reserved for submissions/comments that don’t meet the guidelines - spammers, hate speech, completely off-topic.
Continue to comment freely while still adhering to the rules above.
