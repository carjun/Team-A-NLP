The dude was an average #1 receiver the entire time he was here. 
Chalk that up to cam camerons offense or whatever you want, it doesnt alter the fact that Anquan was never as good as everyone seems to all of a sudden make him out to be when he was here.

Flacco had extremely tight windows to throw into and the receivers were never really able to make much separation with the route tree provided

Military has 30 round clips, you pick your shots and just shoot for the head. Youre almost literally aiming at sitting ducks. Just waddling towards you. 
If one of your people goes down, they are going to be torn to shreds and almost devoured. They will also be a distraction for you to kill more zombies. 
A zombie apocalypse would not last very long with walking dead type zombies.

3 years into ed reeds career, he already had 21 INTs and a DPOY under his belt. And all of that as a SS, he switched to FS like 1 or 2 years later and should have won DPOY in 2008 AND 2010.
The dude should be a 3 time DPOY. 
Earl is very good but no, no comparison

This isn't even an argument. Troy aikman is in no way better of a qb than Brett Favre.

permalinksavecontextfull commentsWho do you think the better quarterback is, Troy Aikmen or Brett Favre?  by  Dabearsssin  nfl[+]cant_be_pun_seen 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours ago  (0 children)[–]cant_be_pun_seen 1 point2 points3 points 23 hours agoHaha WHAT? Are you insane? Not including his ridiculous final year in MN and he didn't play his first year with ATL, so in 17 years he threw for 497 tds. Peyton manning has 436 in 14(taking his injury year out). Peyton needs 62 more tds to pass him in 3 years to do it faster. Will he do it? Probably, but Peyton is better than favre, albeit not by much.
Troy aikman I don't think ever threw for more than 23tds in one season. I'm sorry, I get it he had emmit. That's still no excuse.
