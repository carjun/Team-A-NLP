Lyrics:Only angels have wings girlAnd poets have all the wordsThe earth belongs to the two of usAnd the sky belongs to the birdsYou've given me so much happinessThat I'll wrap up and give you this songYou gotta grab it with both handsYou gotta keep hanging on...The cat walks to the windowAnd I hear the key turn in the doorNo one knows and anything goesAnd everything falls on the floorThe apartment starts shakingAnd the roof opens up to the sunThe crows flying in parallel linesAnd golly isn't this great fun?Laying in each other's armsWe're sleepy, we begin to nodAnd we start to dream of grandiose thingsOh, God, oh, God, oh, GodYou gotta keep hanging on
