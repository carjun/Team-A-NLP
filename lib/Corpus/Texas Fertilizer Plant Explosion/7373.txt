Uploaded on Jun 28, 2008



People have been writing me asking to hear more material, so I decided to upload this demo version of Colored Glasses, a song I plan to release on CD in the fall of 2008. The synth tracks were recorded on a Roland Jupiter-4, and the bass track was deliciously played by my friend and former classmate Ken Rich (thanks, Ken!). Many apologies for the boring video. Unfortunately, I'm so busy writing songs for Maison Vague's debut CD that I have very little time for making videos. Sorry. ClarkNote: The song can be heard in higher quality audio at http://www.myspace.com/maisonvague--------------------------------------Colored GlassesWearing your rose colored glassesYou can see more clearly nowSee the clouds that hang so heavy on your headTurn a lovely shade of redDisappearingI've got colored glasses, tooYou and I are just beginningThe journey we set out to takeWhen we hit some troubled spots along the wayPut your glasses on and sayPlease don't worryI've got colored glasses, tooWho's to say if we look foolish?Who's to blame if we go mad?In the end it makes no difference to meIf the others cannot seeLife is easyThey need colored glasses, tooWords and Music by Clark Stiefel©2008 All rights reserved
