I still remember your mother, who was wearing a turquoise bathing suit, a white button down shirt, & flip-flops, who kept saying, "Molly, take a dip! Molly, take a dip!" It was cute. Mrs Frawley loved to name things. [She named my dog, etc.] She was bouncing around "The Goo Goo Dolls," after someone's creepy looking doll. [Kris Frawley's?] The rest is history. Congratulations on your tremendous success. [The name worked.]  [All of my personal property as well as my children was / were stolen & now are in South Buffalo. I need it / them back ASAP.. Unfortunately, it is not safe for me to go there. Any assistance would warrant our eternal gratitude. This is a criminal matter.]  Again, you showed them! You guys deserve it!   mmRead moreShow lessAdd a comment...MoreLoading...PeopleIn their circles345 peopleValentino KaurićGarrett SheaZoë-Anne BaldwinHave them in circles3,401 peopleLinksWebsitehttp://www.googoodolls.com/YouTubeGoo Goo DollsLinksOur SiteInner MachineFacebookTwitterStoryTaglineWe are the Goo Goo Dolls.IntroductionMany people remember the 80’s as the decade when pop culture seemed to 
be ruled by Madonna’s latest fashion statement, Duran Duran’s early boy 
band appeal, and the apparently endless list of hair metal bands that, 
even at the time, seemed impossible to tell apart.  However, 
there was something else going on in the 80’s that was a quiet 
continuation of the alternative scene that broke in England in
 1977 with the Sex Pistols and the Clash. There were plenty of kids who 
felt the same frustration and outright boredom that Johnny Rotten and 
Joe Strummer spoke about so well. America had it’s own underground scene
 going, most noticeably in Southern California and New York City. 
However, there were also bands in the rest of America that spoke even 
more effectively to kids trying to ignore what the mass of pop culture 
was throwing at them. Many of these bands, fueled on cheap beer and a 
general disdain for “The American Dream”, looked to Paul Westerberg and 
The Replacements for their inspiration.  The Goo Goo Dolls were 
such a band. Formed in 1986 in the crumbling rust belt city of Buffalo, 
New York, the band was probably started for no better reason than to 
kill time, make some music, and hopefully get a few free beers from the 
clubs where they were lucky enough to get a gig.   And then, as 
lead singer / guitarist John Rzeznik says, “Somewhere in there we sort 
of figured out how to write songs.” The band’s third album, Hold Me Up, 
released in 1990, showcased the sound of the band that would later be 
refined on their next two releases, Superstar Carwash and A Boy Named 
Goo. It was the latter of these two releases that landed the band their 
first hit song with “Name” in 1995. A Boy Named Goo went on to sell over
 two million copies, and the band toured extensively around the world to
 support their newfound success.  But it was in 1998 that the 
Goo Goo Dolls proved that they were not destined to be a “one hit 
wonder.” In that year Rzeznik penned “Iris,” which originally appeared 
on the City Of Angels soundtrack, and was also included on the band’s 
sixth album Dizzy Up The Girl. “Iris” spent almost a year on the 
Billboard charts, including a phenomenal 18 weeks at #1.   And 
that, as it turned out, was just the beginning. Dizzy Up The Girl also 
contained the hits “Slide”, “Black Balloon” and “Broadway,” all of which
 were top ten hits on the Billboard charts. The band spent the next two 
years touring relentlessly all around the world, building a loyal 
following that most bands can only dream of. It became clear that the 
Goo Goo Dolls were not going away anytime soon.  The band has 
continued to build momentum. 2002 saw the release of Gutterflower, which
 included such hits as  “Here Is Gone” and “Sympathy.” In 2004 a live 
DVD was released featuring an incredible July 4th show performed in the 
band’s hometown. Let Love In was released in 2006, and featured “Better 
Days” and a chart-topping cover of Supertramp’s “Give A Little Bit.” And
 the whole time the band has been racking up an impressive list of 
achievements to say the least: 4 Grammy nominations, 13 consecutive top 
10 multi-format hit songs, and over 10 million albums sold. Rzeznik has 
also been the recipient of the Hal David Starlight Songwriter Award. 
 2010 marks the 24th year since founding members John Rzeznik and Robby 
Takac first starting playing music together. Joined for the past 15 
years by drummer Mike Malinin, the Goo Goo Dolls will be touring in 
support of their ninth studio album, Something For The Rest Of Us. 
Written and recorded over the past couple of years, the album delivers 
another dose of great Goo songs such as “Sweetest Lie,” “One Night”, and
 “Soldier.” With his songwriting, Rzeznik confronts some of the issues 
that have become part of many people’s everyday lives. “I wanted some of
 the material on this album to address the disillusionment of the 
difficult period we live in; I wanted to give a voice to the emotional 
uncertainty that accompanies hard times. So many people are struggling 
to keep it together through tough economic conditions and two wars that 
seem to have no end in sight. The ones who bear the brunt of these 
burdens are everyday people. That’s who I want to speak to.”  
The recording of the album took place in various studios in Los Angeles 
as well as the band’s studio in Buffalo, and during the course of events
 the band worked with a wide range of engineers and producers including 
Tim Palmer, John Fields, and Butch Vig. The result showcases more of the
 well-crafted songs and timeless lyrics that have been such an integral 
part of the Goo Goo Dolls’ continuing success.  Most bands that 
were around in 1986 have come and gone. A lot of trends came and went. 
But through it all the Goo Goo Dolls have been able to survive and stay 
relevant. They have grown beyond their influences, and have spent their 
lives creating and performing great songs. And at the end of the day, 
that’s what it’s all about -- songs. So as the trends come and go, or 
when the world gets caught up in the latest celebrity gossip, there will
 always be people hungry for songs that speak to them. And those are the
 people the Goo Goo Dolls are talking to. The Rest of Us.
