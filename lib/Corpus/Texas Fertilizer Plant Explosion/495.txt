We figured it was thunder, then we turned on the news. 50 miles and we felt the aftershock...

permalinksaveparent[+]flockofmoose 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago* (0 children)[–]flockofmoose 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago*I've seen the video, and... just wow. Honestly, how were the dad and kid not killed? I'm genuinely curious considering the massive damage the blast seemed to have caused, anyone familiar with this care to explain?

permalinksaveparent[+]ButtercreamFrosting 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]ButtercreamFrosting 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoYep. Me too.  I was out running, and we heard a huge thunderclap. We found out about 20 minutes later that it wasn't thunder. :/

permalinksaveparent[+]slugagainstsalt 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]slugagainstsalt 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoOh shit! Now that you say that, I think I heard it in Fort Worth. I even pulled up the weather to see if there were storms neat and was confused why I heard thunder with no storm. That was the explosion. 

permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–][deleted] 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI'm in north austin. I did the exact same thing. Had no idea sound could travel that far. 

permalinksaveparent[+]kingcavemanxxi 2 points3 points4 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]kingcavemanxxi 2 points3 points4 points 5 months agoSame here. I'm about 45 minutes away from there and felt my house shake. I also thought it was just thunder, because it looked like a storm was rolling in at the time.

permalinksaveparent[+]frau-fremdschamen 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]frau-fremdschamen 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoSame here! It shook every window in the house and made a huge noise. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Sablehart 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]Sablehart 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI live in Grand Prairie, which is north of Arlington.  I'm a couple stories up, and my roommates and I all felt this because we were sitting quietly waiting for a videogame to load.  We exchanged glances because lately DFW has had a rise in tremors (fracking?) and our apartment seems to be a pretty good conductor of the shaking.  We're really, really far away.

permalinksaveparent[+]sprashoo 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]sprashoo 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoShockwave, not aftershock, btw. Sorry to be pedantic :P

permalinksaveparent[+]Fmeson 5 points6 points7 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]Fmeson 5 points6 points7 points 5 months agoAftershock?

permalinksaveparent[+]RambleMan 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]RambleMan 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoI'm guessing "ohmygod!" delay vs. ground shaking like an earthquake. Explosions don't have aftershocks as far as I know.

permalinksaveparent[+]quagga81 4 points5 points6 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]quagga81 4 points5 points6 points 5 months agoMy guess is "shockwave" was meant.

permalinksaveparent[+]themastermoo 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]themastermoo 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoYeah, I used the wrong word. My bad.
