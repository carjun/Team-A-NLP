THE BODY OF a young woman has been found in the River Shannon, in the search for missing 15-year-old Chloe Kinsella.
The body was recovered by a member of a boat crew from Limerick Marine Search and Rescue, who have been involved in the search since the teen went missing. The discovery was made at Brown’s Quay in the Thomondgate area at about noon, and gardaí said the body has been removed to Limerick University Hospital.
The body has been identified as that of Chloe Kinsella and the local coroner has been notified.
The searches for the teen, who went missing from her home on Saturday, have now been stood down.

It took us 8weeks to find my brother aged 24, he was then recovered 9miles out at sea, this is just heartbreaking, she had her whole life ahead of her,now her poor family are left behind to suffer,you never dream it will happen to you or your family,but it seems to be happening more and more with all age groups,very very sad,its been 8months since we lay our brother to rest and its still torture,he went missing xmas day so this xmas is going to be very lonely and sad without him, RIP Chloe,and god bless and watch over your poor family.

Joseph. You seem more interested in the red thumbs and the mindset that follows them, rather  than the actual story. Get over the red thumbs thing, people are allowed to express opinions, I couldn’t care less if all the thumbs were red it doesn’t many anything really.

Nothing wrong with the reporting, the report said the body had yet to be identified. A Garda spokesperson had said, they think it MAY be Chloe Kinsella, but they have not officially identified the body.

RIP is also associated / derived from the Catholic religion, so some people might have issue with that.  but like I say who cars about the red thumbs.  I’ll even give this post a red thumb to start you all off.

“People are allowed to express opinions”
So you are saying that if people want to be of the opinion that this poor girl is dead then it’s ok to post condolences ?

Personally, I sadly can confirm this report. I’m in Limerick and was told by a friend who was there when she was found and who knows the family. Yes people shouldn’t  jump to conclusions, just not right or fair for the family especially… but sadly in this case she really is gone. Please pray for the grieving family, such a devastating loss.

Reporter on Newstalk just said that her sister walked away, inconsolable after identifying the body. Seems very likely it is her. 
Tragic.

Formal identification would take place at the hospital but her sister confirmed it was Chloe at the scene. So why is everyone giving out about this. We all wish things were different but they are not.  Thoughts and Prayers with the family at this sad time

Suzanne I used post your brother Paul photo daily. At least your family have closure. I know it’s only a small consolation but there are many families who have loved ones missing who never have closure and live in limbo

That it so Bad Lieutenant, but these boards and the comments here will stay online for a long time. Invariably people get in to arguments – even on topics as sensitive as this. Leaving the comments section open for topics like this, when she was only found an hour or 2 ago – is not in the public interest. It’s in the journal interest. Big difference.

In that case, that’s terrible and I’m very sorry to hear it. This was absolutely not a troll, I was commenting on how irresponsible it would have been for that guard to ID her informally potentially before family members had been contacted. That’s all. If I was a troll I’d be using a fake identiyy like others here.

I hope bullying hasn’t been a factor in this tragic death. Too many young girls of this age have died recently as a result of this.

Why would a garda source say it was believed to be her? Bit harsh on friends and family if it turns out not to be the case…

Exactly, I’m saying it’s a bit heartless to postulate until a positive ID is made either way.

It’s been reported on the local news that the body has been identified at the scene by Chloe’s sister and unfortunately, it has been positively identified as Chloe.
Also, she will remain at the scene for now.
Just too sad for words.

They done the same with my brother, they said it was believed to be him but they have a good description of what they look like,there age group,body build,clothes etc so there never really wrong, I wished it wasn’t him at the time but when the body was found they were 99percent sure.

That’s awful Suzanne. My comment was not meant to offend, it was actually sympathetic to the family and friends of the missing girl… it would be awful to be told a loved one’s body had been found only to later have that ID revoked.

Why are people writing rip Chloe it has not been confirmed its actually her yet,, yes the body was found close to where she lives but until it’s 100% confirmed I think people should leave their rip Chloe comments to themselves

Just going by local radio Anne that have confirmed it, rightly or wrongly. Family members were at the scene.
