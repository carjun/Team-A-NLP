THE UNFINISHED ANGLO Irish Bank building in Dublin’s docklands is on the to-paint list of John Morris, the first artist in residence at the Gibson Hotel.
“There is lots to choose from in the area,” said artist John Morris. “But I want to paint the Anglo building before they finish it.”
The Central Bank has already bought the site – once earmarked to be the brand new  headquarters of the now defunct institution – from NAMA in 2012 for €7 million.
Aside from the piece of Irish banking history, Morris will also capture the changing landscape of Dublin’s docklands and waterfront, as well as people from the local community.
He will live in the hotel for the next 10 weeks as he was chosen to kickstart the first artist-in-residence programme. The Dublin native has installed himself at the Point Village hotel but the painting will not begin until next week.
“At the moment I’m just setting up, building the studio, bringing in easels. Once the painting starts, I will do full work days, painting nine through five o’clock,” he told TheJournal.ie.
Usually a painter of seascapes, he intends to capture the entire area around the Point.
By the end of his 10-week stay, he believes he will have completed about 20 to 25 paintings which will be exhibited in the hotel at Christmas.
The idea of a hotel having an artist in residence is not a new one.
“There is a very famous programme in the Savoy in London,” notes Morris. “But I am the guinea pig here.”
As part of the project, local students from Larkin Community College in the north inner city will visit Morris so he can share his knowledge and expertise.
A formal launch is to take place on Tuesday with Arts Minister Jimmy Deenihan in attendance. The hotel plans to host a live webcam of Morris painting a mural of his view from his hotel suite. Guests and visitors will also have opportunities to see the artist working on his canvases during their stay.
A sample of Morris’s recent work:

Silly me. I thought he was going to paint the actual building itself. Some Galway artists have painted on buildings around the docks and museum. They add enormously to the local area.

Come on John,  I wanna see bolts of lightning,  flames coming from pits of despair, sean fitzpatrick’s 3 series bimmer doin doughnut s on the roof and the quinns doin a jig within that doughnut! Top it off with tears of the tax payer white washing the walls to get it ready for future tenants. Or a nice grey building with pastel shades will do.

How about finish the damn building and then paint it! Why is it taking so long to even start making it look better, it’s one of the most noticeable legacy of the boom and bust we have! Perhaps it’s taking so long because a state body bought it?? Apparently the cladding for the outside of it is in a warehouse in Germany, lets get it here and finish the eyesore!

Bertie Ahern and the rest of his comrades should be imprisoned in the unfinished building. Just build a large electric fence around it and leave them there.

Ah I like the tokenism of involving kids from the inner city in  a small way. Such a nice touch/PR ploy from the Central Bank/ Gibson hotel resident artist

To counter the upsurge in the fortunes of Jaguar Cars, Enda has suggested that the Anglo building be used to build a right hand version of the Trabi.

A symbol of the corruption, deceit and hypocrisy eating at the soul of the Irish people, Demolish it I say!. Don’t paint it! So many uncomfortable issues in Ireland have been painted over in bright colours to hide their true nature. 
I hope that one day I can stand and watch this building being demolished and a symbol of  freedom being built in its place. A huge social centre with a park and playground for the people of sheriff st that live just around the corner….. (for example)
One day I hope that a beautiful Irish boy and girl can walk down past this site unfettered by bank bail outs, loans, huge mortgage repayments, suicidal thoughts due to the soul destroying nature of our Americanised post Celtic tiger culture , free of drugs sold by unscrupulous dealers, free of alcohol sold by greed filled publicans, That they can walk free in a land where justice, human rights and freedom actually exist in real terms rather than just the buzz words of the corrupt. That they words they speak to each other are spoken in our beautiful native tongue Gaeilge. Then I shall scream! 
THANK GOD ALMIGHTY!
FREE AT LAST!
FREE AT LAST!
GOD SAVE IRELAND! : )
