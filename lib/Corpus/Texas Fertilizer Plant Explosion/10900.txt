If they lie and say they are behind the guy 100% they get vilified for being dishonest.  If they say it was a difficult choice they get vilified for not inspiring confidence in their QB.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (27)Wisconsin is offering students $5 concessions gift card to students who arrive at least half hour before Northwestern game  by  rowboat21in  CFB[+]Hyperdrunk 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Hyperdrunk 0 points1 point2 points 9 hours agoAs someone who used to sneak in roughly 12 shots of liquor into every single game I went to I agree.  The games are much more fun when you aren't sober.
That said, drunker crowds are less safe crowds.  More likely get into fights, throw things at opposing fans, etc.  Unfortunately not everyone becomes a loving drunk like me.  The angry drunk exists.

I've never read a single comic, but I'm told he gets to be badass "as he gets older".  I just don't think the show is going to be on for another 5 years. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (565)4 MORE DAYS!  by  ogSPLICEin  thewalkingdead[+]Hyperdrunk 12 points13 points14 points 14 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Hyperdrunk 12 points13 points14 points 14 hours agoBreaking Bad, Newsroom, Game of Thrones, Sherlock, House of Cards, Homeland, The Following, etc along with the ability to watch past great shows like West Wing, LOST, and Battlestar Gallactica on Netflix makes us so spoiled as viewers.  No longer does the crap show on network TV need to be what we watch.  
We are spoiled, so we have such high standards nowadays that we are critical of shows like Walking Dead when 15 years ago it'd have been considered a top 2 or 3 show on TV.

I'm actually pretty decent at Battlefield.  Solid K/D, always help my team, etc.  Yet I fail miserably whenever I try and fly a plane.  I don't get how people are so good at them, and every time I try and practice I get shot down in a hurry/yelled at by my teammates so I stick to what I'm good at: Destroying vehicles on foot and finding a way to get my team to the objective.
Who needs to fly planes anyway?  sourgrapes

Yet, I can't help but feel that having a full time personal trainer right there living with you, pushing you to do your twice daily workout would be that motivation.

Really?

If I have a full time personal trainer in my guest house I can't come up with a good excuse to just relax and have a beer at the end of the day with Magnus standing their waiting for me to come pump some iron with him.

Shows they are more than just a pretty face, but an actual well rounded person.
Nothing is worse than a vapid person with nothing going on for them but their looks.

I'd have the body of a Greek God too if I had a full time personal trainer and nutritionist living in my guest house.

If it came around 100 years earlier and spread to all parts of the world before we had the medical expertise to understand it, the infection rate would be massive.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (923)“Alarming” mass die-off of starfish in areas along Canada’s Pacific coast — “They’ve disintegrated, now there’s just goo left” — “Appeared to melt” — “Single arms clinging to rock faces, tube feet still moving”  by  foes_monoin  worldnews[+]Hyperdrunk 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Hyperdrunk 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours agoAmerica, and really the whole world, could handle a lot more people if we were willing to pack ourselves into mega cities and dedicate more land to farming.  
You could fit the entire world's population inside an area the size of the state of Texas if everyone was willing to live in a city as congested as New York City.  The entire world in 1 Texas-sized city with the rest of the world dedicated to farming/etc.  It could be done.
So you could fit all of America's population into 1 sprawling city the size of Ohio with absolute ease (and more space than you'd have in NYC), and then use the rest of the the states to farm food and the like.
The "one big city" idea will never happen and is stupid, but it serves as an example of whats' possible.  If we all move into compact cities we have plenty of space for more people.  We'd just have to convert the farmland that is now suburbs back into farm land.

Now we're getting hitched at 27-32 and having 1 or 2 kids instead.
