permalinksavecontextfull comments (1195)What is the key to being a good liar?  by  cstar84in  AskReddit[+]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours ago  (0 children)[–]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 11 hours agoThat's not it. You also don't have to believe it, although extremely well kept lies should be believed. You just need confidence in your lie. Say it like you're talking about something that happened in a movie.

I haven't ridden it much yet, but I love it so far. I'm sure this is something a lot of people do, but since I got it, I frequently go out into the garage and sit on it for a bit.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (44)Look at the center NOW!!!  by  tea_tea_teain  HalfLife[+]galient5 3 points4 points5 points 11 hours ago  (0 children)[–]galient5 3 points4 points5 points 11 hours agoI could definitely be wrong, but the way I interpreted the parts about the controller was that it was going to be part of the steambox beta. It would seem extremely anti climactic if it was simply a controller. If it is, it better be something revolutionary.

The rest is just a bubbly, see through version of iOS 6. I'd still take android over this any day.

Android used to be ugly, but it has matured into one sexy operating system. iOS looks too bubbly.

Making a phone have better reception isn't copying, but if you copy the techniques used to give it better reception, it is. I mean, the notification shade was in android way before it was in iOS, and that's definitely something the operating system copied. It's a brilliant idea, and it's probably a good thing, but we can still make fun of apple for taking it when they generally get really pissy when other people copy them.

Truly amazing.  by  anothercatforyouin  videos[+]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago* (0 children)[–]galient5 0 points1 point2 points 14 hours ago*This actually happened, but THIS is GoPro marketing. I'm going to link people to this video whenever they say something about a homemade video (made with a GoPro) being the marketing team.

It's bubbly, it's terribly designed and it's bloated. Same thing goes for whatever LG decided to put on the g2. I'd rather get a moto x.

I realize that its a powerful bike, and I'm being careful on it beside I'm new to riding.

He throws lightning bolts, for zeus' sake.

Very excited for this, and I'll be sure to keep it slow for the foreseeable future. I know this thing can go fast, and just riding it around the residential roads near me, I realize that it feels slower than it's actually going. 40 seems like 25, so I'll be sure to keep an eye on the speedometer.

It wouldn't surprise me if that's what the input was all about.

Only thing I could find was a tear in the leather seating, but I already have that fixed.

My entire family owns Hondas (although they're more from the 80's). I was originally going to go with a Ninja 500r, but then I found this one and had to get it.

The point is that I wanted something that I wouldn't get bored of. I feel like this is more than enough power, but not something that is just way too powerful for me to learn on. Some might argue that it's too much, but I think I can handle it.

I also come from a family of riders, so I do have access to a few less powerfil bikes.
