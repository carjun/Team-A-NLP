WEST, Texas -- A massive explosion at a fertilizer plant near Waco on Wednesday night injured dozens of people and sent flames shooting into the night sky, leaving the factory a smoldering ruin following a blast that damaged buildings for blocks in every direction.The explosion at West Fertilizer in West, a community about 20 miles north of Waco, happened shortly before 8 p.m. and could be heard as far away as Waxahachie, 45 miles to the north.Tommy Muska, West's mayor, said at a news conference three hours after the explosion that he didn't yet know how many people had been injured or killed. He said buildings in a five-block radius from the plant were severely damaged by the explosion.

obama speech after half an hour :"make﻿ no mistake we will get to the bottom of this"
a financial collapse : "make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this"
another shy kid kills 30 other kids in his school : "make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this"
a tsunami invade the state of California : "make no mistake we will get to the bottom of this"
maybe you Americans should leave the world alone and take care of your own people ?

Please don`t be so quick to blame what this corrupt brainwashing government does on normal Americans .We can`t stand what this government is doing around the world much less here at home .Place the blame where it belongs on﻿ the government not the people of the nation.
