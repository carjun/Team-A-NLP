If there's one thing Florida is known for beside its sunshine and beaches, it's alligators. At Gatorland, stand feet away from a few giant specimens as you toss them a snack. Have your picture taken with them to show your friends. Or pay for the "Trainer for a Day" experience and get a behind-the-scenes look at all the park's animals, including a wrestling showdown of your very own. #LoveFL
