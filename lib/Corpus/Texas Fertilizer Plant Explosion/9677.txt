I really need a table saw :(

Do you live near any hackerspaces? We get people coming into ours a lot to work on wood projects that they do not have the tools/space to do at home. Great place to get tools you might not normally have. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1122)Power button no longer works? A door bell, some solder, and wayyyyy too much hot glue will fix that!  by  strangerrealityin  techsupportmacgyver[+]thedeepfriedboot 0 points1 point2 points 7 days ago  (0 children)[–]thedeepfriedboot 0 points1 point2 points 7 days agoOnly problem I see is that if the button does not have a guard, you have to be careful not to press it accidentally such as if using the computer as a foot rest.

I have a problem with my network...  by  boywithumbrellain  techsupportgore[+]thedeepfriedboot 4 points5 points6 points 8 days ago  (0 children)[–]thedeepfriedboot 4 points5 points6 points 8 days agoPoE is capable of a theoretical max of ~35W. That is plenty of power to overheat a poor connection.

On an old Poweredge 800, I drilled out the 5.25 and installed a square e-stop button with the little plastic side guards as the power button which came off some old PDU. Works beautifully. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (45)Have you ever plugged your refrigerator into your car?  by  dj_850tin  Justrolledintotheshop[+]thedeepfriedboot 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago  (0 children)[–]thedeepfriedboot 0 points1 point2 points 14 days agoThis is redneck. Those twist-lock connectors are used for AC 120 or 240V, not 12VDC. That unit looks like a 30A rated plug. Anyway, that person should be using something like an Anderson SB175. They probably had some random line cord kicking around and use that to connect an external inverter.

Its basically a power washer for your mouth to clean out between teeth as if flossing.

We will be your neighbors over at Xerocraft in the next unit over. Are we allowed to bring robots to the party?
Also, you may want to let people know which space you are in, or at least put up some direction signs. There are 3 units in the building. You will probably be in the north space whereas we are in the central space. Anyway, welcome to the building!

His had issues with dropping the wifi connection and rolling around uncontrolled. Both our robots are based on old mobility scooters and weigh 50-100Lbs so they can do some damage if they crash into things.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (33)Good guy amateur stick driver  by  charbokin  funny[+]thedeepfriedboot 1 point2 points3 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]thedeepfriedboot 1 point2 points3 points 1 month agoI was commenting on Alaaira314's comment which addresses rolling with automatic transmissions. Yes, Manual is tougher, that's why I prefer to tow trailers in an Automatic with downshift for hill speed control. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (3121)Good guy amateur stick driver  by  charbokin  funny[+]thedeepfriedboot 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]thedeepfriedboot 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoYou have 2 feet and 2 petals. While holding the brake, apply a little gas to get the torque converter to kick in, then let off the brake. You learn that quickly if you ever have to tow trailers up a hill.

It was always interesting to head over and stare into the reactor room windows over in the old engineering building between classes.
