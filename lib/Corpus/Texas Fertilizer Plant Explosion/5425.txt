Also his blocking is really impressive, I just think it's too early in his career to say that.

Don't get me wrong, he's an amazing tight end so far but it's still too early in his career imo.

Granted, i haven't seen him play before, and actually before this year I hadn't heard of him. But from a stats perspective he looks good, but not good to the point where I could see a team selling off their best asset to clinch him.
Edit: I realize stats aren't everything and that's why I'm asking
