permalinksave[+]longhornpianist 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago  (0 children)[–]longhornpianist 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoI've heard about our crazy creationist textbook writers my whole life, yet I've gone to Texas public schools for 15 years and have never actually seen anything suggestive of creationism in a biology textbook. If I remember correctly, a fourth of highschool biology is devoted to the comprehension of Darwinian evolution. 

permalinksave[+]TXSG  comment score below threshold  (6 children)[–]TXSG -10 points-9 points-8 points 11 hours agoWe have only two options: freedom under God's law or tyranny under man's law. You choose.

permalinksave[+]Shikadi314[S] 4 points5 points6 points 11 hours ago  (1 child)[–]Shikadi314[S] 4 points5 points6 points 11 hours agoMind expanding on your reply a little bit? That sounds like a false dichotomy to me, plus I don't quite grasp how this textbook issue relates to "freedom under God's law".

permalinksaveparent[+]Disposable_Corpus 1 point2 points3 points 8 hours ago  (3 children)[–]Disposable_Corpus 1 point2 points3 points 8 hours ago...and that, children, is why we should have a theocratic monarchy. Because man's law is tyranny and True FreedomTM is only rightly expressed when all dissent is quelled and cast into the sulfurous pits.

permalinksaveparent[+]hotakyuu 1 point2 points3 points 8 hours ago  (2 children)[–]hotakyuu 1 point2 points3 points 8 hours agoDissent is best prevented with a proper education. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Disposable_Corpus 1 point2 points3 points 8 hours ago  (1 child)[–]Disposable_Corpus 1 point2 points3 points 8 hours agoAnd the only education that's proper is the one His Holiness the Emperor has ordained in the name of the Inexorable Terror.

permalinksaveparent[+]hotakyuu 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago  (0 children)[–]hotakyuu 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoYou preach blasphemy here, only things taught in the name of the One Who Is Most High King Heavenly Father are acceptable! You are praying to a false god, this Inexorable Terror. He shall be smote as is His Will be Done
