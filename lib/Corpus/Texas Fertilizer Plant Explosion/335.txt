You might just have to look around on the webs to find out for sure. Sorry wish I could be more helpful.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (83)How long do you go?  by  CuriousAmateurin  sex[+]zierark217 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago  (0 children)[–]zierark217 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoAlso don't take all this like i hook up alot or even remotly know much about women. All of this is just from my exp and is subject to change haha. Ah definitely no problem at all though. I myself am moving into an apartment and going to a university this fall. Something that helps me(especially if the girl is extremely hot) is to try to masturbate at least once that day, helps a lot. Another bit of advice coming from one of my best friends, is that if you're not sure if you want to hook up with a girl that you've been talking to or if you're not sure about dating her or really any situation sexual or not is to "always master bate before an important decision." I laughed every time he said this but it turns out to be helpful haha

permalinksavecontextfull comments (21)How long do you go?  by  CuriousAmateurin  sex[+]zierark217 0 points1 point2 points 2 months ago  (0 children)[–]zierark217 0 points1 point2 points 2 months agoWell the first time I ever had sex, it was a semi close friend and she expected it. Now the first time I have sex with a new girl after losing my virginity, it varies from girl to girl but usually Ill switch to her and start concentrating on her, sometimes ill crack a light joke about it, you know laugh it off. The most important thing to know about being a guy that the first orgasm is quick, is make sure you give her a lot of attention you know make sure she's enjoying herself. If you make sure of that then you're golden because the first quickie really isn't that big of a deal unless we make it seem like one. So as long as she's cool and  it'll be totally fine, if she's an ass about it then she's not worth your time.  In my experience most all the girls I've ever been with were perfectly nice about it, if they even noticed at all(the switch to giving her oral helps I think). Anyway I hope this helps you out, best of luck!
