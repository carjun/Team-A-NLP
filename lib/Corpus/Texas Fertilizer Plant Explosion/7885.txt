Maybe you like bath beers? I've never tried it but I'm sure it's great, because...well it's beer.

RULES: Beer label must be prominently displayed in photo. If you're drinking out of a glass/cup/mug please make it known what you are drinking.
Use the NSFW tag if your post is NSFW. If you think your post might be NSFW but are unsure, then it is probably NSFW and you should use the NSFW tag.
More of a guideline, but using imgur will help to keep your post out of the spam filter.
Please, no memes.
