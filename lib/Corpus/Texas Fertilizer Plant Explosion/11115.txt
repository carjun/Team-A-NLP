Get this: the TV networks are refusing to put GetUp members' ad on the air. Channel 7 refused outright on the grounds that it was "distasteful", while Channel Ten and Channel Nine have told us directly that they won't continue running the ad because it criticises Rupert Murdoch.And in a really bizarre twist of events, Channel 9 withdrew the approved ad from broadcast after having accepted payment for the ad spots, and haven't confirmed they'll refund the money.They're giving Murdoch a free pass while censoring our free speech. We won't let that stop us though. Can you help us make sure as many Australians watch this ad as possible? It's already been seen by more than 200,000 Australians online - like & SHARE this to keep it growing!--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- To support this campaign go to: http://www.getup.org.au/you-decide-th... Murdoch may have given up his right to vote in Australia's election, but he hasn't given up using his power to influence yours. The Gosford Anglican Church's sign perhaps said it best: "Thanks Rupert, but we'll choose our own Government." They're supported by the Australian Press Council who issued a warning to newspapers this week, saying "a paper's editorial viewpoints and its advocacy of them must be kept separate from its news columns."*News Corp employs some of the best journalists in the country, and until recently, The Courier-Mail in particular has been a reasonably balanced newspaper. But during this election campaign, News Corp Australia have consistently used the front pages of The Courier-Mail and The Daily Telegraph to launch aggressive political campaigns against one side of politics**, while failing to scrutinise the other.The Murdoch-owned News Corp publications account for 65% of national and metropolitan daily newspaper circulation***. In Brisbane, home to more marginal seats than anywhere in the country, The Courier-Mail is the only state-wide daily newspaper available. What's more, News Corp have been turning their front pages into huge political ads, installing them as bus-shelter and outdoor advertisements in key electorates. We expect news from our newspapers. We expect to hear from journalists reporting the facts fearlessly, not from editors who have been flown in to run an attack-dog political campaign. Let's send a message loud and clear: Australian voters decide this election, not Mr Murdoch: www.getup.org.au/you-decide-this-electio­n [1] Australian press watchdog chides Murdoch media, Reuters. 27th August 2013. [2] Murdoch's election coverage 'insult to Australians', SMH. 26th August 2013. [3] FactCheck: does Murdoch own 70% of newspapers in Australia? 8th August 2013.
