permalinksavecontextfull comments (2913)TIL Nickelodeon executives were worried about backing Avatar's sequel, "Legend of Korra" because it was an animated action show with a female lead character. During test screenings, however, boys said they didn't care that Korra was a girl, just saying "She was awesome."  by  Roboticidein  todayilearned[+]_DevilsAdvocate 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago* (0 children)[–]_DevilsAdvocate 3 points4 points5 points 3 days ago*It actually makes a lot of sense if you look at what the fire nation was doing in the first series. And that they've had nearly 100 years to advance that tech. The first show was basically set in the 1800's.

Or am I missing something; it seems some people just don't have that feature?
EDIT: I am wrong. Evidently I hadn't updated to the new version yet. I can see why people are upset. It's still in beta, though. :/
