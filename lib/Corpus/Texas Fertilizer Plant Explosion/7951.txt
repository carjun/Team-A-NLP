The only ranked opponent the Buckeyes face is Michigan and that's only if they don't embarrass themselves against easy teams.

They keep all their staters in for a whole game at home. While Baylor put up 56-13 AT HALF the next week and pulled out the starters after that. Don't discredit them too much.

Okie Lite has the atmosphere that can give us trouble.

It would take much for Okie to pull out. The only game I see us dropping is the Oklahoma State game. 
No way we lose to Tech unless Briles and team get carried away by sex Kliff.

It's up to you if you're wanting those things or not. If no, stick with the original.
It's worth it for me IMO.

It worked for me to view some of the BBC channels over there.

An upset is when an opponent who isn't as likely to win a game against a highly rated team, wins out. Florida State was favored by 5 points to win the game at Death Valley.
No one called the ND/Bama game an upset either even though they won big.
