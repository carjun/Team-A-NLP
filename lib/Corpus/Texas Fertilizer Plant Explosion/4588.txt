Lyrics:There's something strange going on tonight,something going on that's not quite right,Joey's nervous and the lights are bright,there's something going on that's not quite right.There's something going down that wasn't here before,keep your eyes glues to the floor,no-one's gonna save your life,something strange going on tonight.There's something going on that wasn't here before,keep your eyes glued to the floor,no-one's gonna save your life,something strange going on tonight.There's something going on tonight,something's going on that's not quite right,Joey's nervous and the lights are bright,there's something going on that's not quite right.
