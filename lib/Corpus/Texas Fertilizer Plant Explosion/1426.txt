permalinksavecontextfull comments (1885)Texas refusal to expand Medicare means you pay 100 percent of the burden while other states coast  by  sarasmootsin  texas[+]Archer1600 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago* (0 children)[–]Archer1600 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago*Yea, no thanks to Medicaid expansion. In States Like California and NY Medicaid is actually taking larger and larger portions of State's budgets. Every Year. California close to 30 and Same with NY
Eventually those States will have to start cutting seriously into their other services like Public, or Higher Ed. OR just raise taxes to even keep par with rising Medicaid costs. Worth mentioning though that those 2 are already the States with the largest debt's and biggest tax burdens. And, IF you raise taxes, that ASSUMING you actually get more revenue and there's not a recession. Because THEN, even more cuts and reduced benefits/services will have to be made. 
I'd rather not see my Lone Star State go down that path.

That's how we start it, get the conversation going. Arm yourself with facts and do power points. Talk to the local leader of the Tea Party and ask them if you can do a presentation. You'll be surprised how open they are.
