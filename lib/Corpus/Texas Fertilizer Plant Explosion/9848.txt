If the house republicans want to change existing laws, then they should make a separate bill that does that and see where it goes. The problem is, they've tried that already and they can't get it through. They're trying to use a bill funding the federal government to get something they can't otherwise pass through the legislative process. Before DOMA was ruled partially unconstitutional, you didn't see the democrats attaching language to repeal it onto continuing resolutions to fund the government. To blame this on anyone but the republicans for attaching their agenda to a bill that funds the government is ridiculous. 
They keep asking for compromise. There is no compromise to be made. Compromise is when two sides want something and each side makes concessions to the other and they come out somewhere in the middle. They both want to fund the government. The Republicans are the only ones asking for anything else. The democrats should add language to a senate bill repealing Obamacare and extending Medicare to every citizen who wants it. Then we'll see how much they want to "compromise."

Of course, the Republicans could run a convicted child molester for any statewide office, and that candidate could rape 9 children a day on live television for a year and he would still win with 60 percent of the vote.

This shutdown is the result of right-wing extremists making the Speaker of the House their bitch, nothing more.
