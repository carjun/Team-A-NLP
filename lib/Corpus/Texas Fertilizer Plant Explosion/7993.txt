I'm in HEB area. Was playing music pretty loud at the time so I didn't experience anything I was aware of. It was a massive explosion, unbelievable.

permalinksaveparent[+]strangerchan 7 points8 points9 points 6 months ago* (2 children)[–]strangerchan 7 points8 points9 points 6 months ago*sorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onDude, the shaking you felt was probably from the sheer winds we're getting from this storm front.  I mean, it could have been the explosion, but it's way more plausible that it was these gnarly winds.

I'm from a mining town, and when they strip mine 40 kms away we feel it. The earth is solid, if something gets it to start moving it moves for quite a distance.

permalinksaveparent[+]Thelasttrollstanding 6 points7 points8 points 6 months ago  (0 children)[–]Thelasttrollstanding 6 points7 points8 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onAccording to the USGS, the explosion registered a 2.1 on the Richter scale.

That explosions is pretty big, but not THAT big. An atomic bomb wouldnt even come close to reaching 85 miles, let alone this.

permalinksaveparent[+]kherven 1 point2 points3 points 6 months ago  (2 children)[–]kherven 1 point2 points3 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onLittle boy registered a 6.0 on the Richter scale.
Description of a 6.0: 

Felt in wider areas; up to hundreds of miles/kilometers from the epicenter.

So yes, someone 85 miles away from an atomic explosion would certainly feel it.

permalinksaveparent[+]thefunkbot -3 points-2 points-1 points 6 months ago  (1 child)[–]thefunkbot -3 points-2 points-1 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onExcept there are no actual recordings of Little boy on a richter scale, only approximations. An average atomic bomb is around a 4 on the richter scale. If you are going to fact check me, at least use facts please. Either way, my main point stands - it is completely impossible for this fertilizer plant explosion to be felt from 85 miles away.

You can't say something that confidently without giving me a source.

It is not even close to being possible that this person felt any signs of that explosion from 85 miles away. An atomic bomb wouldnt even reach that far.

permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago  (2 children)[–][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onHow far does a 2.1 earthquake reach? That is how powerful it was, apparently.

permalinksaveparent[+]c1202 1 point2 points3 points 6 months ago  (0 children)[–]c1202 1 point2 points3 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onNot that far , millions of 2.0-2.9 events are detected every year, I doubt people more than a couple of miles away would feel it. However thefunkbots comparison with an atomic bomb is rather silly as you'd definitely know about it (due to radiation contamination etc) but not the pressure wave created. Nukes aren't used for their pressure wave production.

permalinksaveparent[+]thefunkbot 1 point2 points3 points 6 months ago  (0 children)[–]thefunkbot 1 point2 points3 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted ona 2.1 is incredibly low. The richter scale is a logarithmic scale, so a 3 on the scale is 10 times more powerful than a 2, a 4 is 10 times more powerful than a 3, and so on. So a 2.1 is like one ten thousandth of the power  ~7 (average quake).
