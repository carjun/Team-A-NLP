If companies work with intelligence agencies on super secret spy stuff involving giving a backdoor to the government, they have to sign a shitload of paperwork. Some of it makes sur that the company would never tell anyone about anything going in. Apple HQ's could literally have a big flashy FBI sign on their front, they still wouldn't be allowed to disclose any of it before the FBI does.

Jackson missed a golden opportunity to make the Finals with a great team. He's really an asshat.

Example: DeMarcus Cousins.
No but seriously, he's my prime example of ''loads of talent, shitty mentality'' and I fully expect him to get better.

then Gilbert will spend boatloads of cash to fill out the rest of the roster.

That worked like a charm between '05 and '10, didn't it? I want to see it before I believe it.

Brandes had insisted that Meiwes attempt to bite his penis off. This did not work and ultimately, Meiwes used a knife to remove Brandes' penis. Brandes apparently tried to eat some of his own penis raw, but could not because it was too tough and, as he put it, "chewy". Meiwes then fried the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine and garlic; he then fried it with some of Brandes' fat but by then it was too burned to be consumed. He then chopped it up into chunks and fed it to his dog.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (267)Why has Josh Smith never been elected to an all star game?  by  LionDefenderin  nba[+]VictoryIsMyValentine 6 points7 points8 points 4 months ago* (0 children)[–]VictoryIsMyValentine 6 points7 points8 points 4 months ago*Because there have always been better players or players that have been just as good as him at the F position. 
LeBron has always been a lock. Pierce too. So you're already left with only 3 open spots. Bosh and KG have always been better than him. In recent years there's a locked spot for Melo. 
I won't make a whole list of them, but he was always behind the star players I listed or guys that just performed really well that one season. 
Being in Atlanta surely didn't help either, but it you look at the past selections there's nothing scandalous.

What do the Spurs have to do to beat the Heat?  by  runwithforestin  nba[+]VictoryIsMyValentine 6 points7 points8 points 4 months ago  (0 children)[–]VictoryIsMyValentine 6 points7 points8 points 4 months agoExploit LeBron on the defense end? Nah. That has never worked. The only situation this works is on fast breaks where LeBron does anything to avoid foul trouble. Use the rim for block protection or bump into him before going up for the layup.

What do the Spurs have to do to beat the Heat?  by  runwithforestin  nba[+]VictoryIsMyValentine 1 point2 points3 points 4 months ago  (0 children)[–]VictoryIsMyValentine 1 point2 points3 points 4 months agoI ways cringe when Bosh takes anything else than regular open jump shots. As soon as they're contested, that he tries to take them off the dribble or even worse to fade in any direction, his shooting % on them goes from somewhere around 70% down to 20%. He just can't do it. As soon as he starts thinking about it and 'take them to get going' he shoots bricks over bricks.
