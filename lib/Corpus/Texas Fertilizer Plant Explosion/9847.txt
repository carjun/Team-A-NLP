permalinksavecontextfull comments (64)Conservatives Claim Schools Are Trying to Defeat the Second Amendment With Liberal Textbooks  by  Vee_Veein  texas[+]IsleCook 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago  (0 children)[–]IsleCook 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoI'm not the one going against 200 years of jurisprudence, history, and appellate decisions. That is you. You are the one trying to rewrite the 2nd Amendment and turn it into a suicide pact where there is no gun regulation. You want anarchy. If your interpretation were true then why weren't all gun control laws nullified with its ratification? Why did we go over 200 years without overturning a single state or local gun control law on 2nd Amendment grounds?
The simple truth is you have been duped. You aren't alone. Conservative Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Warren Berger called the NRA's misinformation campaign on the intent of the 2nd Amendment "the greatest fraud of his lifetime."
Do a little serious research. The truth isn't hard to find if you understand how to use objective sources. I thought like you do for years until I got into an online discussion and decided to do a little basic research. I was shocked to find such a blatant fraud being perpetrated. It wasn't something I went looking for, but I couldn't deny the glaring, documented truth I found.
