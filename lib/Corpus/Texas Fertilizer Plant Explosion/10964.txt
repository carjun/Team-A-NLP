covers an already-submitted story.
violates reddit's site-wide rules.

is responding to spam.
violates reddit's site-wide rules.

Extreme or repeat offenders will be banned.

permalinksaveparent[+][deleted] 5 points6 points7 points 6 months ago  (1 child)[–][deleted] 5 points6 points7 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onMore accurate title would be "explosion in West, TX".  Yes technically West is outside of Waco, but it's still a good 15 miles north of here.  The EMS Director in West has reported that possibly 60 to 70 may have been killed.  Really sad news.
