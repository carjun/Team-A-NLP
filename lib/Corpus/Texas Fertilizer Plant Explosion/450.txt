I wanted to get the message out. People need to be ready for what is to come.

A country about to free itself  by  acmilan12in  america[+]acmilan12[S] -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]acmilan12[S] -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days agoA story came out today describing that Catholic priests were threatened with arrest for trespassing to preach the Mass. Something like that should never be disallowed. 
By the way, had Obamacare never came and had we passed a budget, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

Thoughts?  by  coldashwoodin  Christianity[+]acmilan12 -10 points-9 points-8 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]acmilan12 -10 points-9 points-8 points 2 days agoJust putting this here:
This is ILLEGAL.  This can be considered persecution of a religion. The President has no authority to do this.  Threatening an arrest if someone volunteers is also illegal.  This is disregarding FREEDOM OF RELIGION, which is illegal.
I got this news just now from my local radio station,and am 100% outraged.  Obama needs to be impeached.

A Minecraft style font would be epic, but go nuts really.  As for a theme, a chicken in a sunset would be awesome!  
Of course, the "Thanks for watching" "Subscribe" and Twitter with #ChickenOn would be included.  And if we could maybe have a "Previous Video" and a "My Channel" or "Next Video" (for Let's Plays) box to link vids in.  
Hope it ain't too much.  Basically, go nuts!

EDIT:  What I mean is, FOX actually acknowledges that they have a conservative slant.  CNN and MSNBC deny their extreme liberal slant.  They also never question, which is what intelligent media should do.  All they do is agree with whatever President Obama does/says.

MSNBC though leads in viewers over Fox (on mobile, so fact check please?) so you have an extremely liberally biased major network. But for one to say Fox is not news (I know you didn't) Is just plain ignorance and stupidity

By the way, MSNBC is very biased, and obviously biased.

Fox is news. They actually have decent news programming. CNN has been lagging behind Fox for so long. MSNBC is basically the "We agree with Obama every time and he is never wrong network"  I prefer Fox for news, even as a moderate (not R or D)
EDIT:  This got a ton of attention.  133|100.  I am amazed.  Thanks to those whom I have had good discussions with.
