permalinksavecontextfull commentsELI5: why won't flies and other insects react on sudden movements on the TV or computer monitors?  by  evenfloughin  explainlikeimfive[+]Unidan 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes ago  (0 children)[–]Unidan 1 point2 points3 points 27 minutes agoHowdy!
Lots of people have the idea in this thread!  While I don't think this idea has been particularly studied to prove that it's the case, the fact that there's very little air motion probably does not give the fly much incentive to move!  Additionally, at that scale, the picture on a television is most likely obscured and may not represent the same threat.  
Even moreso, the eyes on a fly that has already landed are often not looking down.  Flies are sensing with their legs which they clean very often, as they contain taste receptors, so flies will land on things they want to taste and eat; however, they may not be looking at them very much, as most of their compound eye and their ocelli are pointed up!
