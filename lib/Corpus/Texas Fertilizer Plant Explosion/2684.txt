Video's dedicated to Lucyhttp://youtube.com/lucyfromtheblockShe's the most amazing person, I've met here. Not only the fantastic editor with original ideas for her amvs and movies but also a great support for me :3. It's real fun to talk to her. And seriously, if not Lucy, I doubt whether I'd had come back to yt. What I missed most 'bout it was talking to her. I LOVE YOU LUCY!---Songs' names in the outro.The first one is a shortened mix of a normal and an alternative version of the song.---Okay, so yeah. Started this video a year ago (was supposed to be a present for Lucy's bday). Screwed up at making it on time, so let's say it's a gift for upcoming ones (as not sure if I'll find enough time to make sth new on 6.11).When it comes to Lucy, it's of course - a Saskay tribute! A storyline goes pretty much with the lyrics. Wanted to show how certain occurences influenced on Sasuke's life. And how unstable his psyche has become. Hope you'll enjoy the video and will like the song [one of my favs ever]! Each comment makes me go wee deep in my heart :3.And please add my backup:http://youtube.com/mightuchaaaaan
