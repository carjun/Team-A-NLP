Updated 6.53pm
OVER 1,800 ATTEMPTS to access pornographic websites were made at Leinster House in a four-month period, TheJournal.ie can reveal – though none of these applied to TDs, Senators or their staff.
For reasons of ‘privacy and confidentiality’, no log is kept of browsing data for members, so only attempts by staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, visitors, contractors and journalists are included.
Details of blocked websites, released through a Freedom of Information request from this website, include a number of escort and ‘hook-up’ sites.
Though some 3,062 blocked attempts were recorded from 17 May to 13 September 2013, 62 per cent of these were found to be related to spyware, malware or viruses.
‘Local hook-ups’
Analysis of the remaining sites, revealed attempts were made to access a number of Irish escort websites including escort-ireland.com, as well as sites aimed at finding “local hook-ups in your area”.
One attempt was made to access a website that contained images of “hot naked teenage girls”, though the website specified that they were all over the age of 18.
There were also two attempts made to visit a site that showed women performing oral sex and several blocks on a website offering live webcam streams.
However the Houses of the Oireachtas stressed that some of this data may have been generated by automatic links from other sites via pop-ups, for example, or sites that auto-refresh.
Privacy and confidentiality
The log contains only information in relation to blocked access attempts made by staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, journalists, visitors and contractors.
The Houses of the Oireachtas Service has said “no log exists relating to browsing by members, their staff or party staff” for privacy and confidentiality reasons.
There were also a number of incorrectly catagorised sites, for example, the website for St Patrick’s mental health services and a website offering support to the families of gay people.
A spokesperson for the Houses of Oireachtas said it operates a strict policy and when inappropriate usage is identified, it is investigated.
Once spyware, malware computer viruses and other technical issues are ruled out as being the cause for the traffic, these access attempts are dealt with through the formal disciplinary procedures.
It was confirmed that disciplinary action has been taken in the past where the policy has not been followed. But a spokesperson for the Oireachtas declined to give any further details.

There would be fair amount of gammy software blocking innocent addresses too. Contraception/LGBT* websites for example. In saying that, my sitestats are revealing about time & frequency people on gov.ie IP spend googling their own names!

@Price Who said I was a guard? It’s none of your business what I do for a living. Con man?!? Even if I were a con man it would be a damn sight better than what you are, you sinister individual. As for your Facebook page it has been reported by a few concerned people here. Now away into the darkness with you, you vermin.

Nice dramatic headline. “None of these applied to TDs, Senators or their staff”. “62% were found to be spyware, malware or viruses”.

Not to mention the incorrect categorisations, of which no percentage is available.

In fairness Dail committees have been asked to look at changing legislation around sex work in Ireland. Not to suggest that no one in there was looking out of personal agendas, but there actually is a usefulness in engaging with these sites if we are to understand the changing landscape of sex work in  Ireland.  For an indepth  look at the issue heres a doc released this week by The Live Register

Maybe it’s a way of trying to get someone with some entrepreneurial spirit/business acumen into the Dail??
God knows it needs it!!!

Of course Mark, one of the laws the committee proposed was to make it illegal to access those sites – so illegal, in fact, that anyone who does so will be treated in law as a paedophile.
Awfully convenient then that TDs’ and Senators’ visits aren’t logged, isn’t it?

Yes.
You can be sure the NSA and GCHQ have logs of TDs internet use — their metadata.

The article explains. It could have been journalists and contractors. Of course it could also have been TDs, senators and their staff.

Civil servants out number TDs and Senators in Leinster House. That’s who this article is referencing, as well as journalists and contractors.

answering inane FOI requests, yes.
spam filters block spyware, but breaking news – normal staff of Oireachtas *may* be implicated in something that happens in offices all over the place, but thanks to a loophole we can expose them.

I think it’s only fair that they name the “local hook up sites” for research purposes of course

“some of this data may have been generated by automatic links from other sites via pop-ups, for example”
I am sorry to burst the stupid bubble of naivety that they are pretended to be enclosed in, but rarely any work-related websites contain such type of pop-ups or advertisements. The type of sites that contain links to pornographic sites are normally sites for illegal downloads (or other pornographic sites).

Emilio, this is manifestly true, since I personally have NEVER been confronted by gateways to any such sites, over many years of internet usage.   It appears that only Judges, Policemen, Politicians and civil servants are ambushed by these evil “pop-ups” and the like.

The wife works in the civil service, she is blocked from sites like Ryanair, aerlingus, and couldn’t even receive an emailed photo of her new nephew.

I cannot believe that you use Microsoft products and never get pop ups. It virtually unheard of. Because of the constant annoyance of same some years ago I moved to Apple and the nuisance stopped immediately.

Only in terms of internet browsing. Their real histories can be cleared and forgotten with ease it seems.

Far more worrying is the poor security which does not prevent viruses and trojans from infecting pcs in a network used by the people running the country.
Other governments worry about whistleblowers to wikileaks or nsa hacking, while we do not defend confidentiality of govt business with software that would cost more than 5000 to secure all of the it equipment and servers in the Dail

How do you assume that out of this article? Assumptions make an ass out of you. That’s pretty much it in this case.

Hookups and escorts eh? Maybe it’s a cultural exchange thing..one load of prostitutes looking for advice from the other load of..prostitutes. Or it could be tutorials on working for the cameras on being ecstatic whilst hating the people you’re working with and selling it to the viewer. Whatever it is, I know which lot are the more honest and it ain’t the politicians.

There is no story here. Sounds like a stitch up if anything. Furthermore its pretty much fair to say there’s most likely not a computer in the land that’s owned by an adult that doesn’t have some form of smut on it. Crap story, next!

http://www.Pixalert.com can identify exactly which member of staff or login account is viewing illicit pictures. It is the same software used in a Bank a few years ago. Pictures can be hidden in Word documents, but the software can detect if the hidden picture is pedophile, sexual or just children playing on the beach. No pop-up links would be identified as user specific.
Multinationals use the software to ensure corporate governance and compliance, which unfortunately our Government fails to apply to themselves.

http://www.stpatricks.ie – also pornography.
Strange false positives being detected by an over sensitive firewall.
Notable that legitimate websites are being defamed by the publication of this list.

Are we sure the TDs weren’t just trying to drum up an income stream for screwing over the country by adding it to the list of Hookers for hire. I mean, seriously, the Troika didn’t even buy us dinner first…

Does that figure include pop up’s that were blocked. what i mean is is a pop up, pops up and is blocked is that recorded as an attempt to access something which is not permitted?
