April 18 (Bloomberg) -- A large explosion struck Adair Grain Inc.’s fertilizer facility in the town of West, Texas, killing an unknown number of people and injuring at least 100, authorities said. Local media reported as many as 70 people may had been killed.The blast occurred after 7 p.m. local time yesterday following a fire at about 6:30 p.m. at the site, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Dallas, West Mayor Tommy Muska told reporters. Trooper D.L. Wilson, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a separate conference that an unknown number of people had been killed, at least 100 were injured and that as many as 75 homes had been destroyed.“We’ve got a lot of people who are hurt, and there’s a lot of people, I’m sure, who aren’t going to be here tomorrow,” Muska said, saying that his town of about 2,800 residents needs “your prayers.”Adair Grain’s DBA West Fertilizer Co. is an anhydrous ammonia facility, according to Wilson. In 2001, 29 people were killed following an explosion at Total Fina Elf SA chemical plant in southwest France, which injured hundreds more and damaged schools, hospitals and homes.Local television station KWTX cited West EMS Director George Smith as saying as many as 70 people had died in West. Television images showed fires in the ruins of the plant and in surrounding buildings, and people being treated for injuries on a flood-lit sports field. Radio station WFAA said the blast had registered as a magnitude 2.1 earthquake.Eyes Burning“We are monitoring developments and gathering information as details continue to emerge about this incident,” Texas Governor Rick Perry said in a statement. “We have also mobilized state resources to help local authorities. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of West, and the first responders on the scene.”Jonathan Moore, 30, a truck driver felt the blast from about 35 miles to 45 miles north in the town of Itasca. He said he heard a loud boom and saw the walls shake inside the truck stop he was in at the time of the explosion in West.“All of a sudden I could see the walls move both ways,” Moore said in a telephone interview. As he and his friend drove closer to the explosion on Interstate 35, the smell became so strong their eyes started burning, Moore said.“You just could tell it was bad,” he said.Investigation TeamThe U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which investigates industrial chemical accidents, said on its website it deployed a “large investigation team” that should arrive today.Two hospitals in Waco were treating about 150 people, according to local media, with other patients sent to neighboring areas.“We’re seeing some folks that were very seriously injured this evening, unfortunately,” Glenn Robinson, chief executive officer of Hillcrest Hospital, told CNN. “They’re blast injuries, orthopedic injuries,” he said. “A lot of lacerations, a lot of cuts.”Calls to the Waco McLennan County Emergency Management office weren’t answered. Messages were left with the after-hours number for the Texas Department of Public Safety.West was named after a local business owner, Thomas West, and attracted German and Czech immigrants at the turn of the 19th century, according to the The Handbook of Texas Online.--With assistance from David Wethe in Houston.
