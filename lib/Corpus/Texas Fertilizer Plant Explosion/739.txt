I visited Cindy's doctor on a walk-in visit to get a second opinion on my knee and diabetes. I never knew that - Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent kind of arthritis, affecting more than three million Canadians.And then there's diabetes in Canada -  Today, more than 9 million Canadians live with diabetes or prediabetes.Approximately 10% of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes. The number of people with type 2 diabetes is increasing dramatically due to a number of factors:The population is aging.Obesity rates are rising.Canadian lifestyles are increasingly sedentary.Approximately 80% of people with diabetes will die as a result of heart disease or stroke.Diabetes is a contributing factor in the deaths of approximately 41,500 Canadians each year.In the next 15 years, it is anticipated that the global incidence of type 2 diabetes in children will increase by up to 50 per cent.
