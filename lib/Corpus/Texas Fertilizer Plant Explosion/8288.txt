permalinksavecontextfull comments (6457)The New Look /r/saskatoon!  by  ztiin  saskatoon[+]Decateron 5 points6 points7 points 13 days ago* (0 children)[–]Decateron 5 points6 points7 points 13 days ago*As far as technical problems go, on large monitors such as my own, the /r/Saskatoon button is visible twice since the background is set to repeat. This can be fixed by setting the background to no-repeat, and gradienting the right side of the image towards a solid color, as seen on subreddits such as /r/boardgames. 
As far as design goes, I don't really think that this feels like Saskatoon. If you want to do something easy, you could copy subreddits like /r/seattle and use a panorama of the city as a background.
Concerning the /r/Saskatoon button, I think that you should move it up so that it's in line the with reddit logo, adjust the edges so that there are equal margins on all sides of the text, and replace the black box with a less obtrusive color, or reduce the opacity or something. I'd also like it if you changed the font, but that's just personal preference.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (52)What was your 2nd boardgame? - the one that you bought after research when you realized that boardgaming can be your hobby. Were you happy with your educated choice?  by  b4bin  boardgames[+]Decateron 4 points5 points6 points 16 days ago* (0 children)[–]Decateron 4 points5 points6 points 16 days ago*The first modern boardgame I purchased was Small World, as I was trying to get my friends to finally move away from Risk. After that, towards the end of 2011, I got my hands on 7 Wonders. The game remains one of our groups favourites, still getting at least a few plays every other week. I only recently picked up the Leaders expansion, but even without it, our group would still be playing 7 Wonders. It's not my favourite boardgame anymore, but it definetally has gotten the most bang for its buck. It works well as an introductory game for new players without boring veterans, and supporting 7 players is a pretty big plus since our group usually ranges between 4-7 players.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (576)[WSIG] Decent party/large group game that's playable while getting progressively inebriated  by  pollodelamuertein  boardgames[+]Decateron 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]Decateron 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoI've found that 7 players is the sweet spot for Avalon. When I organized a game night with 10 players it became too hard for everyone to keep track of all of the voting and roles. This wasn't a result of anyone being inexperienced, since aside from the one new player, everyone else had played at least 20-30 games. The problem was that there were just too many things to keep track of properly and so most of the mind games and role cards fell by the wayside. It's still a pretty good game without the meta, but it's not the type of game that would get 80+ plays like 7 player Avalon has with my group.

Whoever did this just faded back an earlier part of the song, so there's a jumble of notes being played and the flow is completely lost.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (42)As much as I like the developer, I just cannot get in to Naughty Dog's games.  by  AmnesiaCanein  truegaming[+]Decateron 25 points26 points27 points 2 months ago* (0 children)[–]Decateron 25 points26 points27 points 2 months ago*This is a problem I've been having with many story-oriented games in the past generation. Games like Mass Effect 3, Bioshock Infinite and The Last of Us just feel like a chore to play. You just sit behind cover killing wave after wave of enemies just so I can reach another cinematic and progress the story. It's gotten to the point where I avoid AAA singleplayer games because I can't be bothered to sit there for 10 hours just to get a few hours of story that's less interesting than a movie.
There was a talk by Jonathan Blow where he talked about the human condition in relation to video games. I wouldn't really say it's worth watching but I'll link it here anyways. The signifigant part of this talk to me was when he asked if a game were stripped down to its fundamentals - so all story, graphics, music, etc. were removed, would it still be fun? I would definately answer no to this for Bioshock, Last of Us and Mass Effect. The actual gameplay, which is the majority of the game, isn't interesting or engaging at all. I think it's stuff like this that has been pushing me more towards indie games for the past couple years since good indie games don't draw out the game to make consumers feel like they got their $60 worth. Once they've finished exploring whatever mechanic they've created, they're fine to just let the game be done, so you don't feel like you're retreading ground.

Maybe we got a bit lucky, but I don't really find the game to be all that strategically deep, especially when you have multiple people working together.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (552)Games you bought and played once or twice  by  darguskelenin  boardgames[+]Decateron 18 points19 points20 points 2 months ago  (0 children)[–]Decateron 18 points19 points20 points 2 months agoFlash Point. I'd be happy to pull it out, but my gaming group isn't interested in cooperative board games. My biggest gripe with the genre is that the challenge comes from randomness and so when you lose it feels like you just got unlucky rather than getting outplayed.
It also probably doesn't help that we beat Flash Point on our first and only playthrough. Since it's cooperative and there isn't any evolving metagame, everyone thinks that we've essentially beaten the game.

The delay between the caster talking about a player and the spectator moving to him and selecting him would be more annoying to me than a camera that is moved around poorly on the map..

permalinksavecontextfull comments (382)Poor Draskyl..  by  Arrow2Neein  DotA2[+]Decateron -8 points-7 points-6 points 2 months ago* (0 children)[–]Decateron -8 points-7 points-6 points 2 months ago*Dota 2 and StarCraft 2 are not the same though. In Dota 2, there are multiple points of contention almost constantly whereas StarCraft usually has one, maybe two if there's a drop going on. Because there are many points of interest at once in Dota 2, which I imagine would result is that the camera would often be desynchronized between the spectator and the casters. In many ways it would be like using the autocam while listening to a caster. The visuals wouldn't match the commentary and it would probably end up feeling like a lower quality production, even if you are capturing all of the action or it moves a bit more smoothly.
