They were there that night because regardless of what happened, it was a big night in his career.

[x-post from r/soccer]  by  ChetLemonin  SquaredCircle[+]AmishAvenger 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes ago  (0 children)[–]AmishAvenger 0 points1 point2 points 3 minutes agoVince wanted Bret to go to WCW. Vince said he couldn't afford to pay him anymore, and wanted out of their contract. 
I don't believe it was a work, but that's the reason. 

permalinksavecontextfull commentsOne of my favorite scenes in Star Trek. Sisqo's outburst at the end of the DS9 episode "Far Beyond The Stars".  by  vivinpin  startrek[+]AmishAvenger 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours ago  (0 children)[–]AmishAvenger 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours agoHah...that's an interesting thought. He poured his soul into the character, and was left as a bizarre man strolling about in a dream world once the show ended.

Hopefully he's able to stick with it.  I don't think he'll really miss anything by not seeing the episodes I left out.  

permalinksavecontextfull commentsWhat episode/season of TNG is best to start with for a newcomer to Star Trek?  by  gonnaglein  startrek[+]AmishAvenger 2 points3 points4 points 9 hours ago* (0 children)[–]AmishAvenger 2 points3 points4 points 9 hours ago*I've written this before--this is a list of what I think are the most important episodes of the first two seasons. Most everything from Season 3 on is gold, with the odd stinker here and there. TNG is mostly episodic, so there aren't a lot of serialized episodes, but I still think you should go into it knowing what's contained in these episodes. None of them are particularly bad, so I think you'll get through them just fine. 
Encounter at Farpoint (essential)
The Naked Now (good for characterization)
Where No One Has Gone Before (a good "exploration" episode, sets up some later stories)
The Battle (some backstory on Picard)
Hide and Q (I don't think any episode is bad with Q in it)
The Big Goodbye (nice intro to the holodeck)
Datalore (essential Data backstory)
Skin of Evil (you'll see why)
The Neutral Zone (early setup to a big story in later seasons)
Elementary, Dear Data (awesome episode, sets up a later one)
A Matter of Honor (good intro to Klingons)
The Measure of a Man (on many "best of" lists)
Q Who (a must-see episode)
In my opinion, those should be the bare minimum. I'm sure others may add or subtract from that list, but I don't think you'll be bored or put off by any of those.

We don't exactly know what led up to the murder of Nancy. 
But I don't need to know what the reasons were behind the murder of Daniel. Nothing can excuse that. Nothing can lessen the gravity of killing a child.

Possibly. I wish he'd said that, though. WWE tends to pretend Smackdown doesn't exist.

Plus, OJ never murdered a kid. As far as the criminal justice system is concerned, he didn't murder anyone.

On Smackdown, Heyman got pissed that the interviewer asked about what was going on with Punk. He mentioned that her engagement had ended, asking her how she liked having personal business aired in public. 
On Raw, Heyman said he's avoided Punk all week because the issue should be aired publicly, not in private.
Don't get me wrong, it was an awesome segment, but the logic behind its taking place was a little thin.

They're going to watch the product regardless and at the end of the day, WWE is a business.

No one seems to remember the real victims here: Nancy and Daniel. 
You make a good point about the Hall, which relates to DVDs and the like as well. How would "paying tribute" to Benoit be fair to other wrestlers who didn't murder their families?  Him going in the Hall takes away a spot from someone else. And why should he get a DVD and not someone like Davey Boy?
