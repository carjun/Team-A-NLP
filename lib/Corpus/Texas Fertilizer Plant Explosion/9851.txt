(self.ADHD)submitted 1 day ago by new2austinHi guys, 
TLDR
new to texas, need to find pharmacy that has out of state prescription plan filed with department of public safety so I can stay with my doctor. 

I recently relocated to texas from colorado. I've been working with the same doctor for the past 4 years.  I take adderall 10mg once a day. Anyways, I can't fill the prescription from my doctor in colorado unless the pharmacy has filled a plan for filling out of state prescriptions with the DPS. I know a few of these pharmacies exist, I've spent hours calling and searching, but I keep getting stone walled. 
Does anyone from texas know of these pharmacies, or how I could find them? I also tried calling and emailing the DPS, but that could take a while. 
I know I could just go off my meds, but these have really helped me and I use them responsibly. I went from college drop out to productive graduate with a well paying job, through the help of my medication and doctor's therapy and hard work. I'd like to not have to change what has been working so well for me, if at all possible (seeing a different doctor etc.)
Thank you very much

I only suggest it since its not a well known Pharmacy. I know they don't fill my prescriptions from the doctor without both authorization from the doctor and a written prescription that they pick up themselves from local doctors using a courier service, but that is for a pain medication, they may so it for adderall, they even offer a service where they ship the prescriptions to you (but for a schedule 2 or 3 medication you or an authorized person would have to be there to sign for it)
Also why can't you find a new psychiatrist locally? You could get your old doctor to transfer all your records so you won't have to get diagnosed again, and so you can go in for appointments for refills and if you ever need to adjust the dosage or something? My current psychiatrist (in garland if your in the area) diagnosed me quite easily and I just go in every 3 months for refills, it's not much of a hassle, and may be worth t if you can't find a pharmacy that will take out of state scripts. 

permalinksave[+]new2austin[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]new2austin[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThank you! I am looking at getting a doctor here, but I have worked with this doctor for the past four years. And yes what you have with your doctor would be ideal. I am a couple hours away, but I would make the drive every three months. 
Thank you very much for both the reply and the pharmacy suggestion, I will call tomorrow. Appreciate it mate.

permalinksaveparent[+]Evilbluecheeze 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]Evilbluecheeze 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoAh yeah. Unfortunately QVL locations are only open Mondays - Fridays, something like 8am - 6:30pm, they're dickish like that, so you'll have to wait until Monday to call, you can go to QVL Pharmacy to find locations, numbers, and hours. 
And I could PM you my psychiatrists website if you really wanted, but I would recommend calling around to local psychiatrists and maybe asking if you could forgo the testing and whatever other hoops you usually have to jump throgh normally, if you have your current psychiatrist send over your records or whatever they need, again, only if you can't find a pharmacy that will help you, hopefully you can. Good luck!

Thank you very much for your help!

I'm a native Texan, studying in virginia now for college. I don't know if this is something you can do. I had a script for ritalin from my doctor in Virigina. Took it home over spring break to get filled, no luck, went to 7 different places. 
It's probably easier to find a new doctor and have your old doctor mail your stuff to Texas. 

permalinksave[+]Vee_Vee -4 points-3 points-2 points 1 day ago  (3 children)[–]Vee_Vee -4 points-3 points-2 points 1 day agocome on bro, this the most pathetic drug fishing I've ever seen. 

permalinksave[+]new2austin[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago* (2 children)[–]new2austin[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago*Sorry you think that. If this is the most pathetic drug fishing you've ever seen you must live a pretty sheltered life. I used to drive through detroit and flint michigan every month, crazy shit. 
I have a prescription, take it responsibly, have worked with the same doctor twice a month for the past 4 years to help manage my ADHD and depression that I've struggled with since I was little. I'm not sorry that I want to continue a treatment that has helped me significantly, and part of that is getting my medication and trying to stay with the same doctor. Have an upvote anyways.
