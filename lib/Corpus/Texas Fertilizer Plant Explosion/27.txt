                                                                Posted Apr 18, 2013 @ 11:22 AM

                                                                

                                                        

	Amphibians were the first animals with backbones to crawl out onto dry land some 360 million years ago. Their descendents, the frogs, toads, and salamanders, still survive, although for many species, their existence is threatened. The presentation will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday, April 20 at the Ted Markham Nature Center at Mossy Bank Park in Bath to hear Broome Community College professor, Dr. Victor Lamoureaux, discuss the status of our local amphibians, see some representative specimens, and if you wish, join Dr. Lamoureaux on a walk through the woods to see what we can find. A great way to spend an Earth Day weekend morning! The program is free to the public.
