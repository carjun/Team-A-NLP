                20 April 2013

                    A church in a rural Texas town is holding its services in a field since its usual building is blocked off due to a massive blast at a fertiliser plant.

Families and firefighters in tiny West have packed church services on the first Sunday since the West Fertiliser Company plant exploded on Wednesday night.
First Baptist Church remains in a barricaded area where the damage and rubble are most pronounced.
So Pastor John Crowder has instead set up folding chairs in a field and delivered his sermon from the flatbed of an 18-wheeler truck.
Meanwhile, assistant Texas fire chief Kelly Kistner said that all fires have now been extinguished at the explosion scene and the remaining fertiliser tanks are not a danger.
At least 14 people died in the blast and 200 were injured.
