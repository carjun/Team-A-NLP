permalinksave[+]im_a_middle_childborn and bred 13 points14 points15 points 1 day ago  (8 children)[–]im_a_middle_childborn and bred 13 points14 points15 points 1 day agoIt's also about insurance. If they have licenses they can get insured and we have fewer hits and runs, accidents with no insurance. Collectively, our rates go down and everyone is generally more protected. 

permalinksaveparent[+]chechnyatx  comment score below threshold  (7 children)[–]chechnyatx -8 points-7 points-6 points 1 day agoYou think for one second they'd actually get insurance? What a naive little person you are. 

permalinksaveparent[+]im_a_middle_childborn and bred 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]im_a_middle_childborn and bred 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoI think if someone is going to go through the trouble of getting a license, they'll probably get insurance. Dick.

I think

That's where you went wrong.

permalinksaveparent[+]jgnbigd 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours ago  (0 children)[–]jgnbigd 2 points3 points4 points 22 hours agoNobody gets a license without having proof of insurance.  So, yes, they would get insurance.  I much prefer that scenario to the one right now--no license and no insurance.  

permalinksaveparent[+]sniffing_accountant  comment score below threshold  (0 children)[–]sniffing_accountant -6 points-5 points-4 points 1 day agoI know right. Illegal immigrants are just gonna walk into the DMV/DPS, and get an ID, and then get insurance. It's not like they have any desire to remain under the radar...

permalinksaveparent[+]Vyseloreborn and bred  comment score below threshold  (1 child)[–]Vyseloreborn and bred -7 points-6 points-5 points 1 day agoLmao amen. Why would they, they've gone this long without the extra cost. Don't use common sense, it's not welcome in this leftist circle jerk and is bound to get down voted. Just watch. 

permalinksaveparent[+]cranktheguy 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours ago  (0 children)[–]cranktheguy 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours agoYou must have proof of insurance to get a driver's license. Sorry to leftist circle jerk you with actual facts.

permalinksaveparent[+]Boinkology 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Boinkology 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoPlus you actually have to pass a driving test to get a license.  Not a bad idea...

permalinksaveparent[+]Allisonaxeborn and bred 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]Allisonaxeborn and bred 7 points8 points9 points 1 day agoThis was exactly my thinking and I came to say the same thing. If we get them into the system, we can track them... And as if they're going to go and get an ID card (and volunteer to be tracked) if it didn't afford some privilege, like driving. 

permalinksaveparent[+]MrRonGalvanborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]MrRonGalvanborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoI haven't gotten a policy myself, but do you need to use your social security number to get insurance? 

permalinksaveparent[+]Msshadow 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Msshadow 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoSort of.  Most companies like to do credit checks before giving you a policy.

permalinksaveparent[+]Elmattador 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Elmattador 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI guess the problem would be, if they've gone without one for so long, why get one now? 

permalinksaveparent[+]IsleCookborn and bred[S] 6 points7 points8 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]IsleCookborn and bred[S] 6 points7 points8 points 1 day agoHaving undocumented workers with a drivers' licenses and insurance is far more sensible than the alternative.

permalinksave[+]Shikadi314 7 points8 points9 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Shikadi314 7 points8 points9 points 1 day agoSounds pretty reasonable. 

permalinksave[+]Vee-Vee  comment score below threshold  (0 children)[–]Vee-Vee -12 points-11 points-10 points 1 day agoRacist Rethugs won't support this.  They want Texass to be their Neoconfederate stronghold.
