permalinksavecontextfull comments (102)I just donated blood. "Jack" received my blood and then a very short time later committed a crime and left a drop of blood at the scene. Would my DNA be in that drop of blood, possibly implicating me in the crime?  by  Wishyouamerryin  askscience[+]BubbleBobble-007 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]BubbleBobble-007 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoI think, in general, there is a slight stigma regarding donating marrow because while the donor may have a philanthropic mindset, the hospital still ends up charging the recipient for access to marrow that they acquired essentially for free.
Making donations to a private business that makes insane profits, and then having that business sell your donation is a bit of a moral conundrum imo.

Kind of semi-relevant.
Also, within reason and common sense, what the FAA doesn't know won't hurt them.

You might already be aware of this, but I had to make sure.

The only thing is those two terms are pretty much applicable to injection molding in general. I might be more inclined to say curing time and temp because rubber injection molded parts can become scorched easily.

I don't think it's too big of an issue. 
In any case, a person could just throw a collapsable strike plate in front of the tumbler that would break the plastic key and not the metal one. Easy fix.

And it's watching you.  by  cocomojo4991in  videos[+]BubbleBobble-007 0 points1 point2 points 27 days ago  (0 children)[–]BubbleBobble-007 0 points1 point2 points 27 days agoI don't think the issue is one of processing power but more so developing more efficient algorithms. You might be surprised to learn how ridiculously inefficient many computer processes are just because they can afford to be that way without sacrificing performance.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1011)World's highest resolution camera is 1.8 gigapixels. And it's watching you.  by  cocomojo4991in  videos[+]BubbleBobble-007 2 points3 points4 points 27 days ago  (0 children)[–]BubbleBobble-007 2 points3 points4 points 27 days agoThis system is essentially Gen 2 of the Gorgon Stare project. The mechanics of the system were largely in place prior to the start of ARGUS-IS project. ARGUS-IS primary $18,500,000 mission was to refine the algorithms used in the Gen 1 system, which it supposedly did. 
So I'd say it's safe to assume that the $18.5 million spent on algorithm research probably turned out some pretty innovative processes, at least in the sense that the algorithms developed are so superior to regular compression algorithms that they require far less computing power to process.
