Emeril visits the Eden Roc Hotel, where he and Chef Paula DaSilva try some of the restaurant favorites, and then the two whip up a clam dish together. Afterwards, Emeril heads to "Ortanique on the Mile" in Coral Gables, where he and Chef Cindy Hutson try and eat some of her favorites, including crispy fish tacos with a twist. He then travels to the Epic Hotel and eats some of "Area 31's" finest Mediterranean-inspired seafood dishes with Chef Michael Reidt. Emeril visits Vizcaya and the Miami Seaquarium, and then shows a glimpse of the nightlife in Miami.
