What city was that in, because the sign on the freeway kinda looks like the Sam Houston Tollway logo.

... and take it (the tailgate.  He dared me to, after all!)
(And then return the tailgate the next day.  I'm no thief.)

permalinksave[+]PunjabiPlayagot here fast[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (8 children)[–]PunjabiPlayagot here fast[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoactually it's all one piece as part of the tailgate

permalinksaveparent[+]rammalammadingdong  comment score below threshold  (7 children)[–]rammalammadingdong -13 points-12 points-11 points 2 days agoOh God, so its a fucking plywood tailgatethat has been painted? I love Texas but not your Texans. When Obama was reelected I went on about 50 newly spawned FB pages and made fun of the idiots who wanted TX to secede. None of them had any type of plan for any type of govt, or how the hell they would get people or businesses that disagreed to just leave. It just made our great state look like a bunch of fucktards and I'd bet this guy is right at the top. I'd also bet he'd say he's a bigger patriot although he's the one up and ready to leave. I directed all of them to websites of companies that sold islands and told them that they should practice on an uninhabited island before they took on a challenge like TX. Fake ass patriots make me want to vomit. 

permalinksaveparent[+]PunjabiPlayagot here fast[S] 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago  (5 children)[–]PunjabiPlayagot here fast[S] 4 points5 points6 points 2 days agoI agree with you. But you're over-generalizing Texans. All of the urban counties are blue. It's just that the crazies are louder than the normals. Ignore them instead of enabling them.

permalinksaveparent[+]rammalammadingdong  comment score below threshold  (4 children)[–]rammalammadingdong -16 points-15 points-14 points 2 days agoI'm not "over-generalizing" anything. If you think a guy that has "come and take it" on his tailgate is a Democrat, you are sorely mistaken. 100 dollars says he's a TeaBagger. I'm not empowering idiots, I am making fun of them. 

permalinksaveparent[+]PunjabiPlayagot here fast[S] 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago  (2 children)[–]PunjabiPlayagot here fast[S] 4 points5 points6 points 2 days agoI didn't say he was a Democrat. He also has that big ass Republican Texan bumper sticker. I'm at least moderately liberal and I love the "come and take it" part of Texan culture and history. Yes there are still plenty of good ol boys in brodozers rolling around. But as far as demographics of the urban population in Texas, it's turning more and more blue.

permalinksaveparent[+]rammalammadingdong  comment score below threshold  (1 child)[–]rammalammadingdong -11 points-10 points-9 points 2 days agoI never said it wasn't turning more blue, I was just pointing out the fact that the guy is obviously not. For the record, I've never once seen a come and take it sticker alongside an Obama sticker. I was siding with fact, not speculation. 

permalinksaveparent[+]bornandbred -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]bornandbred -4 points-3 points-2 points 2 days agoI appreciate the generalizations, I figure that is what people think of me, but I am about as far left as one can go. I have thought about adding stickers touting my liberalism and atheism, but decided to keep it just about Texas. The other stickers are "Native Texan", one for Lone Star Beer, and the one on the back windshield is "HOU" for Houston, the best city in the state.

permalinksaveparent[+]lonestarbeer 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]lonestarbeer 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoI've had a come and take it tattoo long before there was any "Tea Party" bullshit going on.  
Some of us have a healthy knowledge, love, and respect for the history of this great state.
