Advantages:
1. Good keywords that are indicative of content. 
IMP: 
Interesting questions:
a) threshold wordLength for indicative words? 
b) Can we do an intelligent search which filters out uninformative words? ( uninformative = stop words )
2. Bigrams are interesting. 
3. Better indicative words if we compare with word frequencies. Different from 1 (b)
Few representative words show what Could be indicative words in the text.
Filter out other words...

Disadvantages:
1. Most of the words are useless(?). Need to filter out prepositions etc
2. Need to process more - stemming, lemmatisation etc. 
With stemming - whale vs whaling are two different words. 
Whaling gives a different inflection to the text content.
3. Will not work for short articles...? 
Question: Will it work for short articles?
