The relationship gives the city access to needed classrooms and provides revenue for the cash-strapped Catholic Church at a time when parochial school enrollment is declining. 	This year the city Education Department will pay more than $27 million in rent for 40 public schools housed in parochial school buildings. And when it comes time for required sex ed instruction, kids at those schools go off site to facilities owned by the city or to local nonprofits. 	State law enacted in 1987 requires city schools to administer lessons on HIV/AIDS to every student in each grade at least once a year. In 2011, city officials mandated sex ed lessons, as well, for all students in either sixth or seventh grade, and again in either ninth or 10th grade. 	City parochial schools require sex ed lessons starting in the seventh grade that are aligned with church teachings that favor abstinence. 	But the policy is unpopular with parents, who argue the church oversteps its bounds by forcing tenant schools to take students off the premises for mandated lessons.
