The killer detonation flattened buildings in a four-block radius around the plant. 	Officials put the death count at anywhere between five and 15 and the number of injured at 160. 	The search for victims and two to three missing volunteer firefighters continued amid a scene of shocking devastation. 	The firefighters immediately began moving workers out of the chemical-filled plant, which held tons of ammonia, among other chemicals. 	Firefighters were also working to evacuate the area around the plant when the blast sent flames shooting into the sky. Scalding hot embers and debris rained down on frightened residents, who ran for cover. 	Anyone who could help rushed to evacuate the nearby West Rest Haven Nursing Home, hustling 133 patients, some in wheelchairs, to safer locations. 	The burned-out fertilizer factory was still a search-and-rescue site and there was hope for more survivors, police said.
