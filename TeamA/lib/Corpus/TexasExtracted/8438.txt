In a village in northeastern Afghanistan, it's just past eight in the morning at Islam Begs house, and the family is already curled up around a burning opium pipe. This village Sarab has a population of fewer than 2,000, and half are already addicts.  There are very real steps that state and local government could take that would make the drug war toothless. You are 100% wrong. There is NOTHING state and local governments can do to stop Federal agents from raiding businesses like dispensaries. States can't immunize against Federal prosecution. You're focusing on cops on the street prosecuting individuals. Go back and read what I wrote, which has nothing at all to do with that level of enforcement.  Check out this story and explain to me how well Oakland "made the drug war toothless." It also has other impacts. For example, while the Federal laws remain in effect, no bank will do small business loans to a pot-based business for fear of being charged with criminal money laundering, among other things. Or just check out a '63 Corvette against a '59 Corvette against a '70 Corvette etc etc. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
