Tsarnaev. 	An eerie image captured before the deadly Boston Marathon blast may show one of the suspected bombers walking past an 8-year-old boy who was killed in the explosion. 	A boy who looks like Martin Richard appears in the image standing at the railing beside the road. A young woman to Richard's left claps her hands, perhaps cheering for the athletes. 	Unbeknownst to them, a white-capped man who appears to look similar to the second suspect being hunted by authorities on Thursday lurked only a few feet behind them. The image also suggests that a backpack possibly containing the explosive was left on the ground at that moment. 	A heartbreaking image of Martin holding a sign he made in school last April, after a lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin, was widely circulated, touching the countless people mourning his death worldwide. 	The man in the white hat however, identified as Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, left unscathed. He can be seen fleeing the scene in another photo, as the young lady who stood near Martin and Jane races through the streets beside other horrified pedestrians. 	Tsarnaev is still at large and believed to be "armed and dangerous." But his suspected accomplice and brother, Tamerlan Tzarnaev, 26, who wore the dark baseball cap, was shot dead.       On Thursday, astronomers announced in two different studies that NASA's Kepler telescope had spotted three far-off planets that could potentially support life.
