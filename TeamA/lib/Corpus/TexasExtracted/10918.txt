Welcome to r/WikiLeaks. This sub is for all news and questions related to WikiLeaks and their founder, Julian Assange. To the best of our knowledge, none of the posting members or moderators have any connections to WikiLeaks or Assange as this is merely a news and discussion section. Crossposts from other sub-Reddits are more than welcome. Also, for those who don't know, you can view the most, if not all, of the archives from their original site at the link below.  NOTE: Do not post links or how-to tutorials on how to join cyber attacks against those who oppose WikiLeaks. This is counterproductive to the cause, and detours discussion about WikiLeaks and the information they release.
