It is possible the deaths and injuries from the West explosion could eclipse the 2005 BP Texas City refinery explosion that claimed the lives of 15 workers and injured 100. At last count there were14 dead and 200 injured. The multinational oil company set aside $1.5 billion to settle lawsuits and pay fines, a process that took four years to work through the legal and regulatory systems. But compared to the deep pockets of BP, the West Fertilizer Co. is very small potatoes in terms of its resources and insurance coverages. BP reported $237 billion in sales in 2012, compared to $4 million for West, according to Dun& Bradstreet. This explosion was a bigger crime than the explosions at the Boston Marathon yet it has received about 1% of the media attention. This place had more violations than Lindsay Lohan's driver's license. Typical of Texas, lax oversight, which is what Texas means when it says it is "bid-ness" friendly. "Bid-ness" actually runs Texas, so they have a lot voluntary compliance policies. Works great, doesn't it? @roknsteve cuz, he's Rick Perry's biggest donor. Remember the GOP saying, "Rich people create death, I mean jobs".
