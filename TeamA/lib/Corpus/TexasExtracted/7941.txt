1: DO NOT post links to movies that you didn't like (ie. "Inception was the worst movie because it was popular") and try not to post movies that are completely unwatchable with no redeeming value. We're here to be entertained by these movies. 2: If its not on IMDB don't post it. I'm sure there a subreddit for your homemade youtube movies but this is not it.   3: No "This" submissions. Please state the movie, director or subject you are linking to in the title. The exception would be self posts or posts asking questions. 4: If you know where the movie can be viewed please add the streaming service in brackets "[]" next to the name.   5: Please do not post direct links to torrents, links to full length movies, or downloads of copyrighted material (unless the link is to the Copyright Holder's official page/channel).   This subreddit is for obscure movies where things like bad special effects, ludicrous stories and terrible acting make them hilarious to watch. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
