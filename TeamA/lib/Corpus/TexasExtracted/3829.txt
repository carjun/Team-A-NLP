West, Texas, continues grim search in wake of fertilizer explosion - latimes.com                                             Valley Mills Fire Department personnel gather near the fertilizer plant that exploded in West, Texas.  Among the dead are expected to be 12 firefighters and first responders who arrived to fight a raging blaze at the West Fertilizer Co. when the blast occurred. Authorities also sought to remove additional bodies from a nearby residential complex. Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Jason Reyes told the Associated Press that it was "with a heavy heart" that he confirmed a dozen bodies had been pulled from the area of the plant explosion in West, about 20 miles north of Waco. The removal of the bodies began late Thursday as local firefighters lined up to pay respects to the dead as they were brought from the rubble, according to the Waco Tribune-Herald. Workers also found two bodies in the adjacent residential complex, the newspaper reported. On an overcast morning, Jacki and Pete Arias drove with their 8-year-old son Samuel from Waco toward West, hoping to get past police barricades to their home about a half-mile away from the fertilizer plant. The community reached out to its own Thursday as residents donated food and other items. Many waited in line to give blood. Everyone did what they could, a fact that was highlighted in an morning newspaper editorial in West.                 Um, you do realize that there are oil refineries in Torrance and Carson that are surrounded by residential communities?It's not like this is a situation unique to Texas.                 Why are there schools and residential properties in such close proximity to a dangerous facility or is that just how they do planning in TX? TX should take more care in such matters.
