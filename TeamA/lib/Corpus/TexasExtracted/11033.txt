CNNBattered Town Seeks Missing After Explosion Kills at Least 5 New York TimesDisaster Declaration Sought for Texas Blast Zone Wall Street Journal A blast at a fertilizer plant in the small town of West, Texas, raises concerns about exposure to anhydrous ammonia, a potentially deadly gas that is stored at high pressure.  A smaller fire at the plant apparently spread and caused an explosion when the flames came in contact with some of the tanks containing chemicals for the fertilizer. If not handled properly, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, anhydrous ammonia can cause eye, nose and throat irritation, breathing difficulty and burns. Although the ammonia is colorless, it carries a strong odor, which health experts say is the simplest way for people to know if they have been exposed. The odor makes it fairly easy for Fire Department responders to monitor for presence of the gas, says Langerman. And so far, Waco police say the air in West does not pose a health threat: Alexandra Sifferlin is a writer and producer for TIME Healthland.
