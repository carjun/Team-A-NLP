Blast raises questions about ammonia plants in IowaPerry Beeman and Donelle Eller, The Des Moines Register11 p.m. EDT April 18, 2013Four people were killed and 18 injured by an explosion at Terra Industries chemical plant on Dec. 13, 1994, south of Sioux City, Iowa. The explosion released a cloud of dangerous chemicals that forced the evacuation of about 2,500 people in four Nebraska towns and sent shock waves 30 miles away.(Photo: AP)Story HighlightsAmmonium-nitrate plant explosion in Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, killed 4 in 1994Iowa OSHA chief says safety protocols, designs have improvedAmmonium nitrate popular as fertilizer because of high nitrogen contentDES MOINES, Iowa -- The Texas fertilizer plant explosion  has raised new safety questions about three ammonia plants being considered in Iowa and brought back memories of a deadly 1994 blast.The explosion in the small Texas town of West, about 20 miles north of Waco, killed as many as 30 and injured more than 160, city officials said.Could Iowa be risking  a similar disaster?Or will the new fertilizer-manufacturing facilities planned for Sergeant Bluff, Wever and possibly Mitchell County be safer than older plants?The Terra Industries ammonium nitrate plant in Sergeant Bluff, south of Sioux City, exploded after an equipment malfunction on Dec. 13, 1994, killing four and injuring 18. Some 3,000 residents of Iowa and Nebraska were evacuated. Ammonia gas wafted off the site for six days.Better safety protocols and design changes are now in place, Iowa OSHA Administrator Stephen Slater said Thursday."All kinds of technologies have had huge improvements," Slater said. "And we haven't had any bad experiences at the plants in the 20 years since Terra. I'm knocking on wood."And, Slater noted, large fertilizer plants are also now subject to an extra set of safety regulations that include meticulous requirements on which equipment is used and how it is replaced.Such plants often use ammonium nitrate as a fertilizer because of its high nitrogen content, which promotes plant growth. But the chemical can also explode under certain conditions, and was the explosive used in the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 in 1995.The potential for explosions has raised concerns in Iowa. Already operating in the state are the reconstructed former Terra plant, now owned by CF Industries, and a Koch Nitrogen Co. facility in Fort Dodge.In addition, plans have been announced to the expand the rebuilt Terra plant in the Port Neal complex near Sioux City and to build a second large fertilizer plant in southeastern Iowa near the Lee County town of Wever.Mitch Doherty, who lives less than a mile from the planned Lee County plant, worries that it could present problems that his community hadn't needed to be concerned about previously."Not only do you have the facility, but you've got the trains and trucks hauling chemicals all the time," Doherty said. "You'd hope that this plant would be more modern, safer."But Doherty said Lee County supervisors and representatives of Iowa Fertilizer Co., the company planning the project, have offered only vague reassurances when asked about safety issues."That little town in Texas, it's about the same as us, Doherty said. "You look at something like that, and think 'holy cow,'" Doherty said.A spokeswoman for the project's parent company,  Orascom Construction Industries of Egypt, declined to comment on the Texas explosion or safety protocols it intends to have in place at the Lee County plant.CF Industries did not return calls or emails. The Deerfield, Ill., company plans to invest $1.7 billion to expand the former Terra plant.There also has been talk of a possible third fertilizer plant to be built in Mitchell County in northeast Iowa near the Minnesota border. Cronus Chemical LLC has reportedly been in discussions with Iowa development officials who would provide it with $35 million in tax incentives to proceed with the project.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency collects "worst case scenario" documents from such plants and monitors their emergency preparedness plans.A spokesman for the office in Lenexa, Kan., Kris Lancaster, said because of the varying condition at different plants, his staff can't say how wide an area would be evacuated if one of the Iowa plants exploded, or how large a crater might be left.If another explosion were to occur, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources would decide how big an area to evacuate, based on air temperature, humidity and the amount of gas released. The area would cover miles.Barbara Lynch, who has worked in the DNR's environmental protection offices for 35 years, said she knows of only one large-scale fertilizer plant explosion in Iowa, the Terra plant.Rodney Tucker, a member of the DNR emergency response team, said all three of the large plant sites in Iowa are within coverage areas served by hazardous materials squads.Labor Commissioner Michael Mauro said the Texas tragedy  forces decision makers at the state and federal level to refocus on safety issues."This will draw the attention of lawmakers and regulators," Mauro predicted.
