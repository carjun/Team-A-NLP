Upstate New York mother-of-two Lisa Franklin, 44, is accused of having regular sex sessions with the boy in her car in various parking lots across the area. 	The alleged affair came to light in February after the parents of the child, who is now 13, found inappropriate text messages between the pair on his cellphone. 	New Windsor Deputy Police Chief Rick Hovey told YNN the exchanges were "not something you'd see between a 13-year-old child and a 44-year-old woman, that's for sure". 	Cops in Newburgh say Franklin, from Wallkill, has two teenage children of her own and worked as a substitute teacher at Sacred Heart School until the spring of 2012. 	Taking a liking to the boy, a student at the school, Franklin befriended his parents - persuading them to let her become his personal at-home tutor. 	Hovey said the boys parents had "trusted she was acting as an adult and doing the proper thing" but instead"sexual intercourse [AND]oral sex would occur in a car". 	She was released from Orange County Jail after posting $10,000 bail and is expected back in court later this month.
