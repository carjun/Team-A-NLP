As far as I know the game doesn't try to save your progress locally so the worst that would happen would be one lost play session while they update. And if they correctly implemented some kind of graceful countdown-to-shutdown logic on the client-side (which I have no confidence they have done considering the current state of online, but which I have seen in other titles such as Planetside 2) the data for current play-sessions could even be saved before the servers go down. Isn't that what a map is? I.e. online maps are indeed maps, just with extra data visualization layered above them? In the course of the investigation, conducted in concert with a police officer and the school division Office of  Safety and Loss Control, we identified the children who were firing pellet guns at each other and at people near  the bus stop. Several students verified that they had been hit by pellets and had the marks to support their  claims. In one instance, a child was only 10 feet from the bus stop and ran from the shots being fired but was  still hit. Another student claimed to be shot in the back while running away during a previous incident  students were on their way to or at a school bus stop when they were struck by pellets, the school division has  jurisdiction to take disciplinary actions against those students responsible for the disruption. There is an  expectation that all students should be able to travel to and from school in the safest environment possible. Still, you're right that the stealth aspect at least for the fort is underdeveloped, as it seems pretty random whether someone will see you or not. The thing is, the game is so far ahead of any other game in so many other ways that it's hard to justify giving GTAV less than a 10.0 if you have previously given any other game a 10.0. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
