An LPT is a tip that improves your life in a meaningful way. Share your best tips you've picked up throughout your life! Prefix your submissions with LPT:. If you don't we'll presume you never read the rules, and your post will be subject to removal. No LPTs about Facebook, Reddit, Bebo, Myspace, Friendster, Geocities, Twitter, or any other social networks (with the exception of LinkedIn). Don't post LPT "lists" (e.g. 50 Things Every Man Should Know). Additionally, don't post links to long articles. Refrain from putting profanity in the title (although within the post body is fine). Downvote posts you feel aren't LPT worthy and report rule-breaking posts to notify mods. Need a LPT for something in particular? Start your thread title with: LPT Request. LPT allows mainly text only posts. Want to earn karma? Crosspost your tip to AdviceAnimals we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
