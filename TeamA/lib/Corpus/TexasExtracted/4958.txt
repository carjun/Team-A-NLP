Feel like giving a random redditor a free pizza, but don't know how or who?  Well this is the right place for you!  Random giving is why we are here! However, we are not a substitute for r/foodpantry or r/assistance. The overriding rule is to be nice. No calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. If you have a problem message the moderators. Not following these rules could result in a ban. If giving, post everything (except private information) publicly.  Private messages are exactly that, private. If you have information on a potential scammer, report it to the moderators.  No random witch hunts. created by Gadiantona community for 2 yearsmessage the moderatorsMODERATORSGadiantonsnangTarablemcredsonOliverTw1stkai908AutoModerator1156157158(Request) For hospital workers and first responders in the waco area setup for tomorrow.

From a fellow Texan and redditor Thanks for everything this sub does.  This has became my fav sub in just one day.   I can send only a $10-20 giftcard ($10 can't even buy a small pizza here), I don't know how much it'll help but I hope it at least makes someone's day marginally better.

A big thank you to everyone involved in assisting with relief. You are all amazing and make me so proud to be a part of RAoP. :) They also said their biggest needs at Blair Cove Apartments are undergarments, socks, laundry soap, and towels. Either purchase an eGift card for the pizza company and pay online using that, or ask to speak to a manager and explain to them. Between the two subs it should be smoother.
