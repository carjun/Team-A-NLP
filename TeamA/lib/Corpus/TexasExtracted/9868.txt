The Meteor Book does a good job at defining a folder structure. if there was something like Meteor Lite with the current folder structure, and Meteor with a defined large app layout I would be so happy. While I don't believe there is anything terribly wrong with smaller government, I think that there does need to be an entity with oversight.  I don't really trust a company that is sheerly out for profit to be looking out for my best interest as a consumer.  My best example are the telecoms/ISP's.   I believe that if there is a genuine community effort to better itself, it will be successful.  That is most certainly a utopian idea. Similarly, capitalism should work in a perfect world.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a utopia and we must come up with this balance of oversight to capitol freedom.  I am not in favor of massive tax rates so the government will brush my teeth for me.  I am in favor of combining resources across our country to offer the best possible solutions.   I hope that was at least somewhat coherent.  I'd love to hear your thoughts on libertarianism and what you favor in regards to smaller government. I've currently got some stuff wired up with bootstrap3 but none of it is themed.   As a side note: To save some money I would consider just setting up virtual box until you get something you want to share with the world. As far as the cost effectiveness I suppose it depends on how much you would pay for parking/fuel.  You're probably looking at $2.50/day or $50/mo (business days).  I think parking downtown generally runs about $60-$150/mo depending.  The upside of driving is you will definitely get there faster.  The downside is you will want to murder all the other drivers.   we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
