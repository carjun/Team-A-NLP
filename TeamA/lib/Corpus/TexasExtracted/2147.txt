I have a neighbor who had to have shoulder surgery after a "gentile" deer got done with him. The way I describe it is that there is no way I can get a blade as sharp as a factory and it is just not a sharp.  This dullness I guess pulls the hair out a little so that your next pass is able to sever the whisker closer to the end of the root without having to push down the skin. Be warned though even these may not go in the ground if it is hard enough and it will be some hard pulling no matter what. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
