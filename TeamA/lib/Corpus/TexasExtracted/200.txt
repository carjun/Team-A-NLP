Rick Perry says search and rescue operations have been largely completed in the small town where a fertilizer plant explosion killed 14 people and injured about 200 others. Flanked by local officials, Perry told a Friday afternoon news conference that all affected buildings in West had been cleared with possibly the exception of one burned home. Officials had said earlier that they had searched and cleared 150 buildings by Friday morning and planned to examine another 25 during the day. Federal investigators will continue searching the wreckage of a Central Texas fertilizer plant into the weekend. That will delay indefinitely the return home of residents displaced by the evacuation of much of the town of West after the Wednesday blast. The investigators are inspecting the wrecked West Fertilizer plant to collect debris and other evidence that may point to a cause of the blast that killed at least 14 people. About 200 people were injured. The blast also injured more than 200 people and destroyed about 50 homes nearby. Adair said one of his own plant employees was among the dead. He was among the volunteer firefighters killed fighting a fire that led to the explosion. Speaking Friday morning at a news conference, Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Jason Reyes said authorities have searched and cleared 150 buildings. They still have another 25 to examine. Please Note: You may have disabled JavaScript and/or CSS.
