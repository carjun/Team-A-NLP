I'm old and well remember the insane rivalry between Brian Clough and Don Revie, and even when they left the respective clubs and Mackay and Armfield took over, the clubs detested each other from top to bottom. I'm glad those days of sheer hatred are long gone, but it's still the fixture I want us to win as much as any other (perhaps bar one). Make the most of young Will, because someone is going to come in with a wheelbarrow load of cash, either in January or at the end of the season, and he will end up at a top 4 Premier League team. Scrap the House of Lords - and shoot the parasitic chinless fuckers while you're at it. Mind you, back when Brian Clough was in charge and we had just been promoted to the top division in 1969, I remember going home on the bus one night and partially heard a report on the radio about a new player we had signed. I remember being bitterly disappointed when it turned out that it wasn't Tommy Gemmell as I had first thought, but Archie Gemmill. The one thing about Clough's stint in charge at Derby was that he had the evil eye over his dad's former employee and arch-enemy. Personally, I would have liked it to continue until it reached 44 wins (one for each day Brian was in charge at Elland Road) but last night's McClaren-inspired comeback does at least give me some hope for the future after Clough. we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
