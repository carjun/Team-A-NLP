I had friends in highschool that started smoking pot like cigarettes before we even had driver's licenses.  I saw them at a 10 year reunion and HOLY CRAP, no motivation, NONE, all un-employed, still living at home or on someones couch, none had gone to college.  Speaking and trying to hold a conversation with any of them was almost impossible.  It was quite unusual, but slightly entertaining.   we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
