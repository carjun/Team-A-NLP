Now, however, the two-time Indy 500 winner and his partner, Julianne Hough, are pegged by many viewers to win the "Dancing" title.  "It's been amazing," Castroneves said. "I never thought I would be able to get this far. My goal in the beginning was not to be the first eliminated."  With Hough, Castroneves has been able to win over the judges - and, more importantly, the voting viewers - week after week.  "It's hard to believe that he is a racecar driver and not a pro dancer," wrote a fan called "grandmadancer" at ABC.com. "Not only is his dancing right on, but his performances are great. He deserves to go all the way."  Hough is no slouch, either. Last season, with speedskater Apolo Anton Ohno as a partner, Hough guided the pair to the "Dancing" crown.  "It's out of my element," Castroneves said of dancing. "I listen as much as I can to my partner. She's amazing. This is her territory.  "She also pushes to the limits to see how far I can go," he added. "She sees that, and when she sees I'm beyond my limits, she changes it to make it a little better."  Thanks to their performance on the show, and a voting campaign helped by those inside the auto racing world, Castroneves and Hough are in the finals alongside Marie Osmond and partner Jonathan Roberts and Melanie Brown with Maksim Chmerkovskiy.  "I'm very shocked," Castroneves said. "It's totally out of my territory. Racing, that's what I've been doing all of my life. Performing, acting, I didn't think I'd be able to do it."  However, he has brought the same intensity to "Dancing With the Stars" as he does to racing on the Indy Car Series.  He came into the show wanting not to be the first to go - a common feeling among "Dancing" participants - and now he doesn't want to leave at all.  "At the beginning, I wasn't worried about it," he said. "I thought, hey, it's a TV show. I was doing the best I could. Now, I'm not only so close to the finals, I've become friends with everyone. I don't want to get kicked off."
