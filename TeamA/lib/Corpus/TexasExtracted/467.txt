He'll lose it, never be able to work again, and may face jail time and/or extreme fines.

Something is wrong.  Here's to hoping they figure it out sooner than later. Getting all kinds of errors, it tells me it can't find my characters, the start screen is grayed out... The lawyer, looking quite annoyed at the loudness of it all, stands back up and says loudly, "Quiet! All of y'all knock it off with all the talking.  And that's enough with all the cussing and shit!" And I don't give a fuck HOW MANY people are working on this shit.  When the head guy is gallivanting around instead of leading his team on a game that thousands upon thousands of people PAID FOR but can not play, it's a slap in the face to hear how "sorry" he is over and and over again and then to see his fucking smiling face...ugh.   I'm just fucking PISSED.  They took my money and don't give a flying fuck that I can't play the game.  I have seriously been patient and patient and patient for over a damn week and there is STILL no end in sight.  I'm fucking going nuts.  we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
