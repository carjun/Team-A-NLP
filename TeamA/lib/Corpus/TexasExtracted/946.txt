A horny hockey mom already convicted of sex with her son's 16-year-old teammate was granted a mistrial Thursday on charges she also fondled a 13-year-old player. 	The southern California jury deadlocked 10 to 2 in the follow-up trial because of a discrepancy in the 13-year-old's testimony, a juror told the Orange County Register. 	Last August, a jury convicted Kathia Maria Davis, 45, of four felonies related to the older boy but failed to reach consensus on felony sex charges related to the younger one. 	The divorced mother previously admitted she slept with her son's 16-year-old pal, claiming she thought the boy was 18 when they had consensual sex inside her Laguna Niguel house on multiple occasions between July 2010 and July 2011. 	She denied having sex with the 13-year-old boy, claiming she actually rejected his advances when he tried to kiss her while drunk. 	The second mistrial declared Thursday centered on prosecution claims that Davis had a sexual encounter with the 13-year-old for more than an hour in the same room as her sleeping children, The Register reported. 	Davis faces a maximum of five years in prison for the previous convictions. Her sentencing is on hold pending resolution of the sex case involving the younger boy. 	The investigation began after the 16-year-old boy told his mother of the illegal affair, a spokesman with the Orange County Sheriff's Department previously said. 	"We received complaints that she was throwing parties for members of the hockey team and other friends of her son and providing them with alcohol," the spokesman told The Register. 	Both boys were members of the youth hockey team Beach City Lightning, the same team as Davis' son.
