The deal with the development outfit known as Kingsbridge National Ice Center (KNIC) features a promise that all jobs at the facility will pay a living wage, but the city has not ratified the pact, reached late Thursday. 	The so-called Community Benefits Agreement that KNIC honchos agreed to includes a series of commitments that promise to boost the local economy. 	The promise to staff the facility entirely with workers who would be paid a living wage would be one of the first such commitments for a major redevelopment project in the city. 	The 50,000-square-foot community space was also a major concession by KNIC. In addition, the firm guaranteed that 51% of the jobs that are created would be given to Bronx residents. 	Also, KNIC has pledged to create opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses, and allocate priority ice time for borough schools, among other provisions. 	The project would bring an estimated 1,800 construction jobs and create about 200 permanent jobs. 	Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. has long hailed the plan as a major opportunity for the borough.
