Do you live near any hackerspaces? We get people coming into ours a lot to work on wood projects that they do not have the tools/space to do at home. Great place to get tools you might not normally have.  Also, you may want to let people know which space you are in, or at least put up some direction signs. There are 3 units in the building. You will probably be in the north space whereas we are in the central space. Anyway, welcome to the building! we use and disclose information to prevent people from abusing the platform, but
