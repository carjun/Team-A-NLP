This was the 3rd time I had seen him and this was my favourite so far!  I loved the set up of the stage, the lighting, the 'showcasing' of the musicians, and of course, Josh's unscripted and always funny, interaction with fans!  It was also cool that a guy called "Todd" proposed to his girlfriend and Josh really entered into the 'spirit' of the moment. ( I wonder if he'll get an invite to their wedding!! )I also very much enjoyed the duets he sang with Judith Hill - magnificent!  I have often watched Josh sing "The Prayer" on YouTube but it was such a delight to hear it "live"!!I attended this concert with my daughter it will always be a very special memory for us. Thank you so much Josh!!! ﻿Read moreShow lessAdd a comment...Josh GrobanShared publicly  -  2013-10-22 #daytripping On my way to you, Grand Rapids. #daytrippinghttp://twitter.com/joshgrobanRead moreShow less118315 commentsFerrera Mary+010 Reply Tancks Josh Groban!

the touchstone artistry that has made him a global pop star for more 
than a decade and expanded his ambitious reach into richly rewarding new
 territory.  The inspiring first single “Brave” shows off his 
accomplished, personal songwriting as one of seven songs on the album he
 co-wrote. And inspired choices of other’s songs, from
 the Academy Award-winning “Falling Slowly” from the movie and Tony 
Award-honored spin-off Broadway musical Once to Stevie Wonder’s “I 
Believe” through his continued explorations of the poetry of Spanish 
(“Un Alma Mas,” featuring Cuban-born trumpet great Arturo Sandoval) and 
Italian (“E Ti Prometterò,” a duet with Italian star Laura Pausini), 
spotlight his singular talents as a masterful interpreter.   
Working for the first time with producer Rob Cavallo (the Warner Bros. 
Records chairman whose production credits cover Green Day’s many 
groundbreaking albums, Goo Goo Dolls, Fleetwood Mac and many others), 
Groban pushed himself to fully capture the spirit of his acclaimed 
concerts, fueled by his vibrant bond with legions of his fans, the famed
 Grobanites.  “The album was really sparked by an energy I had on the road,” he says. Any of the hundreds of thousands who saw his shows in support of 2010‘s
 Illuminations, in which his writing and ambition took full flower, 
knows what he’s talking about. Those concerts were at turns playful and 
intimate — even in arena settings —  and affectingly powerful, with 
equal measures of musical virtuosity and spirited, spontaneous 
personality. The latter has also brought him a rising career in movies 
and television, with an hilarious recurring guest role on The Office, a 
sparkling part in the hit Steve Carrell/Julianne Moore film Crazy, 
Stupid, Love  and a as costar of the upcoming small-ensemble comedy 
Coffee Town.  “I thought, ‘This is the energy, the dynamic I want for my next record, the feeling I’m getting on stage,” he says. 
 When he and Cavallo had dinner after a show in Chicago to discuss the 
possibility of working together, it was clear right away that they had 
the same things in mind.  “When Rob came out to Chicago he 
basically shared the same adjectives with me that I had in my head,” 
Groban says. “I wanted this to be soulful, wanted it to be righteous and
 dynamic and inspirational and energetic. And mainly wanted to find the 
sweet spot of my singing voice again. I always find it on tour.” 
 To achieve this, Cavallo — the 1998 Grammy Awards producer of the year —
 devised a creative studio approach. Though as a producer he’s best 
known for his rock work, he’s had a greatly wide-ranging career and, he 
notes, was raised immersed in the classical world thanks to his 
opera-loving grandparents — Luciano Pavarotti was a family friend who 
would visit, drawn largely by his grandmother’s cooking. The chance to 
bring all those worlds together in one project was a challenge he 
relished.  Working at the famed Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood, 
he started with an all-star core band: drummers Matt Chamberlain and Abe
 Laboriel Jr., the latter having just come off the road anchoring Paul 
McCartney’s band; bassist Chris Chaney came from Jane’s Addiction; 
in-demand guitarist Tim Pierce joined with credits ranging from Madonna 
to Dave Matthews, and keyboard player Jamie Muhoberac has worked with 
the Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Seal, My Chemical Romance and many 
others. To this, the producer added the secret ingredient, a trio of the
 top orchestral session artists in L.A. in cellist Dane Little, 
violinist Charlie Bisharat and harp ace Gayle Levant.  And then, to provide as fertile an environment as possible, he gave them and Groban a sense of complete freedom. 
 “We tried this experiment,” Cavallo says. “We got the best — the best 
guitarists, keyboards, bass, drummers, and then got the best harpist, 
cellist and violinist in L.A. and got them to play together so they 
would be sensitive to each other. We tested it out, didn’t know if it 
would work. And it worked great! Everyone had to listen to each other 
and react and play accordingly. Josh was the leader. Everyone’s 
chemistry came together at that time. Really made for passionate vocal 
takes. What you’re really getting now is a very pure type of truth from 
Josh. Very pure.”  Arrangements were worked up collectively, 
 “The rhythm section came in ready to rock,” Groban says. “The 
orchestral guys came in controlled, and the nice balance was the that 
the rock guys brought out a real edge in the orchestral players and the 
orchestral players brought out a real sense of control and nuance to the
 way the rock guys would play. To see Abe Laboriel play with a harpist 
was great! And Gayle said that it hasn’t been since the Sinatra days 
that they were able to improvise with a rhythm section. So when they 
said to me, ‘Your mic is ready,’ it made it inspiring for me to sing on 
top of that, add my element, the three worlds blending together.” 
 Most of what’s on the album was from the first few takes of each song, 
with the spontaneous spirit intact. Even the full orchestra parts, added
 later, expanded directly from the music created by the three strings 
players in the initial sessions.   And the vibe extended outside the studio. 
 “It’s a musical camaraderie, not just showing up for a gig,” Groban 
says. “That all starts at the top with Rob. And it wasn’t just the 
playing, but the joking around and the dinners — we all got to know each
 other so well. Sometimes that magic that happens when you’re off the 
clock, so to speak, when you’ve technically done your job but think you 
can do it better. Got that extra oomph from everybody.”  It went
 literally outside the studio in the case of “Hollow Talk,” a song that 
originated with the Danish indie band Choir of Young Believers.” It’s a 
song of complex musical turns and intertwined emotions, building from an
 intimacy to a big, expansive sound with orchestra and bagpipe. Groban 
remarked in the studio that it brought out the vision of a lonely girl 
walking down the street — and engineer Allen Sides, inspired, took a 
microphone out onto Sunset Boulevard to record street noises.  
“We’re hearing the cars go by and going, ‘I don’t know why this would 
work,’ but it really does,” Groban says. “And it turned out awesome.”
 Groban was inspired to push himself as a writer, expanding on the 
achievements on Illuminations, the first album to be centered on his own
 compositions. “Brave” saw him team with long-time collaborator Tawgs 
Salter and singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk.  “When Rob was 
saying, ‘Let’s widen the lane,’ you still don’t want to sound out of 
your element,” Groban says. “‘Brave’ represents one of the higher energy
 songs, but never felt out of place to me. Never felt this was out of my
 world. It represents the kind of energy I had on stage. I would want 
the lights going crazy and the band rocking out and something that blows
 the hair back and moves me. This to me represents every adjective Rob 
and I thought of in that meeting in Chicago.”  The lyrics and 
melody for “Below the Line,” co-written with Salter and Simon Wilcox, 
were formed on the day Groban participated in Life Below the Line, for 
which people subsist on $1.50 for a day in order to understand the 
levels of true poverty.    “It was not fun,” says the singer, 
whose own Find Your Light Foundation has focused on much-needed arts 
education programs. “A can of beans was my food, half in the morning and
 half at night. Somehow a song came out of it. It’s not necessarily the 
full message of the song. The vibe is, ‘We’re not helping ourselves 
until we’re helping others.’”  Another regular collaborator, 
Lester Mendez (who also produced two songs on the album), teamed with 
Groban on “False Alarms” and, along with Salter and Italian lyricist 
Marco Marinangeli, “E Ti Prometterò.” For a second Italian song, 
“Sincera” he reunited with acclaimed producer-composer Walter Afansieff 
(who produced the song) and Marinangeli.   Such personal bonds 
and connections abound throughout the album. Groban and Irish 
singer-songwriter Glen Hansard, co-writer of “Falling Slowly” and 
co-creator of both the movie and  musical Once, have built a friendship —
 the musical even includes a winking joke at Groban’s expense and the 
singer introduced its segment at the Tony Awards show. Laura Pausini, 
Groban says, “was the first global superstar I ever met,” an encounter 
that happened when he was just 17 and attending the MIDEM conference in 
the south of France. A friendship grew and both kept hoping there would 
be an opportunity to collaborate, which finally came with “E Ti 
Prometterò.”   A few years back, Groban found himself sitting 
next to one of his heroes, iconic writer Jimmy Webb, on what turned out 
to be a harrowingly storm-tossed New York flight. Here, he steps up to 
tackle Webb’s “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,” a song of complicated 
emotions that has tantalized with past interpretations by such stars as 
Judy Collins and Linda Ronstadt. And the haunting traditional Irish song
 “She Moved Through the Fair” came to him while “having my late-night 
glass of wine and trawling YouTube” via a live solo version by English 
folk-rock legend Richard Thompson, another long-time Groban favorite. 
 “Having grown up on Irish music, I thought, ‘Let’s give it a try,’” he 
says of the song, which has also been recorded by artists including Van 
Morrison and Sinead O’Connor. To give it the right tone, Levant switched
 to Celtic harp and Groban brought in another old friend, Eric Rigler, 
virtuoso on the Irish Uilleann pipes. “After writing sessions, trying to
 be clever, it’s nice to be reminded by songs like this that just sit in
 a place that’s right.”  And to tie it all up, the album ends with the Stevie Wonder classic. “Talking about the light and dark and trials and tribulations of love, 
no one writes about that better than Stevie Wonder,” he says. “It’s 
about how imperfect we can be, how many lessons we can learn. ‘Even 
though I messed up in the past and have done things wrong, the next time
 love comes my way, I’m not going to let go.”  Groban’s voice 
brings a truly personal stamp to the song, with the band and full 
orchestra joined by a full gospel choir. And the end of the song again 
captures the spirit that fueled the whole of the All That Echoes 
sessions, with Groban drumming (!) and singing a “big, stupid finish, 
unabashedly saying, ‘There it is!’”  “To me,” he says, “after 
all the messages we put on the record, there was no better way to start 
than ‘Brave’ and no better way to finish off than this.” LinksYouTubeJosh GrobanOther profilesOfficial WebsiteTwitterFacebookYouTubeMySpaceFriends Of Josh GrobanFind Your Light FoundationWe were unable to fetch any YouTube videos at this time.
