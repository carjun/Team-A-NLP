I vaguely remember a 3rd grade class talking about rainforests getting burned so they could be used for farms. 
AAAAH ALL THAT BEAUTY

THE TROPICAL RAIN FOREST
Wait. If the lumber gets used in a building and the land is used for farming, then it turns land with a net contribution of 0 to land with a net contribution of something.

It's a stylistic choice that is perfectly appropriate for things like signs or old timey printing presses with no other options for fonts, but people who grew up with computers only use quotation marks for "sarcasm".

You should look into that.  I did not and would not vote for McCain or Romney. 
I would have gladly served overseas in a just war. But that's not what happened.

It was tough to find a private place to jerk off, I didn't want to tell anyone else about the scraper bowls because then I'd have to deal with people poking their head over the top of the scraper bowl looking for a place to jerk off. The scraper bowl idea was ingenious.

You're being a dick.
Here's what I think happened: You're young. You were too young to enlist prior to 9/11 and all the wacky shenanigans that ensued. By time the recruiters started sniffing around, there were a couple bullshit wars on and you got to analyze American foreign policy with different information than I had. You got to take all these events in without having any real stake in them. 
I remember exactly what I was thought of American foreign policy in April of 2000, when I enlisted. Do you? Were you shaking your tiny fist over our questionable foreign military actions since Korea?

Do you think that because I enlisted, I don't have the right to think a politician made a shitty call? I served in the military, so my opinions on military actions are invalid?

I don't understand people who think my opinion is worth less than that of someone who's never served.
