permalinksavecontextfull comments (15)What are some samples that YOU spotted on your own  by  rkuhlerin  hiphopheads[+]BURNS_the_kid 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago* (0 children)[–]BURNS_the_kid 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago*I think there's an Adele - Skyfall sample in Waka Flocka Flame - Judge For You. Caught this because my employer plays Adele and other mainstream stuff 24/7. "Best of the 80's, 90's, and today" type shit.
Not really a sample but I had a huge epiphany because I heard the song at the beginning of Curren$y - Breakfast (this video sounds like a re-done song or something, not the original). I had never knew what it was until I heard the real one years later. The song at the beginning is The Girl From Ipanema

I had an enemy hex one of my minions (gave it 0/1 and taunt), next turn I concealed it (stealth for 1 turn) and he just attacked me over it.
