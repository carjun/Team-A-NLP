Rule of thumb, leave out one of the subjects in the sentence "she presented ... I with this." and figure out which one sounds better.

But that's usually people on big, black, lumbering bikes, not fucktards on buzzy wheels. Hey, mutual respect and concern for each other's safety, what a thought. Finding yourself suddenly surrounded and crowded by a swarm of assholes who try to coax you off the road so they can do their stuntz? Different ball game altogether.

Am i the only one here who thinks the driver of the suv is at fault?

Yup.

this is often done to try and slow an erratic driver down so the rest of the bikes can pass and we can continue the collective ride safely. 

It's not the job of a mob of bike riders to police other people's driving. Especially not if said mob is ignoring every traffic law on the book before, during and after. And the mob doesn't get the right of way just because they're a mob. Look at us being fucktards on buzzy wheels, everybody should just stop and get out of the way so we can pop wheelies on a public highway.

Blast me for it, but racial stigmas do exist.

Then by all means, continue re-enforcing the stereotypes. That's helpful.
I've been swarmed by them before, abeit in much smaller numbers and I didn't have wife and kids in the car. Suddenly out of nowhere a group of assholes on bikes doing stunts all around me, crowding me as we were doing 70 in a 60, yeah, totally my fault if one of them would have gotten bumped around some. They behaved like bullies in a mob that was riding against all rules of law, courtesy and safety.

When you insert the foreign disk into you Mac's DVD drive, OS X or the built-in DVD player app will still moan. The DVD drive will read the disk just fine, it just won't play the movie on the disk unless you change the region code.  Just ignore it and let RipIt do its thing
