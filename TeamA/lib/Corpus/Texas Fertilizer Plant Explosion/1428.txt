(self.texas)submitted 11 hours ago by hforlifeI'm a fifth-generation Texan (Houston) that hasn't lived in Texas since I was 18. College in Boston and then I've been in Hong Kong ever since. I'm curious to hear what other Texans are up to outside of the state and how they feel about it. 
Where are you? What are you doing there?
How long have you been gone?
Do you explicitly plan on coming back to live in Texas?
How do you like living where you are, and how does it compare to life in Texas?

I'm a Waco resident who just moved away from Texas this past February. My answers are as follows:
1.) I'm in Charleston, SC. Back in February I enlisted in the Navy, and am here training to become a nuclear reactor operator. In May, I'll either stay here for another 6+ months or move to Albany, NY for further training. After that, who knows?
2.) Already answered that.
3.) I'd like to, but after I'm done with my time in the Navy, it really just depends. I would like to eventually pursue a Ph.D in nuclear engineering, and I would like to attend Texas A&M for that.
4.) I ride a motorcycle (a lot), and the main difference between South Carolina and Texas I have noticed is there is nowhere fun to ride because all of the scenery is blocked by pine trees EVERYWHERE. It's also strange because in the area around Waco is vast open land with farms and ranches. Here, I live just a few miles away from the beach! After living in Waco for 18 years, that is quite a shock.
