Stupid YouTube destroyed the timing but whatever...Random vent video.M'gann and KF's reactions to Artemis dying. In the end, the likelike simulation traumatized the three and they ended the day wishing things could go back to the way they were so that they didn't feel such pain.M'gann and Kid Flash obviously had the most painful reactions to Artemis dying. It tore KF apart and shocked M'gann so badly that her subconscious released a telepathic wave that convinced everyone the training simular was real.I love this episode and I didn't think this would be the kind of tribute I'd make from it, but here you go. I guess I'm just sad because I have to go home in a couple of days.
