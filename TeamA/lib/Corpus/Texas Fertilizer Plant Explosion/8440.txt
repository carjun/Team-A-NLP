I know it's a stressful environment and people get jaded after a while (especially in consultation firms) but I'd definitely keep this as one of the last possible options.

In the past, they have found people's places of work and called to let their boss know how they spend their free time.  by  Sureiyaain  rage[+]Halbruder 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour ago  (0 children)[–]Halbruder 4 points5 points6 points 1 hour agoNo dude, he just crafted a fictitious scenario for comedic purposes... come on.

They only change the front end and bug fix... which is why xeroxes are shit. Always and only buy HP and Canon.

permalinksavecontextfull commentsIT Jobs?  by  thisguy5313in  Waco[+]Halbruder 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Halbruder 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoThat's weird man. I have 6 years experience and I get contacted about once or twice a week for something around Waco. Make sure you are on linkedin and your skills section is amazing. I ask the majority of the recruiters why they contact me and they say because my skills section is so fleshed out.

permalinksavecontextfull commentsIT Jobs?  by  thisguy5313in  Waco[+]Halbruder 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Halbruder 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoThis should be clarified as "There are no entry to low mid-range IT jobs available in Waco". I get headhunted constantly in Waco but mostly for IT Manager and Sr Admin jobs. If you're looking for something lower than that you'll have to fight with all the other kids straight out of tstc but there's a major gap in this area for more senior-level work.

MTW2 is my favorite though by far.

I'm not saying they're ALL like that but a fair amount are just guys with no "game".

There's enough digital distribution methods out there now to where these assholes only impede progress. I hope Trent and his team can figure out a way to get around this crap. They've worked hard and deserve the fruits of their labors.

A 25 man raid wasn't even remotely possible, regardless of talent and communication. Death also meant you lost your gear and experience, not just respawn as a ghost and run back.
I'm not saying these are bad things... just don't paint WoW out to be a hardcore MMO.

WoW has been the only MMO I flat out disliked. I actually enjoyed some of the mechanics in Warhammer online but they screwed it up by making the gameplay too much like WoW.

I'm not sure why you would think I'm repeating things I've read but it's simply not the case. You don't have any basis for that beyond me saying something about a game that you took personally. If you want to have an adult conversation let me know, until then I guess we're done.

I get burned out making no progression, beyond gear at the end game.

I think getting to level 35 in vanilla is a pretty good amount of time to invest to see if I'd like it or not. I guess I need you to refute some of my statements rather than just replying back "you're wrong" so I can better understand the points you are trying to make.
