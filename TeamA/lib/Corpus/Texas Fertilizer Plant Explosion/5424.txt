I'd probably agree with him.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (491)Breaking Down Why the James Harden Trade May Not Have Been a Terrible Deal  by  cattymillsin  nba[+]MelGibsonDerp 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago  (0 children)[–]MelGibsonDerp 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours agoI disagree. Durant and Westbrook aren't enough unless Ibaka significantly improves his game. They have very little bench and Perk is still their starting Center. In a really deep West and now a deep East for the first time in years they would have a rough road to the Finals.
Hypothetical: Thunder get 3rd seed. Play the Warriors/Rockets/Grizz/Clips/Spurs in the 1st round. Warriors/Rockets/Grizz/Clips/Spurs in the 2nd round. Warriors/Rockets/Grizz/Clips/Spurs in the Conference Finals.
Heat/Bulls/Pacers/Nets in the Finals.
There isn't a team there that OKC wouldn't have an easy series with. Getting out of the West is going to be hard enough and every single one of those matchups could yield a 7 game series.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (55)Is it possible that teams will intentionally try to shut down LeBron James to make other players beat them?  by  ziptnfin  nba[+]MelGibsonDerp 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago  (0 children)[–]MelGibsonDerp 1 point2 points3 points 21 hours ago
Last night when LeBron was on the floor, all the Hawks smothered him and prevented him from driving, shooting, and everything else.

First off, it's preseason. If you think he was trying his hardest you're wrong. Second, he said pregame that his legs "we're 80% and felt a little heavy" which caused his shot during the Red/White Scrimmage to be short. Guess what it caused during the Hawks game? Third, teams can try to intentionally shut him down but even with a great defense he'll likely end up with a 15/8/8 stat line which most players would gladly take.

Being the best player on 13 championship teams is an individual accomplishment. It's why players like Kobe and Lebron only care about rings.

First off it was 11, not 13.
Second, in Bill's last year the league had just expanded to the 13th and 14th teams. 8 teams made the playoffs. In Bill's first year the league had a total of 8 teams. 6 of which made the playoffs and only 3 of those teams finished above .500. The talent during his era was incredibly limited.
Lastly, look at the accomplishments posted above and compare them, then understand that LeBron is only 28. He'll be an all star at least 8 more times just because of his name (kind of how Kobe will be an all star starter this year even though he is hurt). He has a legitimate shot to be All NBA 1st team for 8 or more years same thing with All Defensive Team. Over the next 4-6 years he has a legitimate shot at the MVP.
If you give him the minimum that he could accomplish he'd end up with around 7 MVPS, 16 All star Games, 15 All NBA 1st teams, 13 All Defensive Teams by the time he is in his late 30's.

LeBron though I am not really stunned. Homerism aside we all know that LeBron has the greatest chance to challenge Jordan's GOAT status and we all know barring major injury he will probably surpass Kareem and Russell in individual accomplishments.

Anyone that thinks Kobe is the GOAT is just flat out wrong and completely uninformed on the subject of basketball. One of the greatest 2 guards ever, could make a case for top 10 player ever. GOAT? Not even close.

Good inside defense, 2 stars, 3 point shooting, and solid players to fill the gaps.
If Dwight is meh, they could probably get to the 2nd round but in a tough West I don't see them going farther than that with an average Dwight.
