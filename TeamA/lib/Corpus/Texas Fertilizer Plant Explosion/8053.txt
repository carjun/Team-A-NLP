|    E-mail|     PrintFive members of the group GetEqual Texas were arrested and charged with criminal trespassing after refusing to leave two Republican senators’ offices Wednesday.
The protesters were urging lawmakers to record a committee vote on Senate Bill 237, which would ban employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in Texas. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group sent about a dozen members from around the state to three conservative members’ offices of the Economic Development Committee, including chairman Sen. Bob Deuell, R-Greenville.

“This is only the beginning of actions to come,” said Michael Diviesti, state organizer for GetEqual Texas. “Each passing day there is more people that have the chance to be discriminated against. Our community cannot afford to wait two more years for next session.”
About 9 a.m., three members of the group entered Deuell’s office and chanted protests and urged a vote, staff members said. Dept. of Public Safety officers were notified but not asked to force the individuals to leave until about 9:45 a.m., when a criminal trespassing notice was issued, said Diviesti.
Upon refusal, three members of the LGBT group were arrested. Two other members protesting in Sen. Kelly Hancock’s office were subsequently arrested, DPS officials confirmed.
Diviesti said the group’s lawyer is at the Travis County jail discussing charges with officials. The DPS office confirmed the five individuals were charged with criminal trespassing, a Class B misdemeanors.
Don Forse, chief of staff for Deuell, said there is not a vote scheduled on the bill. He said members of the group delivered a flyer Friday “threatening” a “non-violent” protest and sit-in today if the committee did not vote on the bill this week.
The bill is authored by San Antonio Democrat Sen. Leticia Van de Putte.
The group began a social media campaign more than two weeks ago and banners targeting Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, were dropped over bridges on I-35 last week, Diviesti said.
C.D. Kirven from Dallas, Koby Ozias from Corpus Christi, Jennifer Falcon from San Antonio and Tiffani Bishop from Austin were among those arrested, Diviesti said.
