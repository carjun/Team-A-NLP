(c) 2013 vintage synthesizer demo track by RetroSound"SuperMoto" bass, lead, drum, sequencer and fx sounds: Moog Minimoog with Lintronics Midipads, strings: Roland Juno-60motorcycle engine: Suzuki DR-Z 400 SMrecording multi-trackfx: reverb and delayThe Lintronics MIDI Converter ("LMC") is a feature-rich, high-performance MIDI interface that is designed specifically to place the expressive potential of the Minimoog and certain other monophonic analog synthesizers under MIDI control. Designed by Rudi Linhard (who also designed the Lintronics Advanced Memorymoog Modification), the LMC uses state-of-the-art digital circuitry and software. It includes an internal Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO), which can be used in addition to, or in place of the host synth's LFO. Pitch, pitch bend, filter cutoff, loudness, modulation amount, and the internal LFO's (Low Frequency Oscillator) rate and depth, all may be controlled through MIDI in real time and with high resolution. In addition, the Glide and Decay functions may be turned on and off through MIDI. A wide range of controller assignments, keyboard modes, and similar options are accessed through MIDI Program Change commands. And the LMC includes a programmable wide range multiwaveform LFO which can be used in addition to or in place of the host synth's LFO.
