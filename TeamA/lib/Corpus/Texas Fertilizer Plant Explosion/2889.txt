MJD's production has been on a steady decline.
Gio tries hard and Fred is a tank.

If you are looking for something closer, Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center

I'm benching him until after his bye because, well, KC SF, and SEA. If he doesn't shape up by week 12, he is getting package traded.

It's a high risk. I keep going back and forth. What worries me is this:

Vick had both of his ankles rolled up on during the play, and looked to be in some pain while walking to the sidelines. Even if the injury is a concern moving forward, Vick does have nine days to heal and prepare for Week 4 against the Broncos. by Chris Towers | CBSSports.com

Would I trade Vick for Pryor? No. If he is on the wavier, I would rather drop somebody and pick him up for the week.

Bowe Vs DAL
Cook Vs ATL
Cameron Vs BAL
Johnson Vs CAR
Brown Bs CLE
I'm not trusting Bowe that well against DAL at the moment. Right now I'm feeling:
Flex: Bowe vs DAL
WR1: Johnson Vs CLE
WR2: Williams Vs NO
What are your thoughts?
