Economics isn't all that complicated. We can create a million new American jobs this year by simply looking for the Made In America label. If each of us takes a tiny fraction of the money we're already spending and buys US-made goods, we'll create a economic tidal wave. Watch the video, and then share it with at least two people. Boom, you just helped make a million new jobs. Learn more and take the pledge at:http://millionjobsproject.us/
