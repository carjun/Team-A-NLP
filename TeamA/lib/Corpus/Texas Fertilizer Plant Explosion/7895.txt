Community Guidelines:

Flair should show your qualifications or your involvement in art if any eg. [Oil painter]
Work in progress must be posted in this thread: Here
If you need help identifying a piece of work post it here: Here

Submissions:

Titles for individual pieces of work must be titled 'Title, medium, size' or 'Title, Artist, Year', if you do not know a segment leave it blank. If looking for feedback add [C&C].
When posting an album, title it '[Album]Album Name'. Do not make multiple posts instead of an album.
Articles should be posted with the title, 'Article title, Year of publishment'.
Do not add context to the title, that should be reserved for the comments, we don't need to know it your first time using a medium in the title.
Please credit the artist and provide a link to their site in the comments if possible.
No memes or Reddit references eg. 'Cakeday', Absolutely no crayon 'Art'.
No request for tattoos or free artwork.
Links to pages selling work should be submitted to a different sub-reddit such as /r/artstore.
The mods reserve the right to remove submissions that aren't of a high quality, this is both in the quality of the submission and quality of the photograph. /r/IDAP may be a more suitable subreddit.

Comments:

Don't leave comments like 'That's great!' Just upvote instead.
Negative comments must be made constructively.
Upvote comments that leave honest constructive criticism (even if it's negative criticism).
