In that case turning off the servers wouldn't itself cause any (full) loss of data.
As far as I know the game doesn't try to save your progress locally so the worst that would happen would be one lost play session while they update. And if they correctly implemented some kind of graceful countdown-to-shutdown logic on the client-side (which I have no confidence they have done considering the current state of online, but which I have seen in other titles such as Planetside 2) the data for current play-sessions could even be saved before the servers go down.

It can't be worse than what's happening now, assuming that hitting retry really does wipe character data. It's definitely worth shutting the servers down for an hour or two to even potentially fix that.

Just stat-tracking, same as CoD.

Is it not both? And what exactly is the difference?

But people are having their characters become corrupted (thus losing potentially hours of progress). Not to mention that most of the time when their servers are down the game just hangs, with no error message or option to back out. That's sloppy design. 
Of course, luckily the single player was easily worth the $60 by itself.

Isn't that what a map is? I.e. online maps are indeed maps, just with extra data visualization layered above them?

It definitely isn't clear what happened based on the article, I'm just commenting on a hypothetical. If they were shooting into nets or if the other kids expected and didn't mind being shot then they shouldn't get punished.

Those things hurt, and can do some real damage if you get shot in the eye etc. They definitely aren't nerf guns.
EDIT: Just to parrot the current top comment:

You all seriously need to read the letter from the school.  Emphasis mine.

In the course of the investigation, conducted in concert with a police officer and the school division Office of 
Safety and Loss Control, we identified the children who were firing pellet guns at each other and at people near 
the bus stop. Several students verified that they had been hit by pellets and had the marks to support their 
claims. In one instance, a child was only 10 feet from the bus stop and ran from the shots being fired but was 
still hit. Another student claimed to be shot in the back while running away during a previous incident 
Wednesday, Sept. 11. This child was also shot in the arm and head during Thursday’s incident. I contacted the 
school division’s Office of Student Leadership and School Board Legal Counsel for guidance. Because 
students were on their way to or at a school bus stop when they were struck by pellets, the school division has 
jurisdiction to take disciplinary actions against those students responsible for the disruption. There is an 
expectation that all students should be able to travel to and from school in the safest environment possible.


Now I definitely think some harsh punishment was warranted.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (22)GTA V has been out for a week now, what does everyone think?  by  Schwarzengermanin  Games[+]throwSv 8 points9 points10 points 13 days ago  (0 children)[–]throwSv 8 points9 points10 points 13 days agoI don't think it's an automatic trigger. I think you only get the wanted level if a soldier actually sees you. (I've gotten pretty far into the base without getting wanted and also saw a video on YouTube where a guy parachutes into the center of the base somehow without being seen or triggering a wanted level.)
Still, you're right that the stealth aspect at least for the fort is underdeveloped, as it seems pretty random whether someone will see you or not.

And anyway pretty much any modern game lets you turn the graphics as high as you want until eventually your video card becomes the bottleneck; however, rarely does a game let you turn up an option that primarily impacts CPU (advanced physics could be one such option but that's often done on the GPU too if it doesn't affect gameplay).

Even if he had a faster GPU, more memory, etc. etc., it wouldn't improve his framerate since his CPU is what is holding him back (which is unusual for games--GPU is usually the bottleneck).

permalinksavecontextfull comments (230)Gamespot discusses fans' negative reaction to GTA V's 9/10 score and criticism that the game is misogynistic.  by  thepulloutmethodin  gamernews[+]throwSv 3 points4 points5 points 16 days ago  (0 children)[–]throwSv 3 points4 points5 points 16 days agoI can definitely find aspects that could have been improved upon, such as: missions are generally very linear (including the heists); as mentioned the shooting while driving is terrible; I don't personally like the radio as much as I did past GTA games; I also somewhat agree that female characters could have been developed with more depth--not out of any political convictions but just because I think it would have made the game more interesting; and [SPOILER AHEAD] you are given a certain choice near the end of the game and although most people will choose a certain ("right") way, the choice itself is totally unnecessary and detracts from the narrative IMO (especially if you choose "wrong").
The thing is, the game is so far ahead of any other game in so many other ways that it's hard to justify giving GTAV less than a 10.0 if you have previously given any other game a 10.0.

They haven't really said why they are waiting two weeks but my guess is they need a little extra time to polish it, and also they might be hoping that by waiting, they won't have a launch-day rush which would overwhelm their servers. I wouldn't be surprised to see them actually stagger the release over the whole day for that same reason.
