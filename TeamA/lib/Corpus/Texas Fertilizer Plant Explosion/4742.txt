LAND OF GIANTS ON FACEBOOKhttp://www.facebook.com/landofgiantsfilmThis short is a first look into the world of LAND OF GIANTS, where western, martial arts and giant creatures meet in a post-apocalyptic future.After an apocalyptic storm reduced the world to ruins, Giants appeared, to punish those who would ever again lay their hands on the magic called "Electricity".A long time ago Crutch (Mathis Landwehr) challenged the Gigants anger. His destroyed knee won't let him forget the day, they took everything from him.So he ventured out to hunt and kill them...We made this short to promote the idea of LAND OF GIANTS as a TV-Series, and are working hard right now, so this dream can become a reality.If you would like to see more of LAND OF GIANTS and want to help us getting it made, join our page on Facebook! There we'll keep you updated on our process and will offer insights into our development process.Music by http://www.stullenheimer.de/DIRECTOR'S CHANNELhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Topper2001PRODUCER'S CHANNELhttp://www.youtube.com/user/mathislan...HOMEPAGEhttp://www.land-of-giants.com/----------------------------------------­---- Sign up to receive updates, offers, and information from Machinima. http://bit.ly/MachinimaNewsletter FOR MORE INSIDE GAMING, GO TO: http://www.youtube.com/user/InSideGaming WANT TO JOIN THE MACHINIMA AFFILIATE PROGRAM?
