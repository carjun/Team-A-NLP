permalinksavecontextfull comments (1126)[Spoiler] Fnatic vs Cloud 9 / Post-Match Discussion Thread / Quarter Finals  by  ajsadlerin  leagueoflegends[+]chiggmo 2 points3 points4 points 7 days ago  (0 children)[–]chiggmo 2 points3 points4 points 7 days agoI could care less, You may as well call it american teams not NA, there's no Canadians. Been rooting for Fnatic since the start, and hope they win it all.
I don't like any of the NA teams personally, at all, nothing about any of them is impressive to me, the only one that did stand a chance though was C9.
The fact that the always underperforming TSM, and game throwing Vulcan made it as #2 and #3 says enough about NA being behind every other region.
Get some Canadian teams/players in there and I hold some reason to hold bias for NA teams, till then I have no reason to give a shit about "NA" teams winning or losing :P

But yes you are right. But the huge gap in early game trades works so well for him that you should be able to zone her right out of the lane and force jungle pressure. Comes down to supports imo. My standard build for Lucian goes
Bt, cleaver/lw, tri force, IE, cleaver/lw, ga or zehpyr depending if i feel i need the ga or not

permalinksavecontextfull comments (8)Support Mentality: The Pick  by  LambentEyesin  leagueoflegends[+]chiggmo 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago  (0 children)[–]chiggmo 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoThe thing that puts him ahead of graves is;
A) his passive. Which is a steroid of its own. Late game with crit does some massive damage of its own.
B) Short cooldowns combined with said passive will pit out a lot.of damage. With blue buff even more so. Get him 40% cdr and his damage will just roll in.
C) vayne i agree is better. But if you lane lucian vs vayne, at least in my experience. Youll get fed with ease in lane and completely zone her and she will never make it to hyper carry.
D) snowball's so incredibly hard if you get him slightly ahead due to really strong laneing.
Im not really trying to argue the hyper carry title for him. But he's damn close to it.
A lot of peoples problem on him is terrible build thinking attack speed is useful.on him when its not. Same for Bork, its bad early item for him. But that's just my opinion.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (178)Support Mentality: The Pick  by  LambentEyesin  leagueoflegends[+]chiggmo 0 points1 point2 points 15 days ago  (0 children)[–]chiggmo 0 points1 point2 points 15 days agoIts a lot easier for him to get fed I find, he trades super hard. He can do ridiculous burst to anyone on very short cooldowns. I've carried countless games with him.
He also scales incredibly good with AD lol, I don't know where you're getting that from. He'll also slaughter a vayne in lane, and go on to out carry her with ease...
Get him to a 3 item build of BT, LW/Cleaver (take your pick) and Tri force. As long as you aren't behind everyone else getting there, you'll obliterate anyone you want. Throw an IE in after that, and just go to town.
Also anyone who says build a bork or any real form of attack speed on him is full of shit, it's terrible.

I have no problem with his ult at all, gotta learn how to use it. And you probably build him terribly. His ult can 100-0 any squishy with the passive after it.

He's def a hyper carry. And trades VERY well in lane. Only sucks if you fall behind.

But he's basing his math off of him already having completed this 7TD game
