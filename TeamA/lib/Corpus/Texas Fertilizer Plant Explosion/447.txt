I remember transforming my computer from a DOS-based machine to a Windows 95 one.  It came on (what felt like) 20 diskettes (always resented these being called floppies) and changed the way the world used PCs.  
It opened the door for a company like America Online to sweep in and push millions of people online for free trials and... Well, look at us now!

It's tasty, but extremely fattening... and considering the weird reputation it's earned as "being good for you", well - stuff like this happens.
Looks damn tasty though... but you ate the whole thing alone, didn't you :(

permalinksavecontextfull comments (64)What I've always wanted from video game consoles...  by  sweetnombrein  gaming[+]Lovelocke64 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago  (0 children)[–]Lovelocke64 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoDigital Distribution may be the only way games are released in the future.  The PC Games section at Fry's Electronics has been reduced to a single half-aisle... brings a tear to the eye.
That said, I'm still a fan of the physical copy.  If you want to revitalize interest in physical media, you should set out to design game box art that requires its own display, not something that fits uniformly alongside rows and rows of green (or blue, whatever) edged DVD cases.
Remember the box for Earthbound?  Tomb Raider?  Large, stuffed with goodies... posters, maps, guidebooks, etc.  When I preordered Ocarina of Time I got temporary tattoos, a holographic gold cover art replica, gold colored game cart and a poster.  It was amazing stuff.  Seeing the large poster in GTA V was a great throwback to those days.

He is THE reason porn has quietly changed from fuzzy visuals with crap music to what it is today... women gagging on cock, being trained to like it, and a greater focus on male pleasure.
Facial Abuse, Ghetto Gaggers, Young Throats, etc.  Dozens of sites, genesis from ONE artist.
Here is a great website, showcasing the videos that were shown to the jury that convicted him in court.  WHY couldn't I get JURY DUTY on THAT day!?

permalinksavecontextfull comments (88)Steam Controller button layout  by  Gangxxterin  Steam[+]Lovelocke64 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago  (0 children)[–]Lovelocke64 0 points1 point2 points 8 days agoI see this as the start of a great controller, but right now it's squarely in "good idea" territory.  SMALL "secondary" buttons seem sweet, placement wise, but are about as practical as the Nintendo 64's L-Trigger.
Remember all the times you used that?
