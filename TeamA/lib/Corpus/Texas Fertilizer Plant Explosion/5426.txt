Dear everyone,






We’d like to thank everyone who’s been buying gold or gilding comments, and thought we’d share some interesting stats on where some of that gold goes.  The following are some stats we pulled on gilding activity over the past 6 months:

Secret pro-tip in the middle of this post - you can see a feed of all gilded comments here!  But back to...

Another postcard gem. 
Note: Asking for gold is rarely the best way to get it.

More trivia: the most total gilding done by a single user over the past 6 months is 144 months of gold (that’s 5.6 gilds per week, so we’re pretty impressed), followed by 120 months for second place.  We’d tell you who they are, but unless otherwise notified, we assume that such beneficent benefactors desire to remain anonymous.

And as an ongoing thanks for your support of reddit, we have three new gold benefits to announce:



Homejoy - cleaning your place.  Four months of discounted cleaning at $15/hour up to 20 hours/month with no charge for cleaning supplies.
