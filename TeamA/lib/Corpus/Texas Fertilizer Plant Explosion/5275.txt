permalinksavecontextfull comments (690)AK queues still taking 1+ hour  by  eotein  ffxiv[+]muchogusto- 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago* (0 children)[–]muchogusto- 0 points1 point2 points 14 days ago*Let's be real here, the % of the playerbase that is at the 'Farming AK' status is 5pct at tops. Don't act like they are purposefully slighting their entire playerbase because a single 50 dungeon has had a bugged q for a couple of days. The sky is falling.
Games are built from the bottom up, not the top down. If everybody who thinks this game is ruined because they havent been able to spam AK leaves and quits, the game would probably have a much nicer community.
