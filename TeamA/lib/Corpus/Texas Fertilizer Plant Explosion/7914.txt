permalinksavecontextfull comments (80)First ride today - Wow, more difficult than I thought it'd be!  by  civelkaosin  bicycling[+]gorillagnomes 1 point2 points3 points 14 hours ago  (0 children)[–]gorillagnomes 1 point2 points3 points 14 hours agoSome advice for shifting: gear down (the easiest setting of both shifters) as low as you can and ride that way for awhile. If you're riding flat, gear up a bit at a time until you feel it's almost difficult. Go back down in gear. Go back up until it's comfortable and consistent.
Riding hills? Keep it in the granny gears until you feel like you're spinning like woah (your legs are having to go waaaaay faster than is comfortable), then gear up one at a time.
The front derailleur will make you go faster, but with more effort. The rear will make you go a little bit faster with less effort. 
Also, a note about gearing: when you're climbing, it's less stress on your components to go up in gear than down. Start off at the bottom of the hill in your easiest gears and then gear up appropriately. 
I ride bikes for a living, but racers and cross riders might have stronger advice than I.

With that said, the Starbucks Macchiato is a bastardized drink.
