HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2013-- 
  Following the deadly fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, Aetna (NYSE: AET) has opened its employee assistance program lines for any person who may be having difficulty coping with the explosion and its aftermath. Aetna also is making it easier for members affected by the explosion to refill prescriptions and find care outside their home areas for those who have evacuated. The company is extending claim and appeal filing times, among other steps. 

  "Our deepest sympathies and concerns are with the people of West, Texas, following this terrible event," said Aetna Chairman, CEO and President Mark T. Bertolini. "Aetna is already at work helping those affected get the help they need to move forward from this disaster." 

  The Aetna Behavioral Health Employee Assistance Program professionals who will answer the phone have experience helping people through traumatic events, and are available now. Any person, regardless of insurance, is welcome to contact Aetna's counselors for help, support or referrals for further assistance. 

  The number to call is 1-888-AETNA-EAP (1-888-238-6232). Individuals and families also may want to reference the following materials. 

   -- Recovering from trauma and loss 
 
   -- Recognizing and coping with sadness after a loss 
  In addition, Aetna members and health care providers affected by the disaster who need care or other assistance can reach the company at the following toll-free numbers. 

   -- Aetna Member Services: Call the number printed on your ID card*. If ID 
      card is unavailable, call 1-800-443-AETNA (1-800-443-2386)

  Affected Aetna members may refill their prescriptions early, as needed. Those who use Aetna's mail-order pharmacy can receive a prescription at an alternate delivery location or refill a prescription that may have been lost, damaged or destroyed. 

  Affected Aetna members also can seek emergency care anywhere, as needed. As part of its disaster procedures, Aetna will monitor the impact on its network doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. The company will work closely with providers to make further modifications to its policies as necessary to ensure members have access to care. 

  If any additional local, state or federal disaster executive orders or regulations are issued related to these catastrophic events, Aetna will adjust its policies to comply.
