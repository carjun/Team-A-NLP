Poll: Do you support the striking doctors?
THE COUNTRY’S JUNIOR doctors began their one day strike at 7am after efforts to resolve their dispute with the HSE failed.
More than 12,000 out-patient consultant appointments and 3,000 elective surgeries are cancelled. However, emergency departments are open.
The doctors want an end to 24 hour shifts, as set out under EU law, and a reduction of their working week to 48 hours.
Today we ask: Do you support the Irish Medical Organisation’s action?
Poll Results:Yes. They were left with no other option.No. They should try again to settle it through talks.I don't have an opinion either way.Vote
