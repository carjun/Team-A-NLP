 Everybody is welcome on this subreddit. Feel free to post any kind of submission.
You don't need to be the proud owner of a top-of-the-line gaming pc to be a member of the master race.
If your post doesn't show up immediately it might have been caught by the spam bot. Please do not delete your submission, but message the mod team instead.
Join our official glorious PC MASTER RACE Steam Group.
Please follow reddiquette. No one will be banned for silly reasons nor do I plan to limit content in anyway, as long as it's more or less relevant to the subreddit.
Please do not link directly to threads in other subreddits. If you happen to follow a thread to another subreddit and vote or comment on something, and the reddit admins judge that to be vote brigading, you can get a site-wide ban. If you happen to find a link here to another subreddit, DO NOT VOTE OR COMMENT ON IT.
The Master Race is generous. When we do giveaways we do it within the bounds of /r/pcmasterrace. Feel free to give the games as you see fit, but refrain from demanding subscribes and comments on your youtube channel and whatnot. You can post about your channel, just don't make it a requirement to subscribe or comment there to get prizes. We prefer image screenshots of keys.
