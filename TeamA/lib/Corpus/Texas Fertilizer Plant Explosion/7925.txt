The only reason I can think of is that our name is Baylor and their names are UCLA, Oklahoma, Washington, etc.

I don't care how emotionally charged the situation was, that's not the way you should represent yourself or Baylor football.

I was really impressed with Allen last season.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (3)Reddit, what's your favorite class.  by  130nard0in  blackops2[+]NawtAGoodNinja 0 points1 point2 points 3 days ago  (0 children)[–]NawtAGoodNinja 0 points1 point2 points 3 days agoI'm a little late to the party on this one, but here's my three favorite classes (in no particular order).  I usually switch between these three at random, depending on how I'm doing in the game.  
Note: I play almost exclusively hardcore, so if any of these classes catches your eye, you may have to modify them slightly for core game modes.

First, I have my basic assault class.  This is my well rounded class, it's good for pretty much any play style in any game mode.  I switch the sight out a lot, usually rotating between Target Finder, MMS, and Hybrid Sight (whichever one I fancy at the time, really). 
Next, there's my run'n'gun class.  This is the class I use when I want to go crazy.  Really good for hit and run play, fast movement and stealth.  You can easily have a crazy high K/D with this class.
Finally, there's my machine gunner class.  I'll admit, I'm a massive bitch with this class.  I sit behind my claymore and a trophy system and just pick people off.  Adding the dual-band/variable zoom combo makes it almost an automatic sniper.  Great for holding down a position, especially if you have someone to watch your back.

I'm interested to see how the rankings have changed since some major losses have occurred.  by  PYRoBUin  baylor[+]NawtAGoodNinja 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago  (0 children)[–]NawtAGoodNinja 0 points1 point2 points 5 days agoAgreed. Any position of those four teams could be argued, but they're all at the top. Baylor, Oklahoma State, OU, and (surprisingly) Texas Tech. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (3)Alright, I know no one wants this question asked, but I feel like it has to be: what's Briles doing when Mack Brown gets fired?  by  Rynylin  baylor[+]NawtAGoodNinja 6 points7 points8 points 5 days ago  (0 children)[–]NawtAGoodNinja 6 points7 points8 points 5 days agoBriles is ridiculously loyal to Baylor.  I think the only thing that would pull him away from his contract extension here is a metric shit-ton of money.  Much more money than UT could offer.  Briles has the chance to be a Joe Paterno-style dynasty leader here (except for, y'know, the child molestation thing).

Only way you're getting a cross map hit is on Nuketown, and then you're still close enough for them to know exactly where you are.
