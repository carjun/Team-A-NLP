permalinksave[+]ForTheLoveOfTree[S] 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago  (3 children)[–]ForTheLoveOfTree[S] 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoShe is looking at accounting firms in large cities, and I work in the gas line business, which is in every large city also. Just want to find a nice suburban area near one.

permalinksaveparent[+]morganational 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours ago  (1 child)[–]morganational 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours agoI think Houston would be best for both of your jobs, and has plenty of nice suburban areas. Also check out Austin, but jobs are harder to get there. Best of luck to you.

permalinksaveparent[+]duuuuumb 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours ago  (1 child)[–]duuuuumb 0 points1 point2 points 10 hours agoI can tell you that 2nd ward in Houston is the place to live right now. I've lived here since 1992, back when this was the barrio. Now it's half that and an up and coming neighborhood. Lots of young people, cheap rent, cool bars and restaurants popping up everywhere, and the best tacos in town.

permalinksave[+]OscarTheBorracho 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours ago  (0 children)[–]OscarTheBorracho 0 points1 point2 points 6 hours agoYeah, that place has really been up and coming over the last few years. Building the Dynamo stadium helped a lot.
