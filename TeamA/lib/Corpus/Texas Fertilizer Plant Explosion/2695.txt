Hello guys,here goes another amv of mine ;). I can't believe, I haven't made a Konan amv yet, I mean till now, lol. I love this girly so damn much. And I find this song extremely fitting but what's more, I totally adore it. Was on Capital Cities' concert during Selector, they rocked so hard!Ah, and that "I stole your diamonds and gold", I'm pretty sure it must have some different meaning. Like stealing the love or something, goddamn I hate too straightforward lyrics, therefore looking for another meaning :P.Couldn't have made the video longer for one obvious reason - anime lacks Konan footage -.- And well, it turned a bit into Yahiko x Konan but I'm quite sure, you won't mind it. He was awesome ;D.I missed oldschool editing, I'm sick of those overlays everywhere. Enjoyed making this video and hope you will like it guys!Song: Origami by Capital CitiesPrograms used: Sony Vegas Pro 11 and a bit of Adobe After EffectsTime taken: lol dunno, about 10 hours in total, I guess
