The road into the site is still closed and will remain so for the foreseeable future.  Wednesday's massive explosion could be felt 50 miles away. Authorities have estimated that more than 50 homes have been destroyed and 200 people injured.  On Friday crews were still searching for survivors. Authorities said they've recovered 14 bodies, a majority of them volunteer firefighters and emergency medical workers.
