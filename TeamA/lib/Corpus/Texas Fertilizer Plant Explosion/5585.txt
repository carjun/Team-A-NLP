However, on defense we tend to rely on our starters until they can't go.
I think Baylor is getting to the Oregon level but we don't have the depth your team has on offense or defense. 
Hope DAT gets healthy soon!

Respectable schools don't take players surrounded in controversy

Cam Newton?
If saying Baylor isn't a respectful school, then that is your opinion. 
Just as my opinion is that Tech is the least respectful school in the Big 12. The horror stories you hear from opposing fans visiting Jones Stadium makes me appreciate the Baylor vs. TT game being in Dallas.

You failed to answer what legal law Lache broke BEFORE he even attended Baylor.

EDIT:
LOL, you used Lache as an example. Remind me  of what law he broke?
Also, Mike Orakpo never made it to Baylor.
Stonum did have previous off the field issues but was never really a contributor on the field at Baylor and never got into any more trouble.

Unfortunately, many inmates choose to misbehave in jail which causes them to loose the opportunity to participate in those programs.

I am pretty sure I have seen high school teams with better offenses. I just don't think offenses are competent enough to score that many points.

First road game and Bill Snyder is a good coach. 
Maybe Texas Tech but I don't think we should be "expected to win". That game is always a toss up.

I go to Baylor and he didn't say that. You are spewing bullshit and stirring trouble. At least check your facts before talking out of your ass.
He said "I think Baylor just won its first Heisman". He said the entire season the Heisman was a team award, not his, and that he couldn't have won it without his team. He referred to his team winning the Heisman with a big win over Texas to finish the season. He never referred to himself.
