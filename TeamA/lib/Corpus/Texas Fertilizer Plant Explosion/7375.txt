"Synthpop's Alive! Can't you hear it?!"Disclaimer: This video response is in no way intended as a personal attack against the maker of the original "Synthpop is Dead" video. On the contrary, I found that video very amusing -- even if I disagree with its central message. As for whose case my own effort ends up supporting, well... I'll let you be the judge of that!-------------Synthpop's AliveEveryone's entitled to opinionYou have yours and well, I have mineAnd though it seems that our opinions differYou'll agree in timeWell, I don't know what's written in the papersI never listen to the radioHaven't been out dancing now for agesIn case you didn't knowI've been staying at homeDancing aloneLiving in a dream since 1983Dear me!Well, I don't care what people think about meThough you know sometimes the truth can hurtBut I will stand my ground 'till I'm pushing daisiesUp through the dirtI've been staying at homeDancing aloneLiving in a dream since 1983That's me!(Phone rings)"Hey, it's me. Listen, I hate to tell you but...Synthpop is dead."What? What are you talking about? No way! Never!Synthpop's alive!Can't you hear it?Synthpop's alive!Can't you hear it?Well, if you can't, it doesn't matter to meThe beat goes on, that's plain enough to seeSynthpop's alive... for me.Words and Music by Clark StiefelCopyright 2008 Clark Stiefel / Maison Vague
