permalinksavecontextfull comments (1092)Gov. Christie signs law easing medical marijuana restrictions for N.J. kids: "Parents, not government regulators, are best suited to decide how to care for their children, and this law advances that important principle”  by  DougBolivarin  trees[+]haiduz -1 points0 points1 point 21 days ago  (0 children)[–]haiduz -1 points0 points1 point 21 days agoThen we could finally put an end to vaccinations and government mandated hospitalizations for dying children, when natural cures will surely do the trick!
The point is everyone agrees that parents should be in charge of kids healthcare when it lends to the argument of recreational marijuana use. You guys will literally agree with everything that supports it.  However, Christies argument is not a universal truth because some parents are not sane enough to make healthcare decisions for their kids. That's when government needs to step in and help those kids from their patents.
