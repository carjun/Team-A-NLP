Legendary Queen guitarist Brian May and West End and Broadway songstress Kerry Ellis have re-recorded the the Oscar-winning song 'Born Free'. The classic hit single will be sold in aid of international wildlife charity, the Born Free Foundation, full details here http://www.bornfree.org.uk/bfsingle'Born Free' was first recorded by Matt Monro in 1966 as the title song to the classic wildlife film of the same name, starring Virginia McKenna OBE and the late Bill Travers, which told the story of George and Joy Adamson's successful release of Elsa, an orphaned lioness, to the wild. Inspired by their experiences in Kenya, Virginia and Bill went on to establish the Born Free Foundation. The release of the single ties in with Brian and Kerry performing a series of intimate UK concert tour dates, also in support of the Born Free Foundation. The single is accompanied by a powerful promotional video focussing on the plight of lions, filmed in South Africa by the award-winning director Mike Slee (Flight of the Butterflies, 2012) and featuring Virginia McKenna.
