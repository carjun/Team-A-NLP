Many people trapped under debris and with the fire going on, it's slowing down the pace for rescuing folks. You could feel the vibration hit as far as from Dallas (70 miles away) once it imploded. But I plan on donating and aiding tomorrow. Not much info being released now as there's tons of firemen ceasing the blaze.

They have EMS and Firefighters coming from miles away and do not need help. Just so you know. I'll find the video to make sure.
@40 seconds he says "We do not need help." This is just so you do not waste your time :)

Camp grounds and Hotels are opening their doors, lots of places are setting up donations centers. There's still lots to do, there's just nothing we can do in West right now and we need to focus elsewhere where volunteers can be accommodated.

I have the utmost respect for those who do so. I'm not a man of faith, but I give respect to those who cannot donate and send their thoughts, love, and prayers. Such a tragedy for Waco the surrounding areas.

imploded

It exploded. Be careful not to use too many "cool sounding words". Shit doesnt "implode" That's almost just a theoretical thing.
It was most definitely an explosion

However, the factory did most certainly explode.  If it "goes out" it exploded, if it "goes in" it imploded...

permalinksaveparent[+]JoelFromBookkeeping 0 points1 point2 points 6 months ago  (2 children)[–]JoelFromBookkeeping 0 points1 point2 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onLook, I'll teach you some basic social skills. For one, there's a difference between correcting someone and being a dick. You accused him of posturing and then said "shit doesn't implode". Instead, you should have said "This is a common mix up, but this building exploded. An easy way to remember is that when it is outward, it's explosion and when it's inward, it's implosion."
In response to me, insulting me isn't going to help your case. Instead you should have said "In my original post, it may have sounded like I was being hostile, but I was just trying to correct him in the best way possible. Sorry you feel that way."
So there you have it, Wilcows.

Can they just wait out this huge fire that could possible cause a huge explosion? Or do they have to go try to put it out no matter what?

permalinksaveparent[+]BetterThanBathSalts 1 point2 points3 points 6 months ago  (1 child)[–]BetterThanBathSalts 1 point2 points3 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onVolunteer firefighter here. I also have my Haz-Mat certification. A small department like this most likely responds with 2-3 vehicles and as many personel that can make the page before the barn is empty. The ERG, a national guidebook, provides a list of advisory and mandatory evacuation areas for almost EVERY manufactured chemical in the USA. Most small departments always, and should, understand the local dangers they have around them. I.E. Chemical/fertilizer plants, nuclear plants, and even common places hotels and multi room, high casualty businesses. To answer your question though, no. These FF most likely disregarded the majority of their volunteer safety training, NFPA standards, and ERG guidelines in order to help those in danger. Whether it was the possibility of stopping the further death of residents in this town (by explosion), or helping those trapped at this plant, these men gave their lives to serve others. I could give you the general "great person/hero" sob story, but I'd rather leave us with the creed every FF takes, volunteer or career, "I shall sell my life dearly to my enemy fire but give 
it freely to rescue those in peril." I hope that helps, and I'll be watching the news all night. Feel free to ask more questions if I can help.

This town has a population of about 2k and is a pretty large size for a rural area. Considering it hasn't rained enough to lower the chances of it spreading, they are working to put it out as quickly before anyone else is injured. There's also another tank that might blow in the same area.
