A large explosion rocked a small community near Waco, Texas, Wednesday night, triggering a raging fire and dozens of injuries. 

The Waco Tribune reported that several firefighters were hurt after a fertilizer plant exploded in the town of West, Texas.
Glenn Robinson, chief executive of Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco, told CNN that about 40 people had been brought to the hospital with injuries, some serious.
Officials were setting up a trauma center at the West Community Center. 
Gov. Rick Perry put out the following statement: “We are monitoring developments and gathering information as details continue to emerge about this incident. We have also mobilized state resources to help local authorities. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of West, and the first responders on the scene.”
Local reporters and witnesses in the area were tweeting about the blast:

                Korona, like you I was thinking of the Texas City event.  It does continue to beg the question...what kind of zoning laws allow a nursing home, 2 schools, a hospital & residences to be that close to a chemical plant?Saying prayers for all. GOD BLESS TEXAS.

                Almost the exact day, April 16, 1947. Texas city, TX. The ship Grandcamp, in the port of Texas City, exploded while filled with burning fertilizer. Ammonium Nitrate, the same material used in 1995 in Oklahoma City. Sad to think the firefighters in West, TX may have forgotten the lessons learned 66 years and one day, ago.
