            Device's official music video for "You Think You Know". Download Device's self-titled debut album here- http://smarturl.it/deviceit...Video Directed by P.R. BrownFor more information visit http://deviceband.com.Facebook- http://on.fb.me/SzhNhaTwitter- http://bit.ly/WLpbWGSoundcloud- http://bit.ly/Vhbct6iTunes - http://smarturl.it/deviceit...David Draiman of Disturbed, and ex-Filter guitarist Geno Lenardo recently collaborated together to construct Device. The album takes strands from hard rock, industrial, and electronica, and as a result, Device's self-titled debut album for Warner Bros. Records is a focused, fierce, and fiery new machine. It all started while the Grammy Award-nominated multiplatinum powerhouse Disturbed was on hiatus, Lenardo reached out to Draiman to collaborate on a song for the Underworld: Awakening soundtrack in late 2011. As soon as the singer heard the music, he was both intrigued and inspired. The duo then cut "Hunted" in Chicago. Even though the track didn't ultimately make the final soundtrack album due to circumstances beyond their control, Draiman urged that they hold on to it and continue writing music. Soon, they had an entire album's worth of material. Upon finishing the record, Draiman enlisted Evanescence drummer Will Hunt and Dope and Rock of Ages guitarist Virus. Both Hunt and Virus jumped at the chance to be a part of this powerhouse trio. The three comprise the touring incarnation of Device.
