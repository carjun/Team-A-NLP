There are two types of self-serve ads, "frontpage" and "targeted".
When you submit an "frontpage" ad, your ad will run on (you guessed it) the front page. You tell us when you want it to run, and how much you want to pay in total over that time period.  Front page ads will also rotate with reddit house ads, and links from the "new" queue of organic user-submitted posts.
When you choose to target, your ad will show up in two sections:

1) Top spot on the subreddit being targeted.  If there is more than one person (or more than one ad) targeted to that subreddit on the same day, your ad will rotate with those ads as well. Delivery is spread evenly throughout the day.
2) On the front page of a user who is logged in and subscribes to that subreddit. This will rotate with other ads that are targeted to other subreddits that user is subscribed to, along with front page ads.

How much does it cost?
Self-serve ads are on a CPM platform. This means that you are charged a flat fee for every 1,000 impressions you want to receive. Our CPM rate is $0.75, so 75 cents per 1,000 times your ad gets "delivered" (displayed to a redditor). The front page, along with each subreddit has a different amount of impressions it's able to deliver. This is known as "inventory". The larger subreddits have more inventory than the smaller subreddits, because they have more traffic and more importantly, more pageviews. If you want to advertise during a period of time when all the inventory has been sold, you'll need to choose a different time period, lower your budget, or choose a different subreddit.
The minimum spend per campaign is $5, and the maximum per campaign is $9,999.
Creating a promotion
How do I create a promotion?
Visit this link to begin building your ad. You'll need:

Some copy for a headline
A functional URL
Optional 70x70 thumbnail

Why do I have to validate my email address?
All correspondence about the status of your sponsored link is handled via email. Since your dollars involved, we want to make sure to keep you as up to date as possible on progress. We want to make sure that we are dealing with a real person, or at least a reasonable facsimile of one. We also need a way to reach you in case there's any issue with the ad, as not to delay launch if avoidable.
How do I validate my email address?
Simply fill out the form and click submit. We'll send you an email within a few minutes with a link in it that verifies you are in fact you.
We ask you for your current password to make sure that someone isn't nefariously trying to change your email address (as it is the only way to get a password reset email).
I haven't gotten my validation email!
It may take a few minutes for your email to be delivered. If you check your spam box and it isn't there, please drop us an email at selfservicesupport@reddit.com and please include your username and a link to your campaign as it'll prevent us from having to email you back asking for it.
What's an interdomain redirect?
By "disallowing interdomain redirects" we mean that the top-level domain of the URL you submit should be the same as the final destination of the site.  We don't mind intermediate redirects for tracking purposes; we just want to make sure the domain of the link matches the domain of the actual page.
Why don't you allow interdomain redirects?
It makes our users sad (they feel like they are being lied to) and they will probably take it out on your link.
Where can I upload an image?
Before you upload an image, you have to submit your title and url and click "next" on the create promotion screen. You'll see the option available on the subsequent "edit" screen, scroll down and look for the "look and feel" section. Click "browse", choose the file, and click "upload". Then all the way at the bottom, click "save" and you should see your thumbnail to the left of the title.
How big of an image can I upload?
The thumbnail next to the sponsored link can be as large as 70x70 pixels.  Anything larger than 70 x 70 pixels will be automatically resized to fit in that area.  PNG format images are preferred. JPG format images are also allowed.
Creating a campaign
What's a campaign?
A campaign is the smallest unit of displaying a promotion. It provides the start date, stop date, the subreddit you'd like to target, and the total budget. The minimum budget required is $5 per campaign, and the maximum is $9,999. Each campaign can only target one subreddit.
Can I run multiple campaigns?
Of course you can! That's what the "+add new" button is for. There are no restrictions from one campaign to the next, and they can overlap and be a mix of targeted/untargeted. The copy and thumbnail will remain the same, and the vote count and comment section will be centralized into the one promotion.
What if I want to run an ad for a website that hasn't gone live yet?
Sorry, unless your website is up and running, we cannot approve it.
What is the soonest I can create a campaign?
When you create a new campaign, we require a 2 business day grace period before launch.
Two days!? isn't that a long time?
Yes it is, but it is only for your protection. All ads are currently approved by hand, by real human people, and we'd hate to have you bank on a date and not get it.  So for new ads, we ask that you schedule a couple of days in advance.
Once the link is approved, if you need it to run earlier than scheduled, send us an email with a link to your ad to selfservicesupport@reddit.com. We can try and get your ad live as quickly as we can.
Can I geotarget my ad?
No. At the moment we are only allowing targeting by subreddit, not by geography. We're working on some feature improvements at the moment, and this is definitely high up on the list!
Paying for your campaign
How do I pay for my campaign?
Once you've set up your campaign, click on the "create campaign" button. You'll notice that there is now a "pay" button next to the budget you specified. Clicking this will bring you to a page on our secure webserver for entering your credit card details. All credit card processing is done by Authorize.net (we don't store your credit card numbers). We accept all major credit cards, but currently have the restriction that they must have US, UK, or Canadian addresses.
Why only US, UK, and Canadian credit cards?  Redditors are from everywhere!
We know. We don't like it either. The reasons are purely legal, and we are working with our lawyers to amend the Terms of Service to include other jurisdictions.
My link is paid for. What do I do now?
Sit back and relax. We'll have a look at your link and make sure that everything is in order. If it is, you'll get an email saying that your ad has been approved and we'll keep you posted as it gets charged and later runs live.
Can I change my link?
Of course you can (provided it isn't currently running live). Just be aware that when you change it, it'll have to be reapproved. If it is near midnight and it is about to go live imminently, we can't necessarily guarantee we'll get to it in time and you might lose time, so beware.
Live links
When will my link start running?
We start ads at midnight EST.
Why do we do it this way?  We want to guarantee everyone gets their 24 hours without having to deal with time-changing funny-business.
We will send you an email when we charge your credit card (usually 12-24 hours before the link is to go live), when the link is live, and when it is finished.
Why I can't edit my link now that it is live?
Editing a link at any time dequeues the link and leads to the need for reapproval. Since we don't have an easy way to comp lost time, and can't guarantee that we are available to reapprove your ad as soon as you've changed it, we've disabled edits as long as the link is live.
That said, if you really need to change something once the link is live, feel free to email us at selfservicesupport@reddit.com and we'll make the edit for you.
What Happens if I cancel my live ad? Can I pause a live ad?
At the moment, we have no easy way to pro-rate ads if they are paused or canceled mid day. You can email selfservicesupport@reddit.com with takedown or pause requests, and we will do our best to work with you on a fix.
My ad is doing really well!  How can I extend it?
You can't edit a campaign once it is running, but you can add new campaigns. If you'd like to extend a running ad, just create a campaign that starts immediately after the current one ends and it will run uninterrupted. To do this, visit your campaigns dashboard (the "edit" link under the ads' title), and click the "+ add new" button.
If you'd like to increase traffic to a running ad, just add an overlapping campaign (with the restriction that the new campaign start no sooner than tomorrow).
Why did my ad get rejected?
We have strict criteria that we use to accept or reject ads. The main reasons for rejected ads are URL redirects/shorteners, links that don't work, links that can't be navigated away from easily, and sites under maintenance. As with all content on reddit, falsifying votes or comments is grounds for immediate rejection. We also reserve the right to reject any link we feel is inappropriate or falls into unapproved categories, for instance (but not limited to), dating services, gambling services, stalker services, “spam,” insincere, trickery, or misleading statements/claims about product/service, cash-for-click sites, etc. Adult content must be targeted to 18+ subreddits. We do not allow unlicensed use of the reddit alien logo in thumbnails or on websites, outside of widgets. We also reserve the right to not allow advertisements for services that violate the code of conduct or terms of service of another company, school, or service.
