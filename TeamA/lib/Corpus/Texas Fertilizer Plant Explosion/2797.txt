WASHINGTON, April 19 | 
        Fri Apr 19, 2013 10:52pm EDT


WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama
issued an emergency declaration for Texas on Friday to help the
state cope with the fallout from a deadly fertilizer plant
explosion.
The order authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency
to "identify, mobilize, and provide at its discretion, equipment
and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the
emergency."Wednesday's blast occurred at a fertilizer plant in the town
of West, Texas, and killed at least 14 people, including
volunteer firefighters who raced to the scene to douse a blaze.
Authorities said 200 people were injured.There was no indication of foul play at the West Fertilizer
Co plant, a privately owned retail facility.Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas said the town's
deputy fire marshal told him that 60 people remained unaccounted
for."I want them to know that they are not forgotten," Obama
said in an appearance in the White House briefing room that
focused on the capture of the surviving suspect in the Boston
Marathon bombings."Our thoughts, our prayers, are with the people of West,
Texas, where so many people lost their lives, some lost their
homes, many are injured, many are still missing," Obama said."All in all, this has been a tough week."
