A video I made for the song Feel The Force by The Cross, which was released only on the US LP, and as the B side on the Shove It single. Written by Roger Taylor.Lyrics:You can touch, but you don't feelNo, you ain't deaf, but you don't hearYou can hurt, but you can healThough you ain't blind, you still can't seeOr learn to feelYou can raise your hand, but you can't reachYou can pray and you can preachLift up your voice, know where its coming onNo matter how, jump and shoutAnd let it outFeel the force, it lifts you up, it takes you outFeel the force, you just can't stopIt makes you sing and want to shoutAnd tear down your prison wallsLike they ain't there at allAnd if you think, there's no set heat, now listenJust when you think you're trapped you must be strongCos who's to tell you just what's right or wrongYour mortal mind will show you just which road to travel onFeel the force, it lifts you up, it takes you outFeel the force, you just can't stopIt makes you sing and want to shoutAnd tear down your prison wallsLike they ain't there at allFeel the forceFeel the forceAnd tear down your prison wallsLike they ain't there at allFeel the force, it lifts you up, it takes you outFeel the force, you just can't stopIt makes you sing and want to shoutAnd tear down your prison wallsLike they ain't there at allI want you to feelI want you to feelFeel the force-------------------------------------"Freddie Mercury" "Roger Taylor" "Brian May" "John Deacon" "Bohemian Rhapsody" "Don't Stop Me Now" "I Want It All" "Somebody To Love" "These Are The Days Of Our Lives" "We Will Rock You" "We Are The Champions" "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" "Fat Bottomed Girls" "Bicycle Race" "Play The Game" "A Kind Of Magic" "Innuendo" "Another One Bites The Dust" "Killer Queen" "You're My Best Friend" "Breakthru" "Body Language" "Under Pressure" "Who Wants To Live Forever""Wembley" "I'm Going Slightly Mad" "Breakthru" "Barcelona" "Scandal" "Mother Love" "The Miracle" "Radio Ga Ga" "Heaven For Everyone" "One Vision" "Hammer To Fall" "I Want To Break Free" Queen Queen II Sheer Heart Attack A Night at the Opera A Day at the Races News of the World Jazz The Game Flash Gordon Hot Space The Works A Kind of Magic The Miracle Innuendo Made in Heaven Queen + Paul Rodgers At the Beeb Greatest Hits Classic Queen Queen Rocks Greatest Hits III Stone Cold Classics Live at Wembley 1986 Queen on Fire Live at the Bowl Return of the Champions Queen Rock Montreal The Cross Ibex Larry Lurex Smile The eYe We Will Rock You musical WWRY
