I was doubting the idea that an insurance policy might exist for conscious law-breaking.

I don't watch the sport, so if you don't mind; Why would they need to win by 2? Is that a rule?

permalinksavecontextfull comments (80)Celebration got a bit awkward  by  [deleted]in  funny[+]PinkyShin08 -1 points0 points1 point 11 days ago  (0 children)[–]PinkyShin08 -1 points0 points1 point 11 days agoThat's not the best way to do it either. The way you describe it makes it so that if you're holding the bottle at the front or middle, the fulcrum force developed by tapping the 57 does not bring out the ketchup. And this way, you also have a chance to break the neck of the bottle by hitting it sideways, which is the easiest way to break the bottle.  This way would only work if the bottle has a good amount of ketchup (more than where you're holding it), or if you are hitting it really hard.
The best way to get ketchup out of those bottles is to hold with one hand, then move it and hit it against the other hand. Kind of like getting into a car crash. You move the bottle forward creating momentum, then suddenly stop it so that the ketchup comes out.
Or you can stick your knife in it like a savage.

But in all honestly, you can't expect "all you can eat" kobe beef for $20.00. It sounds shiesty, but it's a business that sells cheaper cuts for a cheaper price. But I do agree, they shouldn't be allowed to say "Kobe" beef. 
But $20.00 for all you can eat meat isn't so bad, even if it isn't Kobe beef. Mmm

I think a person can save someone's life if they are OR can provide a reason for a person to keep going when they're so close to giving up. That's more of "saving a life" than "postponing death"
