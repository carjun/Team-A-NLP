Trying to promote your book?
/r/Books is rather large, and popular books get the most attention. Tt is not perfect for new authors to get their books noticed. New authors are encouraged to post in /r/wroteabook and do an AMA here in /r/Books
If you are an author and want to do an AMA, please message the mods ahead of time. We will put an announcement up for the whole community!
Please do not misrepresent yourself or use multiple accounts to promote your books, any spammer accounts will be banned



Post not showing up?
The spam filter sometimes eats posts by mistake. If your post is missing, please send a link to the mods and we will fix it ASAP
