Texas town mourns victims, including first responders after fertilizer depot blast



Video: 
Three members of the Texas congressional delegation, including Sen. John Cornyn, got a firsthand view of the aftermath of this week's massive fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas.

 WEST, Tex. — In this tiny town, the enormous loss caused by a massive fertilizer plant explosion was just starting to sink in on Friday, as talk about deaths and missing people was passed by word of mouth, drawing sighs, gasps and tears.
“It’s going to be tough for the families,” said Deborah Sulak, 51, a cashier at a small grocery store just around the corner from the fire station. “But we’re going to rebound. We’re fighters.”

Fertilizer facility explodes in central Texas: A massive explosion on Wednesday night at a fertilizer facility in West, Tex., left more than 160 people wounded and killed an estimated five to 15 people , officials said, likely including firefighters who had been battling the blaze at the factory that triggered the explosion. West is 20 miles north of Waco.












At a late-afternoon news conference Friday, Mayor Tommy Muska confirmed that 14 bodies had been recovered, including those of five volunteer firefighters — one of whom was the city manager — and four emergency medical technicians. Most had rushed to West Fertilizer on Wednesday night when it erupted in a fireball, causing widespread damage. “It’s devastating,” Muska said. “I have been a member of the fire department for 26 years. These guys were my friends.” A West firefighter said his colleagues acted bravely in an effort to contain the blaze while nearby residents were being evacuated. “It grew and it grew and they weren’t able to flee before the blast,” said Florentino Perez. “They were trying to connect the hose to the hydrant when it went boom.”At the end of a week that has kept Americans on edge, following Monday’s bombings in Boston and ricin-laced letters mailed to members of Congress, there was something conspicuously absent here, in this town that takes great pride in its deep Czech roots: a search for a villain.“You can’t really blame anyone,” Perez said. “Only God knows why this happened.”The fertilizer plant had been on fire once before, nearly a decade ago, and the all-volunteer West Fire Department had managed to put it out before it spread to a nearby school and homes.Perhaps with that in mind, a handful of the city’s firefighters rushed to the edge of the swelling flames Wednesday night and drained the water tank on one of their trucks. With the fire untamed, they started to connect a hose to the nearest fire hydrant when a gargantuan ball of fire shot into the sky in this rural farm town of 2,800 people, leveling dozens of homes and making the earth rattle for miles.“This was a horrible accident, and we’re going to have to move on as a community,” Sulak said. “It’s going to be millions and millions of dollars and an awful loss of life.” The first responders killed Wednesday night were hailed as heroes. Dallas Fire and Rescue Capt. Kenny Harris, 52, a resident of West, was among them, according to the City of Dallas. Harris was off-duty when the blaze began, but he rushed to help.“Captain Harris rushed to the scene compelled to provide assistance to his community during a crisis,” Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said in a statement.Chris Barron, the head of the Firemen’s and Fire Marshal’s Association of Texas, said at least 20 of West’s 29 firefighters had advanced training that includes basic knowledge of responding to fires in areas that store “hazardous material.” He said even big-city fire departments struggle with such fires, noting that it presented an enormous challenge to the city’s tiny force.
