What do you recommend I see/try/eat/drink? (self.texas)submitted 2 days ago by Ganonderp_24 commentssharecancelall 24 commentssorted by: bestbesttopnewhotcontroversialoldrandom[+]jjmoreta 7 points8 points9 points 2 days ago* (5 children)[–]jjmoreta 7 points8 points9 points 2 days ago*Food: 
Start here with the list of all the finalists and winners of the 2005-2013 Fried Food contests. Pick a few items that sound awesome to you, most of the winners are still sold year-to-year. The program guide has a map to the stands selling this year's finalists.
Past favorites of mine that I would get again: Hans Kraut Ball, Fernie's Deep Fried Peaches & Cream, Donkey Tails
Everyone will tell you how good Fletcher's Corny Dogs are. However, if you did not grow up around here, it probably not taste like you expect a corn dog to (could be a good thing or a bad thing). Fletcher's batter is not sweet and is a little grainy, like traditional cornbread is. If you have to have a corn dog and you want a traditional Midwestern sweet batter, there's a stand to the right of Big Tex that sells excellent footlong corn dogs.
Activities: 
What do you like to do and what is your budget? I've never been to the Minnesota State Fair but I went to the Iowa State Fair almost every year growing up.
As you walk around, take time to appreciate the exquisite Art Deco architecture of Fair Park, decorated with statues and murals. Most of the buildings were built for the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition. The Texas State Fair started in 1886.
The Chinese Lantern festival was awesome last year. They only accept State Fair tickets for payment. Last year it was cheaper before 5pm but you couldn't leave/reenter. This year you can leave/reenter but I don't know about timing discounts.
If you like cars or are shopping for one, the Auto Show is huge. It's in the two buildings on either side of the Esplanade (large rectangle pool). I usually don't bother unless I need an A/C break or its raining.
I recommend walking into the Hall of State for a few minutes. They're having an exhibit on Big Tex this year but the hall itself is beautiful inside.
Then amble over to Big Tex's plaza, take your picture with him and wait for him to say something. He burned last year so this year is a new mold with a deeper tan. If you find him creepy, you're not alone, but keep it to yourself. He's an 50+ year icon of the fair.
You can get your butter sculpture fix at the Creative Arts Pavilion, as well as see all the beautiful craft blue ribbon winners. I usually have a friend or two displaying so it's a never-miss for me. Then pop across the road to the Food & Fiber pavilion for a few samples, see Elsie the Borden cow (the $1 milk is a Fair bargain) and you can buy Texas-made food products in the middle. Make sure you get a Dublin/non-corn syrup Dr Pepper.
Most of the Midway consists of fair rides and carnie games. The Fair Park exclusives are the Log Flume (tame), Texas Star (expensive, can be long wait, worth riding once), the Skyway (expensive), and the (new this year) Top of Texas Tower. I might do the Tower this year. 
At night, unless you don't care about standing for long periods of time or not having a front seat, choose between the parade (7:15pm) and the Illumination Sensation (8pm). I personally prefer the Illumination Sensation, which is patriotic music videos with fireworks and flamethrower accompaniment. The parade is an electrical parade. Once its over, there's a big rush to Illumination.
Do you like shopping? Corporate exhibits giving away freebies? Flea market and sold-on-TV stuff? Animals? Taking kids with you? I can recommend more stuff based on your interests...

permalinksave[+]Ganonderp_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (2 children)[–]Ganonderp_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI think I'm most interested in trying different foods.  Probably not going to do too much shopping.

permalinksaveparent[+]jjmoreta 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]jjmoreta 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoMost of the food is scattered around the main walkways and Midway so you'll see the different options. Bring plenty of money for tickets since everything is $4 and up. Cash lines for tickets move much faster.
Oh make sure you don't miss the food court in the Embarcadero. Last year I bought a plate of Texas Twisters (fried spiral cut potatoes with cheese) as large as my head.
And I found this list of new foods at the fair this year. There's a couple of things on there I must try!

permalinksaveparent[+]jjmoreta 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]jjmoreta 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoJust found on the Texas State Fair FB page:
If you're headed to the Fair this weekend, you've got to check out the USAF flight simulator! The simulator lets you experience an Air Force mission from a first person perspective, including an F-22 interceptor mission and a Special Forces mission. Check it out near the foot of the Top o' Texas Tower. Here 'till Sunday.

permalinksaveparent[+]randomtexanyall 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (1 child)[–]randomtexanyall 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI'm interested in the freebies, if you know of any

permalinksaveparent[+]jjmoreta 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]jjmoreta 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoMost of the corporate booths like to set up in the area between the Coliseum and the Midway (look for the Chevy Ride and Drive area). We miss this most of the time, but now that the train museum is gone, we'll have an extra hour. 
Sometimes you'll have to sit through a short presentation or walk through an area. In the past we've found freebies from from free toothpaste samples (Sensodyne) to a free beard trim (Braun?). Last year (or the year before) there was a cool Lego area for the kids. 
Sometimes the auto show vendors have freebies, but its usually brand swag like reusable bags.

permalinksaveparent[+]sexandliquor 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago  (6 children)[–]sexandliquor 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoALL the fried things!

permalinksave[+]Ganonderp_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (2 children)[–]Ganonderp_[S] 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoOh, you bet I plan to eat all sorts of gluttonous fried foods!  But there are so many options, I was hoping for suggestions.

i believe this will be of interest to you

permalinksaveparent[+]TerracottaSoldier 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]TerracottaSoldier 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoFried tres leches and the chicken and waffle on a stick was great. Also loved the alligator sausage. I wanted to try the fried thanksgiving.

permalinksaveparent[+]JustMe8born and bred 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (2 children)[–]JustMe8born and bred 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThe Iowa fair is said to have more fried food than we do. I don't know how that could be. The mind boggles. 

permalinksaveparent[+]jjmoreta 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (1 child)[–]jjmoreta 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoI don't believe that for a minute. 
Cable TV makes a deep fried fair cooking competition show (Deep Fried Masters) and where do they find 2 out of the 3 judges? Texas guys Abel Gonzales and Butch Benavides!
Besides the Iowa State Fair's gimmick is the stick. They had over 60 foods sold on a stick this year.

permalinksaveparent[+]JustMe8born and bred 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]JustMe8born and bred 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoLike I said, I don't know how they could. But I know a lot of people in DC, and the WaPo writers are all big on the Iowa Fair for some reason. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Dont_touch_the_trim 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]Dont_touch_the_trim 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoEat everything. It only comes around once a year. But you must work out for 355 consecutive days or the cholesterol will take over your blood vessels.

permalinksave[+]LegendaryCatalyst 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]LegendaryCatalyst 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoFried turkey legs are an absolute must, funnel cake is always delicious. 

permalinksave[+]rap31264 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]rap31264 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoThey probably don't have them in the SF but try out a Whataburger...They're all over Dallas...

permalinksave[+]Darkside_Hero 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Darkside_Hero 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours agoCheck out the Birds of the World show. This is the last year they will be at the State Fair. :(

permalinksave[+]Rodairborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]Rodairborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 2 days agoSugar frosted deep fried crisco is awesome! Dr. Jack Kevorkian loves them. 

permalinksave[+]synobal  comment score below threshold  (5 children)[–]synobal -8 points-7 points-6 points 2 days ago*Stay away from the fried foods. Seriously they are more than anything to make you sick. 

permalinksave[+]Ganonderp_[S] 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago  (2 children)[–]Ganonderp_[S] 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoBut isn't that kind of the point?

permalinksaveparent[+]jjmoreta 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]jjmoreta 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoExactly. Once a year is not going to kill you. Most of the serving sizes are not that large.
But hey it's your fair, you enjoy your gluten free salad and I'll eat something fried I probably wouldn't eat the other 363 days of the year...

permalinksaveparent[+]synobal -2 points-1 points0 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]synobal -2 points-1 points0 points 2 days agoI dunno do you enjoy being sick? 

permalinksaveparent[+]Miggsy 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]Miggsy 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoNo, no it's the rides that are designed to make you sick

permalinksaveparent[+]JustMe8born and bred 0 points1 point2 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]JustMe8born and bred 0 points1 point2 points 2 days agoYou don't have to eat them all, and you don't have to eat them every day. This is a fair; enjoy the day.
