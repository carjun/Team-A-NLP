Maybe close to Iniesta too, but he seems to sit deeper.

I was in about third grade and the book fair had come to my school. An exciting time when you're that age. Now for this book fair they also brought book covers that were to be cut and applied with some tape on your own at home, for the in-class textbooks we had. So there I am at home, happily trying to apply it how i know, and then along comes my dad. He thinks I'm doing it wrong and to be honest, I probably was. At this point he decides to try and force me to do it the "right" way(because honestly, i cant remember if he knew the right way either), but because I'm young, i dont understand fully. After a struggle of about 5 minutes to get me to do it right, he stands up and says, "you're an idiot"
And I really dont remember what happened after that. All I can remember is that point, what he said. The venomous tone with which he said it.
My self-esteem has never recovered.
Thanks to anyone that listened for letting me vent, I've had that in me for a long time.
