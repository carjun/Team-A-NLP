Connected to the Florida peninsula by a sliver of land, Cape San Blas is home to St. Joseph Peninsula State Park, named the best beach in America (2002) by Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman (a.k.a. Dr. Beach). Cape San Blas, located near Port St. Joe along the Florida Panhandle's Emerald Coast, is truly a vacation paradise. Here, you'll find miles of uncrowded, pristine, white sand beaches. Among the other attractions: Pet-friendly vacation rentals, fishing, kayaking and boating, family-owned restaurants serving fresh Florida seafood, and the famed Cape San Blas lighthouse.
