only 45 states have adopted the CCSS. 

Only? Only 90% of all states have chosen to participate in CCSS.
Several is not the term I would use to describe the 5 out of 50 that are not participating.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (25)8 Papa John's Suddenly Close on Payday, leaving myself and 50+ other employees without pay for our last 2 weeks. The same owners have another franchise open and run by Papa John's.  by  ChumtheWatersin  pics[+]Covri -1 points0 points1 point 9 days ago  (0 children)[–]Covri -1 points0 points1 point 9 days ago
But this doesn't happen if the top levels of the corporation are running a good ship. I am an employee for Chic-Fil-A. Even though Chic-Fil-A has independent franchises, the top levels take responsibility in making sure that their store owners are prepared enough to operate a successful store that can take care of its employees and is ethically sound. While each location may be privately owned, there can still be no excuses made, pardoning the upper levels of the company when problems arise. The top levels of the company are ultimately responsible; unethical practices can affect a company like the plague, and this isn't the first time I've heard of corruption and unfair dealings within Papa John's. But when you operate a business with only net profit in mind, these are the results. You would never see this kind of thing happening at Chic-Fil-A, I can guarantee you that.

Unless you're homosexual, right?

I was kinda hoping that was true so I wouldn't have to worry about roaches coming through the machine.

Any Wendy's former/present employees care to weigh in on whether that is an accurate statement about the machine?

Could the DQ employee have just meant that they don't sell a chocolate soft serve, but rather a vanilla soft serve with chocolate syrup added when the customer orders it? I know it's basically the same thing in the end, but it wouldn't be technically incorrect. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (613)Sidebar suggestion  by  GGStokesin  falcons[+]Covri 3 points4 points5 points 11 days ago  (0 children)[–]Covri 3 points4 points5 points 11 days agoThis is not a sidebar suggestion, but a suggestion for the mods none the less. I was just checking out the Browns subreddit to see their reaction to trading Richardson and noticed that their upvote arrow is the browns logo and their downvote arrow is the Vikings logo (their opponent this week, it changes each week I assume). 
I'm thinking we should incorporate that idea to our subreddit, but just have it be the Falcons logo to upvote and downvote be the Saints logo all the time.
Make it happen Mods.

Don't use it as a debit card anywhere because they charge $.50 a transaction for that so use it as a credit card every time. There was a higher one atm that didn't charge a fee in the union, but not sure where that would be now.

I just said it was fucked up that the five guys employees just assumed that the only reason a big dude would order a single party burger was because he was too poor to afford the regular and so they'll just hook him up because they know that's what he really wants. You know, because he's a big dude.

Also if you're a big looking dude and the store's empty, ask for a little burger and half the time you'll get a free 2nd patty

That's kinda fucked up, honestly. Maybe big dude didn't want the extra burger and that's why he didn't order it.

Fuck letting a player show me up no matter how shitty they think I am. If Kiffin doesn't do anything, he has no chance of ever reclaiming the team. 
With the talent USC has they should have won without even worrying about the coaches. Sounds like a bunch of entitled kids pointing the blame towards a bunch of entitled coaches.
