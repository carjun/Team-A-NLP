I'm sure to them "literary value" is having a man walk on water and doing other various "miracles". Bullshit, complete and utter bullshit.

It's just filled with commercialism, fake smiles, and pretending that you actually care about your extended (and immediate) family.

I feel as if I'm the only atheist around here (even though I know statistically that that isn't possible). I'm sure that eventually I'll find my own little niche of non-believers. :D

Joseph Fink and everyone else working on the project and at Commonplace Books really deserve the attention. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (3)What is your least favourite/most hated Silent Hill game?  by  Player_Slayer_7in  silenthill[+]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 1 month ago  (0 children)[–]TheEccentricSpeaker 0 points1 point2 points 1 month agoWithout a doubt Homecoming. The characters were annoying, the story was dull, and the gameplay was absolutely horrendous. In my opinion, I don't even consider Homecoming as a part of the Silent Hill series. It strays too far from the original lore and relies on the movie to let it be called a "Silent Hill" game. Plus, that bullshit introduction that was stolen directly from Jacob's Ladder made me automatically dislike the game.
