Outside of fishing, recreation on the water typically breaks down into two groups: adrenaline junkies and nature watchers — and there's usually not a lot of common ground between them. At one extreme you have the waterskier-wakeboarder-kitesurfer, and at the other someone is paddling around on a kayak with binoculars and a pocket wildlife guide. Beaches & Adventure Insider Lauren Tjaden has found an attraction that appeals to both camps. Dolphin Ecotours in the waters around Fort Myers' Estero Bay mixes the excitement of zipping around on personal water scooters with the sheer wonder that comes with encountering some of Florida's most amazing marine mammals and a beautiful, natural setting.
