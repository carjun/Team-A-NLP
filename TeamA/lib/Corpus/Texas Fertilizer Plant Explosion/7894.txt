Submission Rules

This is a Human Portrait subreddit. Not anything with humans in it subreddit. For non-portrait images of people please visit /r/EarthlingPorn.
Having a picture with just one person as the focus is more valuable than one with hundreds and nothing is visible.
Include as much context about the image in the title as possible.
Include the resolution in [brackets] in the title.
Only submit static images.


Videos, collections, interactive images/websites, and articles are not allowed.
Do not submit a shortened link using a URL shortener like tinyurl.

Make sure your image is hosted by an approved host.


Original source is allowed and preferred over the approved hosts. If your submission is not on the list of approved hosts, but it is an original source, please use the tag [OS] so your submission is not removed in error. If your image is rehosted from another approved host it will be removed.
If you took the photo yourself, you can signify this by using the tag [OC] (original content) and after 24 hours you will be given special flair. If you don't receive flair after a few days feel free to message the mods.

Do not submit:


Images that don't include people.
Images that are close ups of one body part. Example eyes, lips, etc.
Images of people that have been photoshopped.
Images of silhouette(s) or back of heads of people.
Images where the focus is the location and not the person in the picture.

If you have any questions check out the FAQ.


Comment and Submission Rules

Personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form is not allowed and will be removed.
Keep the discussion on-topic. Comments that do not directly add to the discussion will be removed.
