Buy on iTunes http://bit.ly/LcgjVbIf you like please join subscribe and even go to my official website at http://www.justindmusic.co.ukI wrote this song based on the idea I had for a video. I also wanted to firstly write a song with double meaning. Could by written about a relationship that had ended... or about death. I was hoping that more people could connect with the lyrics. Wanted the video to be about denial and how it can never override the truth.A massive thanks to all these people:Directed, Edited by LoonyTick Productionswww.loonytickproductions.co.ukSong written and performed by Justin Daurat (Vocals and Guitar)Strings written and arranged by Justin DauratViolin performed by Meg Veale - Cello performed by Rosalind GladstoneLead acted by Natalie Taylorhttp://www.starnow.co.uk/nataliet225674Make Up by Natalie Munns and Kayleigh Saundershttp://www.starnow.co.uk/kayleighsaun...Mastered by Venti Venti Media Ltdhttp://www.facebook.com/ventiventiEVERY scene was filmed at SoundBite Studioshttp://www.facebook.com/SoundbiteEventsYoung Rob for being the best runner aboot and being a genuine and lovely bloke!The Extras for their professionalism on the day, in the rain and the cold!Vic Waghorn (Especially for lending me the Bow Tie) Darren Ferrari and Steve Phipps for helping us get the camera angle we needed...Raw Spares for supplying us with the BMW'shttp://www.rawspares.co.uk/The supporters that are in my life and also those that flutter around it.You for helping my play count go up one.________________________________Loonytick productions(Facebook) - https://www.Facebook.Com/pages/loonyt...(Youtube) - coming soonLinksLoonytick Productions(Facebook) - https://www.Facebook.Com/pages/loonyt...(Youtube) - http://www.youtube.com/user/Loonytick...We want the charity THINK! to use this for their next Drink Driving Campaign.
