"Immigrants" don't sneak across international borders illegally.

permalinksaveparent[+]MEGABITE1 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours ago  (5 children)[–]MEGABITE1 0 points1 point2 points 21 hours agoCalling them immigrants is a slap to the face of all of the people who actually took the time and effort to come here the right way. They obviously think they can skip the line and do whatever they want.

permalinksaveparent[+]Vee_Vee -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours ago  (4 children)[–]Vee_Vee -2 points-1 points0 points 21 hours agothat's why I called the illegal immigrants. You're talking semantics, but they are immigrants nonetheless.

permalinksaveparent[+]MEGABITE1 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours ago  (3 children)[–]MEGABITE1 0 points1 point2 points 20 hours agoYou can call them that if you want to. I refuse to. I don't sugar coat things.

permalinksaveparent[+]Vee_Vee -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours ago  (2 children)[–]Vee_Vee -2 points-1 points0 points 19 hours agome neither. they are illegally immigrataing from their country to ours, which makes them illegal immigrants. It's really just plain English, but you're Texan, so I wouldn't expect you to understand plain English.
