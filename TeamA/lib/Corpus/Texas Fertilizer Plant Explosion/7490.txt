Reddit news stories will often make a big splash but their resolution or progress will not share the same front page visibility. This subreddit is for that content.
Examples 

Disasters and their recovery efforts. 
Investigation of Political Scandals 
Slow-moving legislation 
Ongoing World Events 
Slow-moving court cases. 
Newsworthy Reddit events

Rules & Guidelines

As is customary in other news subreddits, please refrain from editorializing/sensationalizing your post titles, and do your best to make sure your title is not misleading or biased. (Ex: "Federal Judge Accused of Corruption" vs. "Another sleazy politician; hang them all")
Cross-posts are strongly encouraged.  If you see an update to an event in a subreddit dedicated to that topic, cross-post it here. Test PAC, ACTA/PIPA/SOPA all have subreddits dedicated to following them, but someone may not be subscribed to everything that that they are interested in seeing updates on.
Self-post are also encouraged.  If you have multiple links and sources for an update, please consider making a self-post.
Asking for an update is also permitted and encouraged.  If you don't know what the latest is, feel free to ask.
There are no rules for content.  An update to any story is allowed, even if it's not that notable.  (That's what voting is for.)  *The only exception to this are updates to /r/AskReddit posts.  Please use /r/AskedReddit for those updates.
[Meta] Posts are also permitted, so long as they are tagged as such.  It is our hope that this will be a community driven subreddit.  
Self-posts should be sourced with links under any updates/results.
While not required, it is preferred if you are cross-posting something from another subreddit, you credit the sub at the end of the title.  [x-posted from /r/news]
