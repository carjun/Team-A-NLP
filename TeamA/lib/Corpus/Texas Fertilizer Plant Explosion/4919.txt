permalinksave[+]gelightful 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]gelightful 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoVoting law opponents contend these laws disproportionately affect elderly, minority and low-income groups that tend to vote Democratic. Obtaining photo ID can be costly and burdensome, with even free state ID requiring documents like a birth certificate that can cost up to $25 in some places. According to a study from NYU's Brennan Center, 11 percent of voting-age citizens lack necessary photo ID while many people in rural areas have trouble accessing ID offices. During closing arguments in a recent case over Texas's voter ID law, a lawyer for the state brushed aside these obstacles as the "reality to life of choosing to live in that part of Texas."
Attorney General Eric Holder and others have compared the laws to a poll tax, in which Southern states during the Jim Crow era imposed voting fees, which discouraged blacks, and even some poor whites -- until the passage of grandfather clauses -- from voting.
Given the sometimes costly steps required to obtain needed documents today, legal scholars argue that photo ID laws create a new "financial barrier to the ballot box."

permalinksaveparent[+]BrianPurkissborn and bred 14 points15 points16 points 1 day ago  (32 children)[–]BrianPurkissborn and bred 14 points15 points16 points 1 day agoIn order for me to perform a wide variety of menial tasks, like buy a gun, get a hunting license, drive a car, buy alcohol or tobacco I have to have an ID. In order to get a job I need an ID! 
But to vote, one of the most important and influential tasks a citizen can take, no proof of ID is required. 
That is illogical. 
Why do I need an ID for a job but not to vote? 
Requiring an ID has nothing to do with fairness. It is all about proving citizenship and preventing voter fraud. 
What's more, getting an ID is incredibly cheap and easy. If I'm not mistaken, citizens can get an ID for free. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Kar98_Byf42got here fast 8 points9 points10 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Kar98_Byf42got here fast 8 points9 points10 points 1 day ago
If I'm not mistaken, citizens can get an ID for free. 

Hell even non-citizens can.

permalinksaveparent[+]WeeblsLikePie -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (5 children)[–]WeeblsLikePie -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoWell you can look at this two ways: voting is incredibly important and influential so we should a) make it as easy as possible for citizens to exercise this right or b) put restrictions on it.
I could agree with restrictions if I saw some compelling evidence that they achieved a worthwhile goal.  But so far most of the voter fraud cases I've seen news of have been tea-party types trying to prove how easy it is to commit voter fraud.

permalinksaveparent[+]BrianPurkissborn and bred 3 points4 points5 points 1 day ago  (4 children)[–]BrianPurkissborn and bred 3 points4 points5 points 1 day agoYou're using a logical fallacy - a loaded question. 
I agree with making voting easy. Which is why there are programs in place for making it easy for people to vote if they can't leave home or if they have difficulty getting an ID - which is something contributing members of society should have. For the few exceptions out there, which I'm sure there some legitimate people who don't have an ID - and they can get one. 
But the simple fact is - IDs are required for many things in life - they should be required for the most important thing the average citizen can do. 

permalinksaveparent[+]WeeblsLikePie 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (3 children)[–]WeeblsLikePie 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoWhy?  What problem is requiring ID solving?  As far as I can tell you're trying to solve a problem that does not exist.
You're simply saying "because it's important ID should be required."  But I don't see any solid reasoning behind it.

permalinksaveparent[+]BrianPurkissborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]BrianPurkissborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoNo. The point of the ID is proof. Proof you can legally vote and you are who you say you are. 
Just like I need proof that I can drink. 
The point is preventing voter fraud - which does happen - despite the liberal media's claims. 

permalinksaveparent[+]WeeblsLikePie 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]WeeblsLikePie 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago
Just like I need proof that I can drink.

But there are good statistics showing that drunken driving and deaths due to drunken driving both go up when the drinking age is lower than 21.  So there's a reasonable basis, and a problem being solved by requiring proof of age to drink.

he point is preventing voter fraud - which does happen - despite the liberal media's claims.

So you claim that voter fraud does happen.  But there's really very little evidence that voter fraud happens at all. The best statistics I could show about 2000 criminal cases involving voting irregularities since the year 2000.  Of those 10 involved in-person voter impersonation.
There were 491 cases of fraud involving absentee ballots.  Which voter ID would do nothing to solve.  And that's in a country with ~150 million registered voters across 10 years.  The rest of the allegations were elections officials and voter intimidation--things like that that aren't to do with fraudulently casting a ballot.  So 501 cases in something like 1.5 billion votes cast (assuming each person votes once a year for 10 years).  That's a rate of .3 fraud cases per million votes. 
To me that doesn't rise to the level of actually being a problem.  If you require ID the number of people who are disenfranchised will absolutely be way bigger than the number of fraudulent votes avoided.  So to me that would be a failure of a policy.

permalinksaveparent[+]Chalools 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Chalools 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoThe reality is that we have a problem getting people to even show up to vote. The right to vote is not something that people are fighting over or breaking the law to do. On the contrary, Texas ranks 51st in the United States for voter turnout. So, any further hurdle to getting people to vote, especially the poor and disenfranchised who don't have a car or can't afford to take off work to spend an afternoon at the DPS to get an ID, is just lowering an already abysmal voter turnout record.

permalinksaveparent[+]Vee_Vee  comment score below threshold  (18 children)[–]Vee_Vee -6 points-5 points-4 points 1 day agoYou're assuming, as you all do, that these are people buying guns, hunting, driving cars, buying alcohol and tobacco, and even have jobs.  
If only everyone were just like you, you would be correct, but there are many who are not like you at all, and may only have expired ID's, or are old, and don't drive anywhere, or have a need for an ID.  
Students from out of state will not be able to vote here unlees they are a resident and have Texas issued ID. You think they're all going to send in absentee ballots? No, they aren't going to vote.  
The elderly, poor, and college students are probably not going to put in the effort to vote if they have to get an ID. THAT'S THE POINT.  

permalinksaveparent[+]BrianPurkissborn and bred 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (12 children)[–]BrianPurkissborn and bred 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoIf they are old or don't drive, then there are government programs can give people IDs for free and have them mailed strait to them. 
IDs are required for many menial things. Voting is much more important than them and IDs should also be required. 
If no ID is required for voting then there should be no ID required to drive, buy alcohol or tobacco, or a job, or fill in the blank.
Maybe there should be an amendment allowing for out of state IDs being valid provided that they can prove they're living in Texas. Because I'm assuming in state IDs being required is to prevent out of state people voting in Texas. Not sure on that point.

permalinksaveparent[+]BrianPurkissborn and bred 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (6 children)[–]BrianPurkissborn and bred 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoThere is evidence. There are plenty of instances of people voting for their dead relatives and the like. They'll do the same with claiming social security. 
You say it's stupid to have the same standards for requiring Ids. Why is it stupid to require an ID to buy alcohol but not to vote?

Even the attourney general can't make this claim.  
Here, since you're too lazy to prove me wrong yourself:  
"Abbott, who’s making his defense of the state’s voter ID law a centerpiece of his campaign for governor, has pursued 66 people on charges of voting irregularities since 2004. Only four cases involved someone illegally casting a ballot at a polling place where a picture ID would have prevented it."

4 cases....4   
FFS, wake up man.

permalinksaveparent[+]BrianPurkissborn and bred 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago  (4 children)[–]BrianPurkissborn and bred 0 points1 point2 points 1 day agoCall it laziness - I call it life. I don't have time to do all of this research for every person I encounter on the Internet who will ignore it. 
What's more - last time I talked to you you ignored every source I sent. You claimed you didn't agree with the people saying that stuff - so what they said was automatically wrong. Even though I linked to some of the same sites you linked to - like Forbes. I believe there was a MSNBC link in there (very liberal news source) and you ignored it. 
So why should I waste my time when you'll ignore anything I say because you disagree with it - no matter how sourced it is. Facts don't matter - because you don't agree with them to begin with. 
I see them pop up every election cycle.

Registering to vote is a burden. Therefore I shouldn't have to register to vote amirite?

You're right. We should have government employees come to everybody's house that way NO CITIZEN WILL EVER NEED BEAR THE BURDEN OF HAVING TO TRAVEL TO A VOTING SITE. 

permalinksaveparent[+]BrianPurkissborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]BrianPurkissborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoStand in line? That's a burden? For an ID that 99.99% of law abiding citizens should already have in one way or another? 
I can't believe people think standing in line for 10 minutes to an hour is a burden. I guess they must be leading very Cush lives for something that simple. 
So standing in line for an ID is a burden... But standing in line to vote is not a burden? How is that logical? 
And as has been stated several times. For those who are too old or are disabled or whatever reason can't leave their homes - they can vote or get an ID by mail. 
So standing in line is not a reason - nor a burden since you can vote and get an ID by mail. Heck. I got my latest ID by mail and I'm a fit 24 year old. 
So how is taking 2 hours (tops) out of your day some ungodly burden that people can't adjust their lives around?

permalinksaveparent[+]Vee_Vee  comment score below threshold  (3 children)[–]Vee_Vee -8 points-7 points-6 points 1 day agoThe kind of voter fraud that actually occurs today is not preventable with ID's. They are simply a means to disenfranchise voters. It's really that simple. This is a law to keep certain classes of people from voting. That's it. It won't prevent a single case of fraud.

permalinksaveparent[+]o_gborn and bred 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]o_gborn and bred 2 points3 points4 points 1 day agoI somehow doubt it's that simple. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Vee_Vee  comment score below threshold  (0 children)[–]Vee_Vee -6 points-5 points-4 points 1 day agoThere is no evidence that voter ID's prevent fraud, so why require them at all? It certainly is that simple.  
Show me evidence of more than two cases of voter fraud that would have been preventable with ID's.

Unbvelievable.

These days it's absentee ballots being cast by dead people and voting machines that count too many votes. Keep drinking the Greg Abbot kool-aid though, it makes you look real smart!
