© 2006 WMG"You Raise Me Up" by Josh Groban, from Closer.Connect with Josh:Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/joshgrobanTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/joshgrobanWebsite: http://www.joshgroban.com"You Raise Me Up " Lyrics:When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;When troubles come and my heart burdened be;Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,Until you come and sit awhile with me.You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;You raise me up... To more than I can be.You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;You raise me up... To more than I can be.There is no life - no life without its hunger;Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;But when you come and I am filled with wonder,Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;You raise me up... To more than I can be.You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;You raise me up... To more than I can be.You raise me up... To more than I can be.
