WEST, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Rick Perry says search and rescue operations have been largely completed in the small town where a fertilizer plant explosion killed 14 people and injured about 200 others.


Flanked by local officials, Perry told a Friday afternoon news conference that all affected buildings in West, Texas, had been cleared with possibly the exception of one burned home.


Officials had said earlier that they had searched and cleared 150 buildings by Friday morning and planned to examine another 25 during the day.
