Sweet Cassidy is a 2 year old Plott Hound mix that came to Father John's from a kill shelter down south.  She is a shy, timid girl but she is very sweet and affectionate once she gets to know you. Cassidy's way of first getting to know you is by sniffing your chin and then sniffing your forehead. Once she knows you, she'll dance around and will do somersaults to have her belly rubbed. The staff at the shelter has been working with her to get over her shyness.  Cassidy is a real beauty...very delicate looking.  She likes playing with her canine friends and go for walks.  She needs a patient human who will help her with her shyness. She bonds very quickly and is looking for someone to love! ADOPT CASSIDY
