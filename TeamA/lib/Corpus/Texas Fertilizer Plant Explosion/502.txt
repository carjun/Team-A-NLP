The fertilizer plant was next to a retirement home.

That just seems like poor zoning.

permalinksaveparent[+]ZombiePilot15 363 points364 points365 points 5 months ago  (53 children)[–]ZombiePilot15 363 points364 points365 points 5 months agoTexas is not notorious for its strict zoning laws.

permalinksaveparent[+]TreesACrowd 73 points74 points75 points 5 months ago  (10 children)[–]TreesACrowd 73 points74 points75 points 5 months agoHouston is not exemplary because it is an exception to zoning laws altogether. Almost every other city/town has some level of zoning, even if it is lax.

permalinksaveparent[+]ArchZodiac 14 points15 points16 points 5 months ago  (6 children)[–]ArchZodiac 14 points15 points16 points 5 months agoExactly. Houston is the only major city in the US with no zoning laws at all. I believe the last time we rejected it was back in 1993.

permalinksaveparent[+]VoodooWoman 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (5 children)[–]VoodooWoman 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoUm, okay, thanks but no thanks to that. Yikes.

permalinksaveparent[+]ArchZodiac 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (4 children)[–]ArchZodiac 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoIt isn't bad. Some things can make it weird, like where the occasional club will pop up, but all in all it works fine and you have the freedom to start a business wherever you see fit.

permalinksaveparent[+]Obnoxious_liberal 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (3 children)[–]Obnoxious_liberal 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoIt has far reaching effects on planning and development. Sprawl leads to more traffic, more pollution, and no planning. Of course, it also helps get prices down. 

permalinksaveparent[+]ArchZodiac 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]ArchZodiac 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoTraffic is one of the worst aspects of Houston. Pollution is also getting bad, but it depends which part of houston really you're living in since its so large.

permalinksaveparent[+]Obnoxious_liberal 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]Obnoxious_liberal 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoDue to the lack of planning and no will for a large rail system you can expect traffic to get much, much worse. We aren't expanding roads, we aren't expanding rail, but we are building everywhere. 

permalinksaveparentcontinue this thread[+]movzx 3 points4 points5 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]movzx 3 points4 points5 points 5 months agoDoesn't that just make his point even more? Guy says Texas isn't known for strict zoning laws, and he posts an example of the lax laws (in this case, no law).

permalinksaveparent[+]TreesACrowd 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]TreesACrowd 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoNot really. Houston stands alone in Texas; no other city lacks zoning laws. I'm not saying his point is wrong, just that Houston isn't exemplary of the rest of the state.
It's like saying, "Towns in Michigan are known for their high crime rate. Just look at Detroit."

permalinksaveparent[+]jdowpcs 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]jdowpcs 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoAs a resident of Houston, I always worry for people that live near several major plants on the East and Southern side. Residences within earshot of them, it's nuts - you couldn't pay me to live there. Luckily I live about 20 miles north of most of the plants.

permalinksaveparent[+]zimm3rmann 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]zimm3rmann 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoSupposedly it's because the land owner wanted way too much for that one square of parking lot. Galleria wouldn't buy, so he opened a hideous looking adult store.

permalinksaveparent[+]fixedtehknollpost 1 point2 points3 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]fixedtehknollpost 1 point2 points3 points 5 months agoThats a poor example.   Schools next to warehouse next to commercial next to residential is a better example.   
Yes, Houston zoning is a goddamn free for all but strip club locations as it pertains to commercial zoning isn't highly regulated in plenty of places.   And strip clubs locations are one of the few things regulated in Houston to any extent.

permalinksaveparent[+]fixedtehknollpost 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (1 child)[–]fixedtehknollpost 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoAnd here we are blaming the victims.  Classy.

permalinksaveparent[+]Bob3333 -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago* (0 children)[–]Bob3333 -1 points0 points1 point 5 months ago*Just because sometimes victims aren't to blame doesn't mean they are never to blame. People who believe the government doesn't have the right to segregate things like schools and nursing homes from chemical plants are, in fact, to blame to the extent that their beliefs guide laws and regulations which allow such a colocation to occur.
Freedom to have opinions doesn't mean immunity from the consequences of those opinions. When political beliefs are put into action they have real consequences and the people who put them into action are responsible.

permalinksaveparent[+]dhockey63 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]dhockey63 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoEh, some towns yes some no. It isnt like each town has uniform zoning laws. My city in North Texas is fairly smart with their zoning regulations

permalinksaveparent[+]uhohitslizz 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago  (0 children)[–]uhohitslizz 0 points1 point2 points 5 months agoHouston is one city, not representative of the entire state. Houston's land uses are restricted by covenants and deed restrictions so that's not that clever of a point either. Many cities in Texas do have stringent zoning regulations and the state has plenty of urban planning. Just calling out a dumb generalization.

permalinksaveparent[+]bufflo1993 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago* (0 children)[–]bufflo1993 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago*Its not like they could've put the schools and neighborhoods far away from the plant, the town is 1.6 miles; everything is going to be close to the plant. And they put the plant on the outskirts of the town.

permalinksaveparent[+]mutatron 80 points81 points82 points 5 months ago  (7 children)[–]mutatron 80 points81 points82 points 5 months agoAnd it only missed the community hospital by a couple of hundred feet. Also, the middle school is on fire. I estimate the blast radius was about 500 feet, with at least 50 homes within the blast radius, some of them only a block away.
And the fire was already burning for a while when it exploded.

permalinksaveparent[+]mutatron 7 points8 points9 points 5 months ago  (2 children)[–]mutatron 7 points8 points9 points 5 months agoI don't understand why more people weren't evacuated. There was a large ongoing fire, with firefighters and police at the scene. It had to have been going for long enough to get people out. One lady said her son was videoing it from someplace close by, and he got thrown back into the house behind him and she's taking him to the hospital.
If I were anywhere near a burning fertilizer plant, I'd skedaddle out of there. Don't people remember Oklahoma City?
