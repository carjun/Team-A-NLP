That "rainy day fund" that was discussed after the West explosion is used to keep Texas's credit score very high. Right now, our credit is one of the best in the country, if not the very best. This is also a reason why this fund was not tapped after West. It serves the state better when saved away. So, as opposed to just increasing spending on education, we'd have to increase taxes to do so to avoid tapping into that fund.

permalinksave[+]ConorKenny 28 points29 points30 points 2 days ago* (2 children)[–]ConorKenny 28 points29 points30 points 2 days ago*We didn't tap it after West because we were hoping the feds would pick up the tab. Opponents of raiding the rainy day fund in the Legislature were also unable to produce witnesses or research showing that tapping the fund would affect our credit rating.
Oh, and we actually have 2-3 times as much transportation debt as is in the rainy day fund:
http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/07/01/4976482/lawmakers-consider-higher-sales.html
The last two budgets have everything to do with an abstract notion that we should "hold the line" on spending and an ironclad commitment not to raise taxes. We're only tapping the fund now because 1) big business is freaking out about our water infrastructure and roads; and 2) the rainy day fund was actually going to get larger than it was allowed to be under law. 
Really, you need to be much more cynical about Texas government. We have a ton of debt. Financial decisions are made due to political pressure. The Rainy Day Fund's size has everything to do with politics and the fact that you need a 2/3 vote to tap it. Very little of this had anything to do with sound policy.
Edit:* Really, downvotes? I don't think I said anything controversial here. The public record is very clear that Perry wanted the feds to pick up the tab for west: http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2013/06/rick-perry-urges-obama-to-fork-over-federal-funds-for-fire-ravaged-west/
And our Republican Comptroller herself has said that, while a rainy day fund balance should be taken into account among other things, rating agencies do not look at specific amount or even have an articulated policy on such funds. The fact that we have about $10 billion more in transportation debt than we have in the rainy day fund should tell you that our credit rating depends far more on our ability to pay service on our debt, which is based on our taxable base vs. how much we tax it, than outright debt or savings. 
Facts are good! Myths are bad! I'm not making any arguments about what we should do, just about what is. This shouldn't be controversial.

permalinksaveparent[+]ConorKenny 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]ConorKenny 5 points6 points7 points 2 days agoI wanted to add that this is not to say that these outcomes are necessarily bad or that someone has played good political game to get the outcomes they want. Just that the last two sessions of budget policy vis a vis the Rainy Day Fund were not at all based on data or logic. It was pure politics and some actually very erroneous ideas about our finances. 
Pretty soon we will have to deal with that transportation debt, though. The bill is coming due and our gas tax doesn't raise much anymore since it's a set amount per gallon, not a percentage of sales. We need more money to pay off that $18 billion in debt and to finance roads for our booming population. I'd bet it takes another four years before we're willing to face the music, though. No one wants to face a Republican primary having voted to raise taxes, no matter how much we needed them. It will take big business promising the Republican leaders that they will have their back in the primary against the Tea Partiers.
It's just the way things are. None of this really has much to do with what I think should happen.

permalinksaveparent[+]IdeaLeuconoe 2 points3 points4 points 2 days ago  (4 children)[–]IdeaLeuconoe 2 points3 points4 points 2 days agoMy friend is a teacher in the Texas public school system. Her school provides no textbooks for the students. At all. In class the students have to listen to my friend, who is a reality-TV addict and has never in her life read a book voluntarily, read from her book or slides while they take notes. One time she spent an entire class telling them all about ancient Greek civilization, only to realize when she got home that she had actually read them her notes on Roman civilization.  She thought it was hilarious, but the thought that these kids had to listen to a crappy teacher spout nonsense about history she has no business teaching without even a book to check out the facts at home made me want to vomit.  Any system that won't even provide textbooks for the students is a colossal failure. 

permalinksaveparent[+]fidel-cashfloborn and bred 1 point2 points3 points 2 days ago  (1 child)[–]fidel-cashfloborn and bred 1 point2 points3 points 2 days agoGiving young kids a textbook is  not going to solve poor teachers.... And I cannot possibly believe that the school doesn't give out textbooks.  All public schools are mandated to choose from a specific pool of books so its not an option for the school to just not have them. Perhaps poor administration at the school?

permalinksaveparent[+]IdeaLeuconoe 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours ago  (0 children)[–]IdeaLeuconoe 0 points1 point2 points 13 hours agoWhat they told her is that they no longer check out books because the kids would destroy them every year.  Hard to believe they wouldn't just charge the parents, but the part about them not having books to take home is absolutely true.

I also like Texas enough to move there and vote to keep things the way they are. It's moronic Californians who move to and want to push the mistaken policies of their state on the native Texans that give us a bad name.

permalinksaveparent[+]jaypaulstrongborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day ago  (2 children)[–]jaypaulstrongborn and bred -1 points0 points1 point 1 day agoWell there is good and bad everywhere you go. Our state has no shortage of idiotic policies. When it comes to the economy however, we are clearly doing something right. Granted it's not perfect. We still have a huge and growing debt problem ourselves. Of course, our problem comes more from our inability to keep up with the rapid population growth than from a spend-happy legislature. I think you will find most natives here will be very friendly with you, even if you show up in a Prius with a California license plate and an "Obama 2012" bumper sticker. 

permalinksaveparent[+]Superdanger 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (1 child)[–]Superdanger 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI spent the last 3 years in Fort Worth, it was only recently that I moved back to California. We are realizing our mistake and decided that I should move back before it's too late. True, some policies in Texas aren't great, but overall, they are still much better than California. That being said,  I wish Texas would legalize marijuana. I don't smoke, I just think it's a dumb thing to outlaw. But that could just be the Californian in me.

Which is why you see the attitudes that you dislike so much. I'm not worried. It's a self correcting problem. If enough politically like-minded people move here to facilitate any real change, they will simply get what they asked for. Then they will have to move to another state to find work. I just hope Blue Belle doesn't go out of business in the process.

permalinksaveparent[+]HoratioBrembley 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago* (32 children)[–]HoratioBrembley 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago*Spending more money does not equate to better education.  It simply pours more money into an industry whose unions donate to Democrats.  So her platitudes belie the more insidious systemic thievery involved in taking more tax money from citizens and funneling it to public sector unions who are accountable to no one and who financially support her.

This is the page to change what the table shows
That seems to say that we are the second best at teaching hispanics mathematics and that we are tied for best state at teaching whites. At least in 2011 and on that metric. We are in the ten for both ethnicities(is this not a word?) in science too. Both at 8th grade level.
I feel like unless you are comparing us to California you need to take ethnicity into account, since we are a plurality in that regard, and most education metrics don't favor people who are not non-Hispanic whites.
Edit: I looked for a chart for SAT scores by subject, race, and state, but couldn't find one. If you know of one I'd love to see it.

permalinksaveparent[+]ConorKenny 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago  (1 child)[–]ConorKenny 5 points6 points7 points 2 days agoYes, when a special class of people or companies get a tax rate or break that no one else gets, and that further this tax break in no way services the original purpose of that tax break and is instead due to political influence, yes, I think that's propping up an industry.
If Obama gave me a tax break because I'm liberal I bet you'd be pretty pissed off about that, because we have an idea that no one should get special treatment in taxes unless there's a good, articulable reason. The high cost gas exemption was started for a legitimate reason. It was quietly made permanent for no reason at all. Really, unless you work for a natural gas company, you should also be pissed about this. Because if they didn't get that tax break, we'd be pulling in about $1 billion more and your taxes could be lower and/or we could start paying off the $18 billion in transportation debt  held by the state government.

I'll agree with you there.  Everyone should have their money stolen from them by the government at the same rate.  So if they're paying less, shame on them and equitably make it the same rate that everyone pays.

What GeeknDestr0y listed are lobbying groups, and they don't have any more power than the money they can spend, which is a good deal less than the oil/gas lobby, meat lobby, etc.

permalinksave[+]excoriatorgot here fast 8 points9 points10 points 2 days ago  (9 children)[–]excoriatorgot here fast 8 points9 points10 points 2 days agoThe Republican comptroller is the reason we all have to pay taxes on our Amazon purchases. What else you got?

permalinksaveparent[+]Unwanted_Commentaryborn and bred -5 points-4 points-3 points 2 days ago  (4 children)[–]Unwanted_Commentaryborn and bred -5 points-4 points-3 points 2 days agoYeah and he blows just as much as she does.   Nothing you said refuted my statement.  

permalinksaveparent[+]excoriatorgot here fast 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago  (3 children)[–]excoriatorgot here fast 5 points6 points7 points 2 days agoYou implied that Dems are the only ones trying to raise taxes on the Internet. The bill you cited didn't pass and took no money from anyone. The example I cited is a tax, implemented by a Republican, that is taking money out of Texans' pockets every time we make a purchase at Amazon. IOW, Republicans are already taxing the Internet and costing us money. Which is the greater evil?
Even if Wendy wins, she'd still have to get taxes past two Republican houses of the legislature. I don't think your argument against electing her is much of a hazard.

My point is that Wendy Davis is a thieving thundercunt and shouldn't be hailed as a demigod.

permalinksaveparent[+]Ace4994 -2 points-1 points0 points 2 days ago  (3 children)[–]Ace4994 -2 points-1 points0 points 2 days agoAnd why shouldn't we? It gives amazon an unfair advantage over brick and mortar stores. It was ridiculous to begin with. 

permalinksaveparent[+]excoriatorgot here fast 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago  (2 children)[–]excoriatorgot here fast 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoThat's beside the point. Republicans crow about being the party of lower taxes and yet here's one that's taxing citizens in a way they weren't being taxed before. Tax the business directly if they're not paying enough. Don't tax the customers.

permalinksaveparent[+]Ace4994 -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days ago  (1 child)[–]Ace4994 -3 points-2 points-1 points 2 days agoI don't mean this to be condescending but it seems that you don't understand simple economics. 
First of all, I'd argue that it was more like closing a loophole of what should have been a tax, than imposing a new one. You can argue otherwise, I know. 
Secondly, "don't tax the consumers, tax the business"? In case you weren't aware, that would have the effect of simply driving up the cost of the good by the new tax, plain and simple. Nothing else to it. 
Finally, however, this would have the effect of increasing the price of all of that good sold, not just the good on Amazon. You'd be further deterring people from shopping in brick and mortar stores. Many people, such as the elderly, don't care to shop on amazon, or even know how. Hell, my grandmother doesn't even have a computer or internet access. Why should she pay more?  

permalinksaveparent[+]excoriatorgot here fast 3 points4 points5 points 2 days ago  (0 children)[–]excoriatorgot here fast 3 points4 points5 points 2 days agoHonestly, I get why the tax is there and although I'm annoyed by it as an avid Amazon shopper, I'm not completely opposed to it. But I do believe it's hypocritical how doggedly a Republican pursued it, to the point that it caused Amazon to close down a distribution center in the state and eliminate jobs for about a year until the settlement forced them to return. You'll never hear Rick Perry or Greg Abbott braying about this one. 
Surely, you'll agree that most people don't pay enough attention to the news to know the background and to them it's a new tax they didn't have to pay before.
