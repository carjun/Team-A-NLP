This music video documents the production of the song "Change" by Maison Vague. The footage is drawn entirely from the actual sessions, along with images of some of the equipment used in the production. The song is built on a relentless Jupiter-4 arpeggiated bass line, triggered by a CR-8000 drum machine, modified with individual mono outputs, synced to Pro Tools via an MSQ-100 MIDI sequencer. As the Jupiter-4 has no MIDI, this was the only way to keep things *somewhat* in sync during overdubs.  Although the OB-Xa features prominently in the video, the majority of the synth sounds in this song come from the Jupiter-4.changeyesI must confesswe have seen better timesthan thishowcould we allowourselves to slip intoindifference?waitit's not too lateto find a better waythan thischangethough it be strangecould bring us back againtogetherwhydo we not try?at least it can't get worsethan thischangethough it be strangecould bring us back againtogetherWords & Music by Clark StiefelCopyright 2008 All rights reserved.
