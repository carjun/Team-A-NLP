Is this the kind of person we feel represents Texas and Texans?

permalinksaveparent[+]firex726 8 points9 points10 points 6 hours ago  (0 children)[–]firex726 8 points9 points10 points 6 hours agoWell technically since it's an elected position, he does represent us Texans. 

permalinksaveparent[+]meghatron500born and bred 2 points3 points4 points 7 hours ago  (4 children)[–]meghatron500born and bred 2 points3 points4 points 7 hours agoI can't figure out why anyone still thinks voter fraud is a viable argument to use in anything. It's generally accepted to be a non-issue. Why do some republicans still use it to push their agendas? Are there some people who don't know that voter fraud is almost totally obsolete now? Not trying to argue with anyone or whatever, but I'm just trying to understand why this is still something public figures talk about. 

permalinksave[+]le_end 12 points13 points14 points 5 hours ago  (1 child)[–]le_end 12 points13 points14 points 5 hours agoI can tell you exactly why (as I grew up on the right, listening to the right).
It fulfills their welfare queen / illegal immigration fantasy.  Somewhere out there dirty immigrants are illegally voting and getting free shit, with your tax money friend.
This is a BIG narritive on the Right.  Listening to my friends who are against health care and this is something they keep on bringing up.  Well I don't want to pay for some illegal/lazy minority who's taking advantage of the system.
THIS is why rich people fancy themselves victims.  I'm up here working hard making on this money and Juan is making babies doing nothing living the good life on welfare.
100% how they think, what they preach, and the kind of statements they make.  This has been repeated endlessly on right talk radio for over a decade.  End. Less. Ly.
The only welfare the right cares about is welfare for poor people.  They barely give a fuck that billions gets lost to corporations.  And I'm not talking about the bail outs.  Well I mean why shouldnt exon get a tax break?  They provide so many jobs..

I have such a hard time seeing things from the right sometime, which is actually really funny because I live in the Panhandle where that's about all anyone is. I guess I did a good job of letting it go in one ear and out the other!

permalinksaveparent[+]scurvebeard 4 points5 points6 points 6 hours ago  (1 child)[–]scurvebeard 4 points5 points6 points 6 hours agoIt's an excuse to revise election protocol in order to squeeze out unfavorable voters.
Politicians in Pennsylvania very nearly admit to as much.

permalinksaveparent[+]kat_fud 2 points3 points4 points 6 hours ago  (0 children)[–]kat_fud 2 points3 points4 points 6 hours agoI have a feeling that these tactics are going to boomerang on them. Republicans depend heavily on votes from poor whites and the elderly, two groups that will be hurt by the voter suppression laws.
