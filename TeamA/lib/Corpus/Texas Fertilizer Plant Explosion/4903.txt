Politics
Former Sen. Bob Dole reflects on politics, past and present
The 89-year-old former U.S. senator from Kansas speaks slowly these days, but the intellect and dry wit of the man who led the Republican Party in the Senate for 11 years remain. He is sharply critical of todays Washington, where little gets done. And he says the GOP is losing ground and needs to learn that compromise is not a bad word.

Teen Rapture: An author revisits his strict religious KC upbringing
Rapture Practice is not exactly a tribute to Aaron Hartzlers fundamentalist Christian parents. Its more along the lines of one of those I survived my wacky family tell-alls, although Hartzler takes care not to lampoon his folks. Amazon is featuring the book this month as a best teen book.


DEAR ABBY
Let teen ask his dad to events
DEAR ABBY: My 14-year-old son, Nils, recently joined a sport he really enjoys. His stepdad and I are at every practice, helping the coaches and coaching my son along. Nils recently commented to me that he would like it if his father could come and see him practice. I took it upon myself, as I usually do, to call my ex, John, and suggest he make an appearance because it would make our son happy.

TV review
Sundance Channel miniseries Rectify hums with tension
Eccentric and stoic after 19 years in solitary confinement, Daniel Holden has no option but to return to the hometown that demonized him for raping and killing a teenage girl. Rectify, the anticipated miniseries from Breaking Bads team of producers, is a work of fiction. But its premise has been stubbornly asserting itself in our cultural consciousness.



THEATER REVIEW
Art, tradition clash in Unicorn’s ‘My Name is Asher Lev’
“My Name is Asher Lev,” an adaptation of the Chaim Potok novel now on stage at the Unicorn Theatre, is earnest, serious-minded, provocative and poignant. It also is filled with a sort of gooey emotionalism that obscures some of the play’s better qualities.
