 	Jason Reyes, Texas Department of Public Safety Sargent, said 14 people have been confirmed dead and 200 have been injured as a result of the fertilizer plant explosion in West on Wednesday night. 
	West is located roughly 20 miles North of Waco and has a population of roughly 2,800 people. 
	Governor Rick Perry said authorities are done with the search-and-rescue phase of their work, with the exception of one burned house, at a Friday afternoon press conference. 
	Officials at the press conference said estimates on the number of missing people are unclear, as many people have been displaced from their homes and may have been reported missing as a result of that. 
	Sargent William Patrick Swanton of the Waco Police Department said Thursday that 50-75 homes have been destroyed as a result of the explosion. 
	Officials at the Friday afternoon press conference said no more volunteers at needed at this time, but may be later, and monetary donations are needed and being accepted by the Red Cross and Salvation army. 
	Swift’s attic, a downtown Austin restaurant, will be accepting donations for West over the weekend and reccomends donations of canned goods, bottled water, hand sanitizers, clothing (especially for children), medical supplies and other essentials and comfort items. 
	Swift’s Attic is located at 315 Congress Avenue, Suite 200 and will be open Friday from 11 a.m. until 1 a.m., Saturday from 3 p.m. until 1 a.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. until 10 p.m.
