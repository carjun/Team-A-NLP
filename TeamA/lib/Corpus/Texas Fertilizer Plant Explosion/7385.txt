Welcome my friendsTo a show about to endBefore it's startedA tragedyA cup of tea gone coldA love dearly departedA compromiseA pack of liesNo one deniesYou must feel cheatedWe regret to inform youNo time to warn youIt's beyond our controlThere'll be no showYou planned for weeksYou dyed your hairPowdered your cheeksHired a limoAnd all for naughtYou are distraughtYou feel like jumpingFrom the windowYou stood in lineYou drank cheap wineTo pass the timeYou must feel cheatedWe regret to inform youNo time to warn youIt's beyond our controlThere'll be no showWhere do I go from here?You kindly askAlas! I cannot tell youBut there's a manI understandHe has insuranceHe can sell youTo late this timeBut when you signThe dotted lineYou won't feel cheatedWe regret to inform youNo time to warn youIt's beyond our controlThere'll be no showWords and Music by Clark Stiefel©2010 by Clark Stiefel / Maison Vague
