I believe I will go with the XR17 for this install. Had a tough time justifying the extra cash for the XL20i.

The company is actually well respected in this area. The install includes a new furnace and indoor unit. 
Only difference in price is the actual system outside and in just not sure if the XL20i is overkill. 
I'm in north Texas which means our humidity is horrid in the summer.

The issue isn't moving funds from one place to another, it's that we haven't got health care costs in general under control and will continue to chase the carrot regardless.

Our maintenance guy suggested that we actually turn down the heat on the water heater just a few "clicks" and it actually saved us a few bucks a month.

It really is amazing to see just how cheap some of these meds can be.  I've been comparing them to the list on the druginsight.com search and there are a ton that are significantly higher at locations (other than costco).
I've managed to only find a handful that were cheaper than the 2011 prices.  
I'm almost afraid to go through my medicine cabinet and see just how much money I could be saving per month.  Unfortunately as mentioned in another comment, my wife is a type 1 diabetic and we pay through the nose for her meds.

Some offer a discount card for cash pricing. 
My assumption is that this is most likely a way to avoid the wrath of the insurance companies.

I've travelled through this town countless times over the years. 
Small community of about 2500 with a popular stop called the Czech Bakery where you can get the best Kolaches known to man. 
Heartbreaking to see an entire community leveled in an instant. 
I live 1.5 hrs away and will check in the morning to find out what help I can offer.

"Total" refers to a total joint reconstruction.

He is definitely on the fast track to a total due to the destruction of his patellar tendon and anterior meniscus. Mal tracking of the patella in addition to the loss of a meniscus will cause a lot of issues even after rehab. 
The doc won't really know the full extent of damage until he attempts to repair the area. 
His patello-femoral joint will never be the same and eventually he will have to have a total for sure. 

permalinksavecontextfull comments (1403)Doctors of Reddit, what's the weirdest thing you've ever heard a patient say upon waking up from anesthesia?  by  bunchahippiesin  AskReddit[+]He_wont_post 1 point2 points3 points 6 months ago  (0 children)[–]He_wont_post 1 point2 points3 points 6 months agosorry, this has been archived and can no longer be voted onBeen working in the OR for 8 years. Have a lot of stories but to highlight a few:

Patient wakes up from surgery and begins to interrogate everyone in the OR. "Who are you!?!?" 
"Who was that?"
"Who is touching me?"
Then after they wheel him out into the hall...
"OMG who are all these people out here!?!?"
"Put me back in the room!!!"
During one of my first surgeries, the patient was given a sedative and local anesthesia so he decided to explain to me how a taxidermist stuffs a giraffe while being worked on. Fascinating stuff!
My all time favorite was another patient that was lightly sedated with a block during a total knee.  He wakes up during the procedure (common under light sedation, the block keeps him from feeling pain) and hears the doc pounding away in a metal rod that is seated in his tibia.
It was at this moment that he begins howling and screaming out loud, scaring the hell out of everyone in the room!
He follows it up with, "just kiddin doc, I can't feel a damn thing!!!"

The doc took a minute to compose himself before proceeding.
