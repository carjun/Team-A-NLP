I think this must be one of the first recordings I ever made. I can remember it being stormy outside, raining hard and blowing a gail (worrying combination when using analog gear lol!) and I had just finished watching Alien and The Fog. I fired up the P5 Rev 3.3 and recorded some sounds with the view of making some kinda filmscore. Well, I never got round to finishing it.....this clip was done within 20 mins and features some famous sounds. You may recognise the 'Whaling' sound featured on Star Trek 'The Voyage Home' and also the dark drone in 'Alien'. I programmed the rest of the sounds myself. Lovely, atmospheric synth - if you cant get hold of one of these get the new DSI Prophet 08 instead :D
