It's not okay for them to just make the rule and expect employees to take up the slack.  That's poor management, and it's illegal.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (28)Some questions from a fairly new cook about unpaid time/overtime.  by  xdkylehuin  KitchenConfidential[+]Cdresden 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Cdresden 2 points3 points4 points 2 hours agoI've heard about kitchens that encourage unpaid work, but I've never worked in them in 20+ years throughout the western US.  I've worked new jobs on a trial basis, but even that time was paid.  So in my experience, unpaid work is definitely not the norm, and you shouldn't put up with it.
Companies can get in lots of trouble for not paying employees for time worked.  Tell your chef you're willing to work hard and kick ass for every hour you're in the house, but you need to be paid for every hour of that time.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (2)Watching Peyton Manning at a (9)  by  Bmontbearin  trees[+]Cdresden 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours ago  (0 children)[–]Cdresden 0 points1 point2 points 4 hours agoMy dad and I used to love watching him.  Frequently, it would be fourth quarter, with the Colts down by 3 scores, and five minutes to go.  And the other team is scared shitless.  Because they know he can still win.  Then it's the 2:00 warning, and the colts are down by 2 scores, and Peyton goes back to work, and you see his face.......and he's having a good time!  That's when the other team knows they're truly fucked.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (6)Needing some tips on smoked pulled pork  by  LordBoobingtonin  smoking[+]Cdresden 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago* (0 children)[–]Cdresden 2 points3 points4 points 1 day ago*I like Alton, but I don't like that recipe.  210F is too low, in my opinion, for smoking an 8 lb. chunk of meat.  Honestly, I don't know if it would even get up to 210F inside a 210F smoker in 12 hours time.  I try for a smoke temp of 250-275F myself, but I wouldn't smoke pork butts at under 225F.  I shoot for a meat internal temp of about 195F, then I wrap and insulate in a cooler chest for an hour, and the temp peaks around 200-205F.  Perfect.
Lots of fun info at Amazing Ribs.
If I'm serving barbecued pork in a serve-yourself or buffet type setting, I pull it and serve as-is, and serve sauces on the side.  You can moisten it with some of the pan drippings if you like, but it shouldn't be swimming in the drippings.  Also, pulling pork doesn't mean you need to shred it into threads; people like chunks of meat, not felt.  The only time I'd dress the pork with barbecue sauce would be if I'm serving made sandwiches.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (25)Are the seeds inside dried chilies alive? Can I plant them?  by  ShamelessNudityin  HotPeppers[+]Cdresden 4 points5 points6 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Cdresden 4 points5 points6 points 1 day agoAbsolutely the seeds are alive.  They haven't been cooked, and they are likely less than a year old.  They're viable.
You can toast the chile seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat until golden brown, and then pulverize them in a spice grinder and use in cooking, add to dry rubs or spice mixes, etc.
Some Mexican moles use toasted chile seeds as a flavor and thickening agent.  Mole negro toasts the seeds until blackened.  But that's a very complicated recipe...

It has more texture.  Surprisingly, it's actually not that bitter.  The flavor of darkly toasted or grilled bread matches well with meat.  We're not making breakfast toast here.

I've managed kitchens for years.  I don't care what people do after work, but my policy is that people need to wait until they clock off.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (38)Had a Go at a Spaghetti and Meatball Sandwich  by  Scrennscrandleyin  eatsandwiches[+]Cdresden 1 point2 points3 points 1 day ago  (0 children)[–]Cdresden 1 point2 points3 points 1 day agoI support your meatball sandwich, and hope you post more of your projects in the future.  However, I think you've got room for improvement here.  I think the pasta should be dressed in sauce, or at least tossed with butter, salt, pepper and parsley.  And I think the sandwich should be toasted/broiled open face, then the two halves slapped together.
I think with a meatball sandwich, the ingredients need to be a little more seasoned than normal, or they taste a bit bland.  The sauce you use can be more heavily seasoned than a regular marinara.
