Lyrics:Our own correspondent is sorry to tell,Of an uneasy time that all is not well,On the borders there's movement,In the hills there is trouble,Food is short, crime is double.Prices have risen since the government fell,Casualties increase as the enemy shell,The climate's unhealthy,flies and rats thrive,And sooner or later the end will arrive,This is your correspondant, running out of tapeGunfire's increasing, looting, burning, rape
