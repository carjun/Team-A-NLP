To run this program, run the shell script: 
	./Unit1 

If interested in examining in running the solution individually, then just add the flag
	./Unit1 -1b1

If you want to put the solution for the python script into a text file, the output will be put in a folder called “output”. Type this command: 
	./Unit1 -f 

If you need help then type this command
	./Unit1 -help

Happy examining our solutions

Some of the python scripts might be in a library outside of Unit1. We made this library so that we decrease rewriting our solutions
