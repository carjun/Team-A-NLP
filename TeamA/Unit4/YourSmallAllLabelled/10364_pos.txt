The remains of an apartment complex in West, a small town in the center of Texas devastated by an explosion on Wednesday.                            Sgt. Jason Reyes of the Texas Department of Public Safety said that about 200 people were injured and that at least 50 homes were damaged by the explosion, which was caused by a fire inside the plant on Wednesday evening. The plant is surrounded by houses, a 50-unit apartment complex, three schools and a nursing home.        On Friday, President Obama issued an emergency declaration for Texas, allowing the state to obtain federal assistance to help pay for the recovery.        Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the United States Chemical Safety Board and other federal agencies swarmed the remains of the plant on Friday. They focused on a pair of reinforced steel tanks that stored anhydrous ammonia, an inexpensive liquid fertilizer commonly used across rural America. Under some conditions, it can turn into flammable gas.        Last summer, the United States Pipeline and Hazardous Material Administration fined the plant, a retail and warehouse facility for grains and fertilizer, $10,000 for safety violations, citing inadequate markings on the tanks and deficient transportation plans for the fertilizer. Farmers hauled it away from the plant in tanks pegged to the backs of their pickup trucks. The fine was settled for $5,250, according to agency records.        The investigation, Sergeant Reyes said, will most likely continue for at least several days.        All but one of the 127 nursing home residents survived the fire and explosion, aided in their escape by friends, relatives, strangers and rescue workers who responded.        Dr. Smith said nursing home workers had a well-rehearsed evacuation plan in case of a fire at the plant: they shut off the air-conditioning system, placed wet towels under doors to keep out the fumes and called school buses to come pick up the residents.        Many people displaced by the explosion took shelter not at the community center, where cots had been set up for them, but at the homes of friends and family.        West lost three of its four school buildings in the explosion, which also damaged about 20 school buses, the entire fleet. On Friday, trucks lined up outside the one surviving campus, of the West Elementary School, bringing in chairs, portable classrooms and supplies. Classes are expected to resume on Monday.
