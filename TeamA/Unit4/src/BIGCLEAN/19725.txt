And that's where david kerley has the details. Good morning, david. Reporter: Good morning, george. Just a week ago, a little more than that, united finally started its flight from denver to tokyo. But this morning, the 787 dreamliner is on the ground, here in seattle, plagued by another problem. This jet had to turn around. United 139 heavy. Reporter: The brand-new plane on a brand-new route had just reached the pacific ocean off vancouver island when something happened to one of its oil filters on one of its engines. Cleared to land. Reporter: The dreamliner landed without incident. But this is another nightmare for boeing's plane of the future. There were the two burning batteries that grounded the entire fleet for the first part of the year. Just a month ago with some fanfare. This is a wonderful aircraft. Reporter: The 787 returned to the sky. We had to postpone this. Reporter: Abc news was on that flight. Good morning. Reporter: With the ceo of united, who is banking part of his airline's future on the 787. We want to fly this plane. If we're going to sit on the ground, like a sculpture, it's like having a brand-new sports car and you're not allowed to drive it. Reporter: But this morning, this jet can't be driven nor flown. Now, an aviation expert tells us, this really isn't a 787 problem as much as on engine problem. It's a new g.E. Engine. It's an oil filter. No word on when this particular 787 is going to return to flight.
