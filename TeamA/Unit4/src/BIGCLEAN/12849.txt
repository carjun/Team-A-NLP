['    October 7: Robert Gibbs, Newt Gingrich, Hilary Rosen, Mike Murphy, Chuck Todd, Arnold Schwarzenegger', '        MR. TIM RUSSERT: Our issues this Sunday: Iraq. Will more U.S. troops stop the violence? Will the Iraqis ever be able to secure their own country? And what kind of country will the U.S. eventually leave behind?', 'With us, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York; Republican Senator David Vitter of Louisiana; former Bush speechwriter, now with the Council on Foreign Relations, Michael Gerson; and former Clinton foreign policy adviser, now with the Brookings Institution, Ken Pollack.', 'GOV. HUCKABEE: I think America needs positive, optimistic leadership to kind of turn this country around, to see a revival of our national soul, and to reclaim a sense of, of the greatness of this country that we love, and also to help bring people together to find a practical solution to a lot of the issues that people really worry about when they sit around the dinner table and talk at night.', 'MR. RUSSERT: If you were in the Senate or the House, would you vote to oppose the president sending more troops to Iraq?', 'MR. RUSSERT: You were governor of Arkansas for 10 years plus. The Cato Institute, conservative think tank...', 'MR. RUSSERT: And if need be, because of the war in Iraq, because of the deficit, because of health care, because of infrastructure, would you keep raising federal taxes on the table?', 'MR. RUSSERT: But if you outlawed abortion, what would happen to the doctor who performed an abortion? What, what would happen to the woman who had an abortion?', 'GOV. HUCKABEE: I would seek always to promote the view that life is precious and should be protected. Would I be able to singularly do that? Of course not. But I think it has to be won on, on a battlefield of one heart at a time rather than pieces of legislation at a time.', 'I just completed a book in which I talk about the difference between horizontal politics, where everything is left or right, everything is liberal or conservative, everything is Democrat or Republican. I think the American people are hungry for vertical politics, where we have leaders who lift us up rather than those who tear us down.', 'GOV. HUCKABEE: So we ought to be working more to build strong families rather than just to create new versions of them.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Let me ask you about a controversial aspect of your governorship. Wayne Dumond...', 'MR. RUSSERT: But, in hindsight, you regret announcing that you were going to commute his sentence.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat, has announced for president, the former first lady of Arkansas.', 'MR.

RUSSERT: Senator Vitter, 68 soldiers from Louisiana have died in Iraq, 484...', 'MR. RUSSERT: ...484 have been wounded or injured. What would you say to the people of Louisiana today why more soldiers should be sent?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Well, the Iraq Study Group, you have the book in front of you, called for reaching out, and the president rejected it.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Can you continue to wage a war without the support of the American people?', 'MR. RUSSERT: If you believe the plan is such, such a flop, then why did you vote to confirm General Petraeus, who is one of the architects of the plan?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Michael Gerson, the logic of voting for General Petraeus but voting against the troop surge?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Ken Pollack, are you pessimistic? Do you believe there will be all-out civil war?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Does the president accept the fact that significant, major misjudgments were made?', 'President GEORGE W. BUSH: And tonight, I also offer this pledge of the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives. And all who question the future of the Crescent City need to know there is no way to imagine America without New Orleans, and this great city will rise again.', 'MR. RUSSERT: The State of the Union message this year, not one mention of Katrina.', 'SEN. SCHUMER: Not Iraq. I think we do have to discuss how to deal with the war on terror in the future. But I think that the president has shown so little veering from this plan, which is a disaster, that by 2000--early 2008, even he is going to be forced to withdraw troops from Iraq.', "        A Meet the Press roundtable looks back at the president's speech on Friday and how the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case impacts the American people."]
