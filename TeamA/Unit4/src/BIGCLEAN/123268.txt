["This aired on Dateline NBC on Friday, Dec. 18, 2009. The full video won't be online, but you can ", '        When a frigid New England winter refuses to loosen its grip, and slush weighs down the soul, there is an antidote waiting for the lucky few: the bathtub warm waters of the Caribbean.', 'Better still, slip into an azure sea and have a look around at an underwater world that divers say is like a parallel universe.', 'KeithRoyle: What they would do is sail around the area to the different islands, stop where they wish, do a dive or two and then move to a different island.', 'She liked to count fish underwater. He liked to photograph them. So what could go wrong? As it turned out, quite a lot. ', 'KeithRoyle: I heard an emergency call that there was a diving accident and they needed assistance.', 'Shelley--Shelley Tyre--was a bundle of energy, a five-feet-nothing tall teacher and school administrator. She was as vivacious as he was quiet.', 'Swain was known to his friends and customers as an honest businessman, and an active member of the community.', "And, likewise, the people in Shelley's circle raved about her. School parents like Colleen Tondorf.", 'Shelley -- who famously wore a bumble-bee costume to a school event once -- was seen as nothing less than a gift by the faculty and parents at Thayer Academy in suburban Boston where she was headmaster of the Middle School.', "And always by Shelley's side, constant companion Tori the Bernese Mountain Dog. Her furry comfort was always available to a pupil having a bad day.", 'Dennis Murphy, Dateline NBC Correspondent: And, of course, Tori is in the yearbook.', "Shelley and David married in 1993. They didn't have children together, but she quickly endeared herself to his two, a son and a daughter, from a previous marriage.", "Shelley became actively involved in David's dive shop -- planning the big expansion to add a pool so he could teach diving year round.", "The fly in the ointment was Shelley's weekday commute. The private school where she worked was a long slog from coastal Rhode Island. She was probably seeing more of Tori the dog than David her husband.", "If Shelley's life as a road-warrior was stressing the couple out, those who knew them reasonably well, like Marina owner Bill Munger, didn't see it.", "Spring break of 1999 would be Shelley and David's time to escape the grind and enjoy together what they loved best -- the water.", 'Dennis Murphy: So come spring break that year, she and her husband David are gonna go to the British Virgin Islands and dive.', 'But, of course, that trip -- that last dive -- would go so horribly wrong. How could anyone make sense of the deeply sad and mysterious death of Shelley Tyre?', 'Upon arrival here on Tortola, the men set about to arrange for their charter and the rental of their scuba gear. The women went shopping for provisions for their sailboat, called "The Caribbean Soul." Then the five motored out from this marina for their holiday at sea. To this day, no one in that group can say that anything was amiss.', 'David Swain says he and Shelley made their way together over the reef and across the open sand, to the Twin Wrecks dive site.', 'David Swain: I have a vague memory of swimming around it slowly and poking in the openings here and there.', 'David Swain: meandered over towards the reef area to see if there was something there to see. ', "David Swain: Have a vague recollection of circumnavigating the wrecks, poking around the wrecks, and seeing Shelley still interested in looking at something around there, and that's the last time I saw her, as I swam off towards the reef. ", 'David Swain: A gal in an environment, contented to be there, just as normal as ever. ', 'David Swain: I probably did a "Has anybody seen Shelley yet" and they probably said "No, not yet."', 'Interrogator: And were you then able to observe what about Shelley as you got even closer?', "Interrogator: When you got Shelley's body to the boat, you already thought she was dead?", 'BillMunger: Certainly if you went up and down the avenue here you would find, people on both sides of the issue. ', "But Swain did have one new alternative source of money -- he would collect more than $600,000 in life insurance and other assets of Shelley's.", "Jennifer Swain: You told us this story about Shelley's drowning. You were tearful, and angry.", "But it wasn't enough. David Swain was found responsible for Shelley Tyre's death. The jury awarded her parents $3.5 million.", 'RichardTyre: This is almost a miracle that this has happened. His attorney told me swain is confident, in a good mood, and anxious to get there, and get this process underway. ', "With everyone in place, David Swain himself was brought in, showing every bit how two years in a hot Tortola prison can age a man. You had to squint to see the onetime affable scuba instructor who'd pleaded Not Guilty.", "Dreams, he would argue, about money -- more than $600,000 -- and another woman in Swain's life.", 'Prosecutor: They have never, ever seen this strap broken like this during a dive, never, ever! ', "Swain's innocent version of the dive was the account he'd given in a sworn deposition for the wrongful death suit in 2003.", "David Swain: I have a vague recollection of circumnavigating the wrecks, poking around the wrecks, and seeing Shelley still interested in looking at something around there, and that's the last time I saw her, as I swam off towards the reef. ", "No way, countered Prosecutor Williams. It couldn't have happened as Swain said it did. And here's why, as laid out by scuba experts.", "The experts then said that given Swain's description of his dive, at eight minutes in, Swain would have been right where Shelley was -- right when she was drowning.", 'The Tortola jury was given what the prosecution regarded as an important fact, and it had to do with an agonizing lifestyle change that Shelley Tyre had made just before that spring break vacation. She was going to quit the job that she loved so much at the private school and take a job at another school. It was a school closer to her home, but it was also a job that paid a lot less money.', "And that was going to mean a big change in lifestyle for David Swain, the jurors heard. Shelley's income had been keeping the all-but-failing dive shop of David's afloat for years....but now Swain might have to put aside his life's great passion to start earning his keep.", "Why would Shelley make such a radical change? The prosecution said it had to do with Swain's second motive ", 'Most ominously, this one, dated five months before Shelley\'s death, which reads: "Life has definitely gotten more complicated ... I\'m wanting to be with you but I can\'t change this mess I\'ve got anytime soon."', 'Prosecutor Williams: Under the will, if she died, he recovered-- he benefitted from her entire estate.', "In fact, with Shelley gone, David would get the dive shop, the money and the girl. After Shelley's death, he collected more than $600,000 in life insurance and other payouts -- all of which he quickly spent on things like traveling and his shop. And just two months after his wife's death, he and Mary Basler started dating.", "Dennis Murphy: And in fact, they became a couple following Shelley Tyre's death.", 'Prosecutor Williams: yes, they dated for, I believe it was a year and a bit, and then she broke it off.', "Add it up, said the prosecutor, and you had a husband who wanted his wife's dive gear deep-sixed before a proper investigation. A husband who didn't really try to revive his wife. A husband who wanted her dead.", "But tides in the Caribbean, like everywhere else, run in and out. For the first time in ten years of rumors and lawsuits, a jury would hear a true defense from David Swain. And the prosecutor's account, that seemed as clear as a Virgin Island dive site, would become murky and clouded over.", 'Douglas showed the jury another letter Swain wrote to the "other woman," Mary Basler - telling her, "Our getting together actually saved my marriage." ', "First off -- maybe Shelley DID have a medical problem that caused her to drown ... we'll never know for sure, the defense said, because the autopsy conducted on her body hadn't been done thoroughly by an examiner who was familiar with scuba deaths. ", 'She did apparently suffer from TMJ, a condition of the jaw that can cause pain and sometimes even lockjaw, a grim prospect for a diver way down with a breathing device in-mouth.', "And it's not as far-fetched as you think. Just ask Betsy Dake, one of David Swain's many diver friends who closely followed his trial.", "The defense then read the jurors excerpts from Shelley's own dive log bookm there noting down the occasions when she'd lost it a bit to fear.", 'Hayden St. ClairDouglas: He knew the signs that he should look for, that he did look for those signs, and that he did come to the conclusion, unfortunately, that she died. ', "But what about the prosecution's claim that if you believe David Swain's description of his dive, he had to have been right there when Shelley was drowning, eight minutes after she entered the water. ", 'David Swain: A gal in an environment, contented to be there, just as normal as ever. ', 'But what about that other confounding find? That dive-fin wedged toe-first into the sand, its heel strap pulled back. Like a key clue at an aquatic crime scene, the prosecution had surmised that the fin was a clear sign of an attack.', 'The defense wondered about that theory - and Dateline tested it out, conducting our own experiment down at the Twin Wrecks site with the help of Tortola diver Keith Royle. ', "In other words, Royle says, someone must have put it there intentionally -- but who? The defense brought all the pieces together of what could very likely have happened on Shelley Tyre's final dive -- Number 355.", 'Next the jurors would hear from Swain himself. It was time for the man of few words to find his voice as never before.', 'Douglas: Mr. Swain, when you went on the dive with Shelley Tyre on that 12th of March of 1999, did you kill Shelley Tyre?', 'Douglas: Did you in any way during the course of that dive deprive Shelley Tyre of air?', "David Swain: The last thing in the world is I would deprive Shelley of anything, so I certainly didn't deprive her of air.", "Then, around lunchtime on the thirteenth day of trial, the seven-woman, two-man jury retired to the deliberation room to decide David Swain's fate. ", "Outside the courtroom, David Swain's children turned to leave, but then spoke to the cameras.", 'In the past few weeks, Swain\'s daughter Jennifer has launched what some might call a "thirteenth-hour" offensive to help her father\'s appeal. She\'s publicly revealed intensely personal details about her father\'s "troubled past" as a way to explain his cool demeanor: family secrets about his parents\' quarrelling and break-up ...and that his brother bludgeoned his mother to death. ', "David Swain disappeared from sight as he was placed inside a police van and driven back up the hill to the prison where -- failing an appeal -- he'll remain for decades to come.", 'There the smell of salt air will wash his cell, added punishment for this inmate who so loved the ocean. And now may never swim in it again.']
