TIM RUSSERT: Our issues this Sunday: A school, a nation mourn the deaths of 32 members of the Virginia Tech community. Students and teachers, sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, senselessly killed by this student, Seung-Hui Cho. What lessons can be learned from this horrific event about security at our schools, the diagnosis and treatment of students with mental illness, and the purchase of firearms?', 'With us, exclusive interviews with two members of the panel established by the governor of Virginia to review the tragedy: the chairman, retired Virginia state police superintendent Colonel Gerald Massengill; and the former secretary of homeland security, Tom Ridge; plus, the two Bush administration Cabinet secretaries who will conduct a nationwide review of the broader issues, the secretary of Health and Human Services, Michael Leavitt, and the secretary of education, Margaret Spellings.

On behalf of all of us, our deepest sympathies for all that has occurred, particularly to the families of those who have lost their loved ones.', 'MR. RUSSERT: As you well know, doctor, back in August of 2006, the very first day of class at Virginia Tech...', 'MR. RUSSERT: ...there was a gunman loose at Blacksburg, and the campus was shut down.', 'DR. STEGER: Well, in the first shooting that occurred, as soon as the police found a witness, we had a suspect identified who was pursued and taken into custody. I was advised that it looked like the event was contained to that dorm room, and we had a suspect being questioned at the moment, so we focused our energy on dealing with that particular incident. We had no way of anticipating what was yet to come in a matter of minutes.', 'MR. RUSSERT: In terms of campus alert, the University of Texas has a system where text messages are sent to every student, member and faculty immediately in case of a crisis.', 'In hindsight, looking back upon this, what could have been done differently, and what can be done differently in the future with troubled students?', 'MR. RUSSERT: On that terrible morning at 7:15, when the gunman went to the residence hall, is there any indication or evidence that he had any connection to his two victims?', 'MR. RUSSERT: And when he went to Norris Hall and killed 28 more people, is there any indication as to why he chose that particular hall?', 'MR. RUSSERT: What are the families of the victims saying to you, and the students on the campus, about this past week, the way the university handled it, and what we can learn for the future?', 'Colonel, you have been mandated by the governor of Virginia to look into this entire situation. Will you look into why there was not a shutdown of the campus immediately after the first shootings?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Governor Ridge, also about the reaction of the university to the presence of someone on its campus, in its dormitories with a very serious record of mental illness, will that be examined?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Two secretaries here, the secretary of health and human services, Michael Leavitt, Margaret Spellings, secretary of education. What mandate has the president given you?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Is there any thought being given to national standards for a warning system on a campus or at a school so that students and faculty can learn immediately of crisis or trouble and take the necessary steps?', 'MR. RUSSERT: If a student or a teacher observes bizarre behavior, at this moment, what should they do?', 'COL. MASSENGILL: Yes, I think a lot of people are, Tim. You never know how something like this is going to influence the people that are on the edge already, and, and certainly that is a concern.', 'COL. MASSENGILL: Well, Governor Kaine and I have talked about that, and, and we have not etched any timelines in stone. But we certainly are going to try to have something finished by the fall.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Will there be a written report for the president and for the American people?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Are you going to schools? Are you having town halls? How do you plan to...', 'MR. RUSSERT: Secretary Leavitt, any thought of looking into video games and the impact they may have on young children?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Will that cost money if schools upgrade their communications systems or have more security on their campuses or need more resources to train their teachers in recognizing the mental health shortcomings?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Have you heard from high school principals, superintendents in the last few days as to how, how they should navigate the situation?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Colonel, before we go, you will try to, to teach us all the lessons learned from this tragedy. But if mistakes were made, you will be willing to point them out?', 'MR. RUSSERT: We thank you all. A very important conversation with a very difficult subject, and we wish you the very best in your study.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Coming next, the future of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. The Democrats and the president continue to debate funding for the war in Iraq. And the Supreme Court weighs in on the abortion issue. Our political roundtable is next, right here on MEET THE PRESS.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Pete, a big decision in the Supreme Court about abortion rights. Explain it.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Jon Meacham, perhaps it was Virginia Tech and other issues that captured the news attention, but this decision by the Supreme Court was significant, and, yet again, the Democrats seem to have been relatively careful in their response to it.', 'MR. RUSSERT: Women who are in favor of abortion rights, and there are women who are opposed to abortion rights, as well, who are fearful on the other side...', 'MR. RUSSERT: ...that a Democratic president would change the balance of the court.', 'SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): You said something that struck me, that sometimes it just came down to these were not the right people at the right time. If I applied that standard to you, what would you say?', 'MR. RUSSERT: A Democrat got in some hot water with, with his fellow party members as well. Harry Reid, the leader of the Democrats, talked about the war in Iraq and the funding, and this is what he had to say.', 'MR. RUSSERT: David, is there any indication that the secretary of defense, or the secretary of state believe the war is lost?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Let me turn again, return to the Virginia Tech situation. Pete Williams, NBC received the manifesto from the shooter, and here it is, all gruesome pages of it. When you first saw this and read this, what was your first reaction?', 'MR. RUSSERT: Doris Kearns Goodwin, I had an opportunity to visit the campus recently, and I know you went there and addressed the students as well. Tell us about your memories of Virginia Tech.', "        A Meet the Press roundtable looks back at the president's speech on Friday and how the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case impacts the American people."]
