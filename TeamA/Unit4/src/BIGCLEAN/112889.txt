["An artist's conception shows linked-up Orion spacecraft during a manned mission to an asteroid.", "Now that the panel's members have released a report summarizing the options available to the White House, I have even more respect for their analysis.", "Next, it's going to be up to the Obama administration, and those deliberations will follow a logic I'm not familiar with. None of us really knows what criteria the White House will use to select NASA's future course, or how policymakers will mix and match among the options. In all my years of experience observing the Space Age, working within the heart of it, and writing and speaking widely about it, I've found that expecting rationality in the debate over space policy is often a folly that ends in tears.", 'I deeply respect the parade of "planetary partisans" who have argued for the moon next, or Mars next, or an asteroid next. Many are old, old friends of mine and I wish them all well. But whenever the answer comes before the logic, the argumentation is bound to be a little suspect.', 'So, suppose a strategy emerges that does not call for big-world surface footsteps anytime soon. Imagine astronauts flying up to another world, but not immediately descending down onto its surface.', 'NASA has already approved plans to fly a prototype VASIMR system (a.k.a. "Chang Drive") on the space station, but it won\'t be ready until after the end of the shuttle program, so as of now it doesn\'t have a ride. That will need to be fixed. ', 'Looking beyond low Earth orbit, the next-generation Orion spaceship, coupled with a large Saturn V-style booster, could fly out to higher orbits, to the region of the moon, to low orbits around the moon, and beyond the moon to a variety of gravitational balance points. ', "Closer to home, the moon should not be ignored. If Orion were to orbit the moon with with its astronaut crew, it needn't be a mere repeat of Apollo 8's flyaround in 1968. Lunar orbit could serve as a region for special operations conducted jointly with robotic systems on the lunar surface. There are places of high interest on the moon that are blocked from view from Earth by mountain ranges and other interference. Astronauts in lunar orbit could operate surface robots by remote control, looking for ice layers in polar craters.", 'Making the concept a reality in Earth orbit would be far beyond any credible near-term human capability. Not so at the moon. Its lower gravity and lack of atmosphere provide the perfect setting (and the perfect rationale) for a skyhook system that slowly spins as it orbits the moon, dipping its end near or onto the surface every two hours. The tether would have to be heavy, but it is well within the range of plausible space technology.', 'A "practical" concept for a lunar space elevator was described in Omni magazine by Bob Forward and Hans Moravec in 1981. Moravec expanded upon the idea in 1986, saying the skyhook system would offer "a fine alternative to rockets for getting supplies and personnel to and from the lunar surface."', "Such a system could be tested on a small scale at first, and then ramped up incrementally. That's the beauty of this Flexible Path approach: Each step in capabilities leads to the next step within reasonable reach. Giant leaps into the unknown are not called for. Decades-long projects aren't needed. Each new goal is well within the office term of the president who endorses it.", 'Orion spacecraft (perhaps, as proposed for safety, in pairs) can venture farther from Earth, eventually paying visits to passing asteroids. Accessible asteroid orbits tend to have very long synodic ("repeat opportunity") periods, so there\'s no time to launch a robotic probe and operate it for a few years before a crew arrives.', "Missions to asteroids could address three fundamental human motivations: curiosity, greed and fear. Scientifically, they are of tremendous value as records of the solar system's history. Materially, they may contain resources (water more valuable than metals) that could be economically exploited for space activities. And in practical terms, knowing how rigid asteroids are may be a matter of life and death someday, when one of them has to be nudged off a dangerous Earth-approaching path.", 'Mars has two very convenient "asteroids" right next door, its moons Phobos and Deimos. They would provide radiation and thermal shielding, material support (perhaps water) and a base of operations for human scientists to run robots in real time on the Martian surface. Beyond Earth, these locations may be the safest place for long-term stays anywhere else in the inner solar system.', 'Here, the presence of humans near Mars shows its value. With no radio signal travel time, remote operators could drive the rovers and run the sampling equipment in essentially real time. They could control fleets of small and large robots on the surface.', "The two Mars rovers currently in operation, Spirit and Opportunity, are mighty impressive. But even the rover team's chief scientist, Steven Squyres, has said that all their science and sampling and snooping around over the past five years at Mars could have been accomplished by a human field geologist in a week. Humans on Mars could move and decide a hundred times faster. But humans near Mars, combined with robots on Mars, offers the best of both worlds: safe access for the robots, plus fast human control from a few thousand miles away.", "These are all still imaginary missions. But here's the bottom line: by not getting trapped into replaying old strategies with admittedly better (but operationally unchanged) hardware, new paths made possible by more capable technologies and more informed imaginations could be much more attractive.", "It makes so much sense it's almost scary. It's so rational that its political prospects must be slim. So let's not strangle it in the crib.", "NBC News space analyst James Oberg spent 22 years at NASA's Johnson Space Center as a Mission Control operator and an orbital designer.", '        The riddle of the age of meteorites from Mars might now be solved, with researchers finding these rocks from the Red Planet might not be billions of years old as some studies have suggested.']
