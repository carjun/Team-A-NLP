['        President Barack Obama used the Port of Jacksonville as a backdrop for his latest economic policy speech, using an infrastructure project there to illustrate his call for greater investment in similar projects.', "    Boehner whacks King again, says comments make immigration progress 'more difficult'", "In the filing in U.S. District Court in Washington, lawyers for Armstrong said the Postal Service, which sponsored Armstrong's cycling team, got exactly what it bargained for, including tens of millions of dollars' worth of publicity, exposure to more than 30 million spectators at international cycling events, and hundreds of hours of television coverage", "The Justice Department this year joined former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis' whistle-blower lawsuit against the disgraced cyclist. Under the False Claims Act, whistle-blowers can share with the government in any recovery of money based upon their disclosures.", 'The government claims that Armstrong violated his contract with the Postal Service and was "unjustly enriched" while cheating to win the Tour de France. That came following Armstrong\'s admission in January to using performance-enhancing drugs after years of denials.', '"The government alleges that a single fact was hidden, and relies on that allegation to justify sitting on its claims for a decade: The Postal Service Cycling Team, like many other teams in the peloton, was doping," Armstrong\'s filing says. But Armstrong uses the government\'s own lawsuit to argue that the Postal Service should not have been in the dark. That lawsuit says that in the weeks preceding the 2000 agreement between the Postal Service and the cyclist\'s team, there were reports that French authorities had begun looking into allegations of doping by the team.', '"Although the government now pretends to be aggrieved by these allegations, its actions at the time are far more telling," Armstrong\'s lawyers write. "Did it immediately fire the Postal Service Team? Did it suspend the team pending an investigation? Did it refer the matter to its phalanx of lawyers and investigators at the Department of Justice for review? It did not. Rather than exercise its right to terminate the sponsorship agreement, it instead renewed its contract to sponsor the team."', 'That\'s because Armstrong had recently won the 2000 Tour de France, and the government "wanted a winner and all the publicity, exposure and acclaim that goes along with being his sponsor," the lawyers argued. "That was more than a decade ago. It is now far too late for the government to revisit its choice to reap the benefits of sponsorship rather than investigate allegations of doping."', 'The government also noted that the contract with the Postal Service required riders to follow the rules of cycling, which included bans on performance-enhancing drugs and methods. Armstrong now admits using steroids, blood boosters and other illegal performance-enhancing drugs and measures to win.', 'The lawsuit also named former team Armstrong team director Johan Bruyneel and team management company Tailwind Sports as defendants.', "In a brief filing Tuesday, Bruyneel also asked that the government's case be dismissed, saying he was making the same arguments as Armstrong.", ' Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
