She's 25 feet to the west of the bridge.", 'How surreal it was for Mac. When he got to the scene, he remembered back to what the psychic had said and was amazed that the area was so much as the psychic had described it.', 'Derek McLaughlin: One of the first things that popped into my head was-- when we first got out there, you know, the bridge ... The banks of the river ... The field of flowers.

Just shut up." The fact that he could stand out there knowing full well the last time, maybe the last time he was here, he\'s burying Cindy Zarzycki and he\'s walking around as though he doesn\'t have a care in the world.

They were doing it for the girl's father and for Mac.", "Derek McLaughlin: And that's somethin' that yeah, I shoulda never done. But I did. That's one thing a law enforcement person (laughter) shouldn't do is promise somebody that they're gonna get their deceased daughter back, you know.

If it was me, I'd want someone workin' the case, on my case, if I had a daughter that came up missing.", "A neighborly farmer came by with his front-end loader to pitch in.

It\'s a tibia bone to an adolescent child." And I says, "How do you know that?" he goes, "Well, one it-- I\'m an anthropologist." And two, he says, "The bone hasn\'t been fused yet." So, I said, "Okay." I says, "So it\'s not an animal bone."

He says, "I will not give up till we find Cindy."', "Derek McLaughlin: I still can't believe it. It was like-- we weren't supposed to find her that day. But, I tell ya-- she-- she was callin' to us.

We asked them if they could I.D. this and they -- nobody could.', "But Linda Bronson, one of Art Ream's ex-wives, said yes, she knew what it was.
