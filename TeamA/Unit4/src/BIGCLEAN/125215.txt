He was in a bad way and couldn't make a living", "Generosa even found him sleeping in his truck one morning outside her townhouse. He told her the drive back and forth to Long Island was too exhausting. Sleeping rough, it turned out, was the best move he could have made.

Because it's going to end in this courtroom here and now.", 'But in the absence of a witness or forensic proof of some kind, this was going to be a circumstantial case.', "The prosecution put on witness after witness testifying that Pelosi had blurted out his guilt to them: a contractor recalled Pelosi telling him he was going to bash Ted Ammon's brains in.

All had axes to grind.", "Then, rare for a murder case, Pelosi surprised the courtroom by taking the stand in his own defense, swearing that he was nowhere near East Hampton that night. He was in Manhattan until midnight, he said, and then drove to his sister's house, 40 miles away from the murder scene.", "Danny Pelosi: I have cell phone records and sites that prove the locations and whereabouts of me to a tee for Saturday night, October 20th through Sunday morning, October 21st. I arrived at my sister's house and I turned on the video screen to see what was going on out in East Hampton.", 'Gerald Shargel: A lot of the emphasis was on the timeline to prove that it was physically impossible for Danny Pelosi to have committed the crime.', 'Pelosi said he didn\'t do it but he did offer up a theory on who did or had it done. None other than his late wife, Generosa. He said she\'d asked him if he knew a hit man to kill Ammon, asking him if he\'d do the murder himself. Pelosi said he answered "no" to both. ', 'And in a case already sweaty with sexual treachery the defense offered one last theory of the crime.', "It told the court Ted Ammon was sexually conflicted, and on his last night had an encounter with an unknown man on the darkened beach by his house. An assailant, it alleged, who returned to Ammon's house with him and beat his brains out. The defense's support for that speculation was Ammon's final cell phone call to his girlfriend. ", "Sam Bruchey: It's 9:44, and what he tells her is that he had passed by a beach. He thinks it's a gay beach. He's seen a couple of men at the beach, and he's scared, so he's going home.", 'Phoebe Eaton: Then the question is, how could Ted Ammon not know it was a gay beach? This was a notorious gay beach in the Hamptons. What was he doing on a beach at 9:40 at night? Was he walking the dogs? Or was he in search of a tryst?', 'Gerald Shargel: So to encounter something like that and on the same night meet his death at the hands of others, seemed just too much of a coincidence. And I think that by itself raised reasonable doubt.', "And as if the case couldn't get anymore lurid, a male neighbor testified that he's quite certain that he had fleeting anonymous sex with Ammon in the bushes a few years before.", "Wagner: It was Ted Ammon I mean he wasn't introduced to me before. I had no idea who this man was that I was with, but when I saw his photograph in the newspaper I knew it was him.", "Michael Shnayerson: And no one who knew Ted Ammon well thought there was any likelihood that he's gay. He certainly has had a long history of enjoying women's company.", 'After eight weeks the case about staggering wealth matched by staggering treachery went to the jury.', 'If convicted of second-degree murder as charged, Pelosi could face 25 years to life in prison.', 'After three-days of deliberation, a jury of nine women and three men reached a verdict. Danny Pelosi was found guilty of the second-degree murder of Ted Ammon.', 'Kieran Crowley: He looked gut-punched. He really believed that he had done a great job on the stand, and he really believed that he was walking out of there.', "But he wasn't. He was going inside for a long time -- his sentence -- 25 years to life.", "It's been more than three-years since his conviction, but Pelosi still proclaims his innocence.", "Pelosi will tell you that bludgeoning someone to death wouldn't be his style at all.", 'But after his conviction, Pelosi implicated his buddy Christopher Parrino, the guy he went on a beer run with that night.', 'The next day, Danny says the two were on their way to Manhattan, and he claims he saw something in the truck his friend Parrino had been driving. It was nothing less than the digital video recorder that had been torn from the secret hiding place in the Ammon house. ', 'Danny Pelosi: I said, "That\'s-- what the **** are you doin\' with that?" I pull the truck over by a creek. I jump out of the truck, I walk over to Chris. I said, "Give me this ****in\' thing." I take the unit. And I wing it. From the passenger door.', 'If that story has a grain of truth, there went any video evidence of what happened in the house where Ted Ammon was killed.', 'As for the buddy, Christopher Parrino, he was charged with helping Danny cover up the crime. He pleaded guilty and struck a deal with the authorities. ', 'He admitted to driving Pelosi to Ted Ammon\'s house in the middle of the night. He claimed that Danny emerged from the house disheveled -- bloody. He told Parrino he "Had a fight with Ted... I think he\'s dead," he supposedly said.', 'Wife number 3.
