[' What sounded like a small explosion on Tuesday in a trash can at Disneyland in  California appears to have come from dry ice in a plastic bottle and may have  been a prank, police said. Walt Disney Co evacuated a section of the  theme park called Mickey\'s Toontown but allowed visitors to return within hours,  Anaheim police spokesman Sergeant Bob Dunn said. "What we found was  indicative of dry ice," Dunn said. He added that a plastic bottle believed to  have contained the material was located. "This afternoon, a small bang  was heard in a trash can at Mickey\'s Toontown," a spokeswoman for Disney said.  "In an abundance of caution, we evacuated Toontown to allow local authorities  the opportunity to investigate."']
