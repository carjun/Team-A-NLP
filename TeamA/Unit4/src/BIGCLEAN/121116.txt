"It doesn\'t work every time, but my philosophy is: If you don\'t ask, you don\'t get. And when you get, you can save hundreds of dollars."', 'Freeman gave me this personal example. When shopping for shoes, she told the salesperson she would buy three pairs if she could get a 15 percent discount. Not only did she get the deal on the shoes, but the salesperson gave her 15 percent off the blouse she was buying.', 'My friend Brian saved a ton of money on a new washer and dryer from Best Buy.
