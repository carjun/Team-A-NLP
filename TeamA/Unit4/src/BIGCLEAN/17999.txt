["President Obama's State of the Union Address - remarks as prepared for delivery. The State of the Union takes place at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 25, 2011 at 9:00 p.m. ET. ", 'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:', "It's no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years. The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs. And that's a good thing. That's what a robust democracy demands. That's what helps set us apart as a nation.", 'We are part of the American family. We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people; that we share common hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled.', "Now, by itself, this simple recognition won't usher in a new era of cooperation. What comes of this moment is up to us. What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow.", 'We are poised for progress. Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.', 'But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone. We measure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer. By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise. By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children.', "State of the Union 2011: Obama Calls for 'Sputnik Moment' on Innovation, InvestmentState of the Union: A One-Click GuideGiffords Could Be Released From ICUEconomy: The View From the HeartlandState of the Union: Our 'Sputnik Moment'State of the Union: Comedian in Chief", 'STEPHEN JAFFE/AFP/Getty ImagesFormer Congresswoman and Ambassador Lindy Boggs Dies at 97', 'The cast of the 1978 comedy film "Animal House."\'Animal House\' Cast: Where Are They Now?', "                                    Trayvon Martin's Mother Devastated to Hear Juror Say George Zimmerman 'Got Away With Murder"]
