['Chances are the contract you have with your credit card company gives it the right to change the terms of the deal at any time and for any reason with just 15 days written notice. That includes increasing your interest rate.', 'The credit card company would also be required to give you 45 days notice in writing that your rate was going to change. Then you would have three billing cycles to say no to the new terms. This would give you time to look for another card.', 'Many big banks recently eliminated universal default. But this is voluntary. Consumer groups want the practice banned. The bill before Congress does not go that far, but it would prohibit a new and higher universal default interest rate from applying to prior charges.', "The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights would prohibit charging interest on debt that is paid on time during a grace period, putting an end to double-cycling billing.", 'This bill would require credit card companies to mail billing statements at least 25 days in advance of the due date. The current minimum is 14 days.']
