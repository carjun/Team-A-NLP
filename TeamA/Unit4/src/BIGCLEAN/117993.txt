['Last week, ConsumerMan Herb Weisbaum was presented with the National Consumers League\'s highest honor, the annual Trumpeter award. The NCL awards this honor to people "who have not been afraid to raise their voices in support of social justice, a fairer marketplace and a safer workplace." You can read the citation by clicking here.', '        This is a tough time to be a consumer. That may sound like a strange thing to say. After all, we live in a consumer-driven economy. The marketplace is overflowing with an ever-expanding assortment of products and services. What could possibly be wrong? Plenty!', 'I receive a constant stream of complaints from MSNBC readers who are angered by shady business practices, upset by poor service and frustrated that no one seems to be looking out for them.', 'I sympathize with them. Customer service these days is often abysmal. Misleading advertising and deceptive sales practices are out of control. And the legislative agenda in Congress is set by lobbyists representing corporate America, not consumer groups working for you.', 'It is now common for food companies to use tricky wording on their packages to confuse shoppers, making a product appear to be more healthful than it really is.', 'The attitude at many companies today seems to be that helping a customer figure out how to use the product they just purchased is a waste of money. This is especially true with hi-tech companies, where tech support is generally rated as appalling. ', 'We also need to let our lawmakers (at both the state and federal level) know that consumer protection is important to us, and that we want them to commit the resources needed to fight fraud. For years, consumer protection agencies have had their budgets gutted in order to balance the budget. This is no longer acceptable. These government watchdogs need to get their bite back. They need to be staffed and funded to enforce the laws already on the books in order to punish companies that use unethical business practices. ']
