['Dan Binder shuffles through his paperwork that has been compiling for more than a year as he has been renegotiating with his housing mortgage holder, Wells Fargo, for a better mortgage payment.', '        After months of dead ends, rejections and runarounds from bank representatives, Dan Binder is still in loan modification limbo.', 'When Binder lost his job as a media researcher, he and his wife left their southern California home in July 2008 and relocated to North Carolina where he found a new job in the media business. ', "If all this sounds familiar, it's because homeowners around the country have been jumping through similar hoops with the same fruitless results.", 'Despite recent signs of a bottom in the housing market, the pace of foreclosures shows no signs of slowing.', 'More than 13 percent of homeowners with a mortgage are either behind on their payments or in foreclosure, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Thursday. As of June, more than 4 percent of all borrowers were in foreclosure and about 9 percent had missed at least one payment. A separate report found that more than 272,000 borrowers were at some stage of foreclosure in July, up 8 percent from June and 55 percent from July 2007, according to RealtyTrac, which maintains a national database of foreclosure filings.', 'The continuing rise in foreclosures delays any meaningful recovery in the U.S. economy, in part because housing typically leads the economy out of recession. Although there have been recent signs of life in home construction and housing sales, they have been weak and from extremely depressed levels. Every new foreclosed home increases the unsold inventory on the market and cuts into demand for new construction.', 'Falling home prices also destroy billions of dollars of consumer wealth as homeowners watch their home equity evaporate. That loss of consumer spending power creates another major headwind to any economic recovery.', 'The program pays incentives of several thousand dollars for each modified loan to mortgage servicers, which often are not the same as the lenders who hold the mortgage.', "Though many servicers had already increased staff to work on troubled loans, they've been overwhelmed by the volume of applications for affordable loans.", 'Servicers say they also have been frustrated by the tepid response to their efforts to reach out to homeowners at risk of default. The servicer representative who asked not to be identified said her company sent out one round of 45,000 packages to homeowners believed to be at risk; only 15 percent of them responded.', 'The Hope for Homeowners program, launched in July 2008, was expected to reach 400,000 distressed mortgage holders. At first the program was hampered by cumbersome terms and red tape, and only one homeowner got help. Terms were loosened in November without any meaningful impact. This month, the government announced it is rewriting the program again. ', 'The unchecked rise in foreclosures also is destroying the value of assets backed by mortgages that are held by banks and private investors. So far, most investors have refused to take that loss upfront and reduce the loan amounts for homeowners who owe more than their house is worth. Though most major lenders and servicers have signed on to the MHA program, the decision to make a loan more affordable or forgive some of the principal amount is entirely voluntary. ', "For whatever reason, voluntary efforts to modify loans have proceeded at a snail's pace. As of the end of July, only 9 percent of an eligible 2.7 million borrowers had seen their mortgages modified under the new program, ", '. Bank of America, for example, one of the largest holders of home mortgages, had modified only 4 percent of eligible borrowers as of last month. Some lenders had not modified a single loan.', 'That has raised question about the need for tougher measures to determine how aggressively servicers are working to modify loans.']
