From my point of view, safety is the most important factor you should consider. How did this vehicle perform in crash tests? And does it have the latest safety equipment? That would include Electronic Stability Control and state-of-the-art side air bags.', 'Electronic Stability Control, or ESC, uses computer sensors to monitor the motion of your car. If it detects that your vehicle is about go out of control it will automatically reduce the speed and brake individual wheels as needed. That lets you concentrate on steering.', 'A study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that ESC reduces your risk of dying in a single-vehicle crash by more than 50 percent and lowers the likelihood of a rollover accident by 80 percent.', "It's estimated that 10,000 fatal crashes would be prevented each year if every vehicle on the road had ESC. But this is still pretty new technology that comes standard on fewer than half the new models. It is an option on others. So if you want this important and revolutionary safety feature, you'll need to ask about it.", 'There are two types of side impact air bags. Some protect the chest and abdomen. Other, more advanced systems also cushion your head. Both are good, but those with head protection are better. ', 'The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety examined real life crashes and found that a vehicle with side air bags without head protection reduces your risk of dying in a side impact crash by 26 percent. With side bags that also offer head protection, your chances of being killed in that same type of crash drops by 37 percent.', "If you're buying a big, high-riding sport utility vehicle, you may think you don't need side bags. According to this study, you do. The devices save lives in both cars and SUVs.", "By the way, you don't have to buy a luxury vehicle to get side air bags with head protection. Side curtain air bags are standard on the 2007 Honda Fit. They're an option on the new Toyota Yaris. Both are subcompacts that sell for less than $20,000. ", 'Costco uses nitrogen to inflate tires. Is that hype or improvement? Is nitrogen really better than using normal air?', 'What do you think about the 30K, 60K and 100K suggested service for cars? I change my oil every 5,000 miles at the dealer. Do I still need to spend the money on these expensive suggested services?']
