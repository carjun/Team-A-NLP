["Page 10: 'This Week' Transcript: George W. Bush, Laura Bush, Mohamed Tawfik  - ABC News", "KARL:  OK so let's get to immigration because we have a big week coming up.  And you now seem to have a concessive of virtually the entire Republican establishment that the immigration bill should pass.  We heard from President Bush, Scott Walker weighed in on this.  Even Jan Brewer out in Arizona is in favor of the Senate bill.  But Rick, it's not going to fly in the House.", "KLEIN:  That's right.  The establishment and the House of Representatives are not on the same page on this, there's no question about it.  We all know the central question.  It's going to come down to Speaker Boehner.  Does he want to go against the will of his own conference in the interest of the greater good of the Republican Party and a policy interest?  And ultimately does he want to sacrifice his Speakership on this?  And there are a lot of issues that you can foresee John Boehner be willing to go down in flames over.  Immigration reform, it's hard to imagine that being on that list.", "ROBERTS:  And his argument would be, look, my main job is to hold on to the House of Representatives.  And the Republican establishment, whatever that is, does certainly want to hold on to the House of Representatives.  Without it, they would be powerless in Washington right now.  And so, Boehner's, if Boehner's calculations is, that the only way that you can do that is to sink this bill, if it has legalization in it, then that's what's going to happen.", "BRAZILE:  The Chamber of Commerce, the clergy, evangelicals and Majority Leader Cantor said that they're going to do a piecemeal approach.  They're going to look at what Homeland Security Committee and Judiciary Committee passed.  And try to come up with a bigger and better border security package.", "KARL:  But tell me, the White House doesn't sign a bill that doesn't have a path to citizenship.", "BRAZILE:  Absolutely.  And the Senate Democrats and the Republicans I mean, we have a bipartisan model that passed in the Senate that the House should take up.  But they're not.  What the Democrats in the House will do is go after 24 to 25 Republicans to see if they can get them to support a more moderate package and not the extreme package --", "WILL:  The number of Republicans who might lose their seats because they oppose this immigration bill is a vanishingly small, it's just not going to happen that way.  Furthermore, don't look at July, look at August.  Four Augusts ago, Congress was in the midst of another comprehensive reform, that time of health care.  The Republicans went home and the Democrats went and held town meetings and uproar broke out!  And when they go home this August, the Republicans are going to do their town hall meetings --", "ROBERTS:  I don't think July.  They're coming, they have a big conference on the 10th which is just in a couple of days.", "KARL:  So Cokie I want to move on to the extraordinary interview you had with First Ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush.  And I've got to say, these two really, genuinely seem to like each other.  Take a listen.", 'ROBERTS:  Tell us why, why was this important to you?  To come and have this conversation?', "ROBERTS:  Michelle Obama wanted to be there and have a conversation with Laura Bush.  She did not want to make a speech.  She could have taken over that conference that the Bush's had set up.  It was a First Ladies of Africa Summit.  And if she had come in and made a speech, she would have gotten all the headlines.", "And instead she wanted to have a conversation with Mrs. Bush and just talk about what it's like to be a First Lady and to exercise the power of the First Lady.  And it was very important to those women in Africa.  Because they feel strongly that often when somebody is out of office, that person goes to jail or gets shot.", 'ROBERTS:  And the notion of seeing these two women from different parties who had succeeded, one succeeded the other, be there together, be civil and be friendly, beyond civil, was a very important message to send.', "KARL:  Do you think we're going to see a more assertive Michelle Obama in the second term?", "ROBERTS:  Well I think she's been assertive in her own way.  You know, when they made that crack earlier about being put in boxes.  You know, that's true.  And everybody says, oh she's just doing these namby-pamby things.  What she's doing is very significant.", 'KARL:  All right thank you very much, Cokie, Rick, Donna, George, Rick, appreciate it.  Next up, the haunting legacy of a tiny island off the coast of Africa.', 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
