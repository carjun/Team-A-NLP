I have it on my wife's iPad and it works great, however this app is a little on the buggy side.  I have been attempting to watch Once Upon A Time and for no reason the app will leave the stream and go back to the home screen.  I have also had it crash out and start over when I am trying to back out of the player.I noticed that I don't get as clear a picture as I get on my wife's iPad, but that could be something with my Kindle Fire, or it could be within the app.I am hoping that the updates will come in a timely fashion to fix the crash.  I gave it three stars in the hopes it will be patched otherwise I would have given it only two.", "  I was excited to see this app available on Amazon.  After downloading it, the excitement ended. After trying to watch an episode of Grey's Anatomy I had to restart it 4 times. Twice it went back to the spot it cut off at, but twice it started all over. Not worth it until they fix this glitch. Time to delete.", '  I am glad to have this app for my kindle fire, but... the picture quality is horrible! I couldnt even watch the new greys anatomy because my eyes couldnt handle it... please address this issue!', "  I cannot understand why the inter-galactically large Disney empire (that owns ABC) cannot assign some paean to test an app like this on leading tablets (like the Kindle Fire HD) before they release it to the Appstore. The intent is good. The execution is awful. Image/ video quality is intolerable. The video streams break up into slow motion mosaics that make every show feel like an under water dream (or should I say nightmare) sequence.What a major disappointment! Most of the shows I like to watch are on ABC. Had to uninstall this immediately after testing several shows.Amazon is almost equally to blame for this fiasco... They are so blanking righteous about the fact that they 'curate' (aka, block out) lots of available content from the Kindle devices (read, they are afraid of a competitive market) to ensure high quality. If that is true, why did they let this barely functional, low performing app (on their Kindle Fire HD) through the screening process?", "  I play video on my Kindle Fire HD  all the time, and I don't have a problem: Netflix,Flixter, YouTube, even PBS, but this app only plays the commercials and takes FOREVER TO BUFFER.  Nice try. ABC, but not quite there yet.  I'll be happy to watch your sponsors, but only if my video actually plays.", '  I have not had the same problems with this app.  The player is easy to use and I enjoyed seeing shows I had missed without waiting.', "  When I first tried this app the commercials played fine but it continuously crashed playing actual programs.It's been quite a while now and when I decided to try it again it was like a completely different app. Works well, and worth keeping on my device now.", '  I was super excited to get this app and start watching episodes.  Unfortunately, the app will not play episodes.  It plays the commercials just like on a computer, but the the episode never plays.  I have tried to watch the episodes but shutting the kindle off and turning it back on, but it does the same thing.  Great app if you want to watch commercials and nothing else, cause that is all you get.', "  Soapnet channel on Brighthouse at night simply lets me know there are pixels crossing my tv screeen... but little else, so thought I'd try this route.

Read more', '  Shows stop midway through it. Would be great if you could fast forward through commercials. I have only watched one show that was complete. Needs some work.', '  This app was very buggy on both my Kindle and my Android phone.  I was only able to watch part of one episode before it froze up.

Could not get this to play on either one.  Wasted my time, my patience, and space on each piece of equipment.']
