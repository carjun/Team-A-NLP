['If the housing bill wins final passage the most optimistic forecasts suggest it would help only about 400,000 of the estimated 3 million homeowners who will likely lose their homes in the next year.', "        President Bush's decision to drop his opposition to a housing bill that has been pending in Congress for nearly a year cleared the way Wednesday for House approval of a greatly expanded package intended to shore up the shaky real estate market. ", 'But even the most optimistic forecasts suggest it would help only about 400,000 of the estimated 3 million homeowners who will likely lose their homes in the next year. And with home prices still falling in most parts of the country, some analysts and economists say it will take at least another year before the housing market hits bottom and begins to recover. ', 'The centerpiece of the proposed foreclosure relief effort is a package of federal loan guarantees to help strapped homeowners refinance into market-rate mortgages with better terms than the high-cost loans that are busting their household budgets. Lenders would have to agree to take a substantial loss on the existing loan. ', 'But attorneys, housing counselors and others working with strapped homeowners say the proposal falls short because it leaves the decision to modify a loan up to individual lenders or loan servicing companies. ', 'The option of refinancing loans at risk of default has been available to lenders since the housing and mortgage meltdown began. Despite government efforts to prod lenders to speed up the process, progress has been slow. ', 'The survey found that about 40 percent of the loans modified in the first half of 2007 were 90 or more days delinquent as of the end of March. ', 'Until now, the government had stopped short of explicitly promising to use taxpayer funds to back Freddie and Fannie. But as investors lost confidence in the two mortgage giants, the Bush administration was forced to step in and propose a rescue plan.', 'To spur home buying, the bill also extends tax credits of up to $7,500 for first-time homebuyers effective from April 9, 2008, to July 1, 2009. ', 'The debate over whether to rein in Fannie and Freddie has been under way for years, but the recent turmoil stepped up the pressure on Congress to act swiftly. Now, after years of languishing, the reform measures in the current housing bill have in some ways overshadowed the original intent of the bill, which was to help homeowners facing foreclosure. ', 'The new oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie could help maintain a ready supply of affordable mortgage financing for future home buyers. ', 'Unless foreclosures can be slowed, home prices will likley fall further, according to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. ', 'To help offset that pressure, the bill provides $4 billion in community development grants to help state and local housing agencies in hard hit areas buy and refurbish foreclosed homes, renting them out or reselling them. ', 'Opponents say using tax dollars to buy foreclosed homes amounts to a bailout for lenders; proponents argue that the funds would create new jobs and help stem the slide in home price where foreclosure rates are highest. ', 'A weakening economy, along with rising prices for food, energy and other household expenses, has expanded the pool of homeowners at risk of default. Some who might otherwise be able to keep up with their payments are falling behind as job loss or major health expense depletes their savings or retirement funds. ', 'For some homeowners, no amount of government help will head off a foreclosure. That includes many in states with the highest concentrations of mortgage defaults, such as California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada. In those states up to 40 percent of buyers in recent years were buying the homes as investments, according to Vitner. ']
