['        President Barack Obama used the Port of Jacksonville as a backdrop for his latest economic policy speech, using an infrastructure project there to illustrate his call for greater investment in similar projects.', "    Boehner whacks King again, says comments make immigration progress 'more difficult'", "Randi Weingarten told a gathering of her union's rank-and-file members that they should be more vigilant about their colleagues' abilities and said weak educators who don't make improvements only hurt the profession. The tough warning comes as state education chiefs have been trying to implement tougher standards for those in the classrooms and weed out teachers whose students aren't making progress.", '"If someone can\'t teach, after they\'ve been prepared and supported, they shouldn\'t be in our profession," Weingarten said to applause from more than 2,000 union members meeting here.', "Weingarten's speech was a broad assessment of teachers' role in improving not just schools but also their communities. Her remarks, at time resembling a sermon and at others a politically rally, challenged educators to reclaim the promise of public education and to oppose efforts to reduce its role.", 'Weingarten said too often teachers are left "to sink or swim" without help from more senior teachers or their schools\' leaders. She stressed new teachers should be mentored and offered more training if their college coursework was inadequate.', '"It recasts tenure as a guarantee of fairness and due process, not as an excuse for managers not to manage, and not to cloak incompetence," Weingarten said.', 'School reform advocates often point to teacher tenure as a roadblock to change.
