Three men who were all about the science. If anyone understood and ected the power of nature, it was tim samaras, his son, paul, and their colleague, carl young. They were tracking the ef-3 in el reno friday night. The area hammered by 165-mile-per-hour winds. Many of the storm chasers barely outrunning the twister. Tim and his team did not survive. Tim was found seat belted in his car, the others apparently pulled by the tornado from the car. Something doesn\'t make sense. He\'s always been controlled and safe. Reporter: Tim samaras was a pioneer, a world-record-holding chaser. To witness mother nature in that state is fantastic. Reporter: When I studied meteor r meteorology, I studied tim\'s work. At times, I have mixed feelings about chasing the storms. On one hand, they\'re incredibly beautiful. On the other hand, they can create dive stating damage that changes people\'s lives forever. Reporter: Inspired as a child by "the wizard of oz" he spent his adult life learning more. So this is it. He shared that sense of awe with me last summer. On a three-day trip studying his other love, lightning. Every one of the storms, i get excited. The little boy in me wants to come out and watch and stare. Reporter: He was one of the most brilliant men I have ever met. An engineer, a sky \'tis. No risk. No frills. Always wanted everyone to be safe. That\'s what all storm chasers will take there this. Our thoughts an prayers are with all of their families.
