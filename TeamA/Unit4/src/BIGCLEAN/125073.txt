They're not exactly the same, anymore, once they're here. But if that's so, can you ever really know a person?", 'Ah yes, a heart of gold. Your ability to know a man - know what he is or is not really capable of - is about to be challenged.', "So here he was, the respected educator, father, happily married man. And who'd have thought it given his beginnings, back in Bellport, Long Island.", 'But Vincent remembered childhood pal Donald Collier had a kind of pied piper popularity.', 'One of ten kids, his mother, Margaret, struggled and worried... But not about Vincent.', 'Margaret Brothers: Vincent was just blessed with the gift of knowledge. Cause he never had to study. But he took things serious. But I never saw him down or depressed or going through anything.', 'And then he met sweet, quiet Joanie Harper, from a modest but respected Bakersfield family. ', "Joan's mother Earnestine was an outspoken community activist who most recently had been working with the defendant in a high profile murder case. ", "Eddie Harper: My mother's main work-- was helping those defendants who were unjustly accused. She was fearless.", "Joanie had been a gifted athlete, a star basketball player. But her real passion, like Vincent's, was helping children.", 'And so Vincent and Joan became a team themselves, going above and beyond for the local kids, which did not go unnoticed around Bakersfield.', 'Kyoshi Tamono: He was known as the caring vice principal; the guy that really wanted to make sure his kids succeeded.', 'Kyoshi Tamono: And he was there with his wife in our stories, riding the brand new bikes and thanking the community for doing that for him. ', 'They fell out of love, they divorced, they fell in love again. They had a daughter, Lyndsey. Joanie, said her brother, worked very hard at this.', "Eddie Harper: Joanie wanted her children to have a father. She wanted it to be husband and wife. That was her main concern, that-- he was really involved in the children's life.", 'Eddie Harper: Seeing him-- change, watching him, how he was with the-- with the children, and-- and he was, in all intent and purpose, very good.', 'July 4th weekend, he took a break, flew east to Ohio to visit his brother Melvin. Joan stayed home to enjoy fireworks and barbecues with her mother and the children. ', 'It was Tuesday the 8th - Vincent still back east - a friend dropped by to see Joanie and the children. And what she found was horrifying.', "The news about what happened over the July 4th weekend at the Bakersfield home of Vincent Brothers and Joanie Harper was delivered in pieces, like shrapnel, to Joan's brother Eddie.", "Eddie Harper: My cousin's husband called me. And told me that Joanie-- and-- Lindsey had been shot and killed.", 'About two hours after he called me back and informed me that not only was Joanie and-- Lindsey-- killed, but my mother and Marcus were-- were also shot and killed.', 'He called me back the third time, and told me that they had found Marshall, and he, too, had been shot and killed.', 'Kyoshi Tamono: According to the detectives that interviewed him initially, he was crying, inconsolable, and at one point asked for a trash can.', 'Kyoshi Tamono: Because he was so sick to his stomach that he needed a trash can.', 'Still, as the husband, Vincent was, of course, an automatic suspect. At the request of Bakersfield police he was even arrested, briefly.', 'Kyoshi Tamono: People just came out in droves. For several days, it was a-- a shrine outside the home.', 'Margaret Brothers: The-- work that she was doing in the community that would automatic bring enemies, you know? I know my son had told me years ago-- that Miss Harper was very nervous and always had fear somebody was gonna break in her house. ', "No, police seemed to feel that Earnestine's contacts were a dead end. A year went by. The investigation cooled. And then, quite suddenly.... ", "Judge: You're charged with first count felony, murder. In the course of that murder, you used a firearm.", "Judge: Mr. Brothers, you're charged with criminal complaint, first count felony, murder. ", "Eddie Harper: We've never heard of him being violent with Joanie. We did learn that he had been with-- the mother of-- his first child.", "For a year, investigators had been quietly poking around in Vincent's past. They found a former girlfriend, Shann Kern. Once upon a time, years before he met Joan, the two had lived together when both were studying at Cal State Bakersfield.", 'Shann was the mother of his first daughter, Margaret, born in 1988. That year, Shann said, she filed charges against Vincent for assaulting her after she confronted him about one of his unexplained "disappearances."', 'Shann Kern: A complete different person than what you were really dealing with. And just had this most evil face. Scared the living life out of me. ', "Vincent spent several days in jail after that incident. There are two sides to every story, of course. Vincent continued to deny he'd attacked Shann. In fact he claimed there was a time when she came after him with a gun and a knife. But she was cleared of those charges.", "But one certain thread police were discovering was Vincent's penchant for other women.", 'Eddie Harper: During their marriage relationship, there were a number of women whom he-- had relationships with.', 'All but one of his affairs, it turned out, had occurred while he and Joanie were separated. Still, hard to dispute he was a womanizer.', "But of course, just because he cheated on his wife, it certainly doesn't mean he killed her and his mother in law and his three children. Besides, wasn't he thousands of miles away in Ohio the weekend of the murder? It didn't make any sense. Unless.... Unless he was in both places that long holiday weekend.", 'In the year since the murder, Bakersfield investigators had worked to piece together that very case. On Wednesday, July 2nd, Vincent Brothers flew from Bakersfield to Columbus, Ohio, rented a car, a Dodge Neon, and went to stay with his brother Melvin and his family.', 'Michael Gardina: What was compelling about the case is there was a total lack of physical evidence to tie Vincent Brothers to the crime scene.', 'And, said his lawyer, Vincent could offer solid evidence he had been in Ohio with his brother Melvin and his family the entire holiday weekend.', 'Michael Gardina: No. The fact that one brother would help out another brother, another family member, is not unusual. ', "Melvin and his family said Vincent was with them all weekend. However, after Friday, the family didn't actually see him again until Monday. ", "Michael Gardina: Well, he didn't disappear, he was with Troy on Saturday. Came back, left early in the morning, came back late.", "Troy was yet another of Vincent's siblings. Troy had come from New York to see Vincent. The two of them, according to Vincent, spent Saturday driving around to investigate universities for Vincent's graduate work. Unfortunately he had no receipts to prove it.", 'But he did have something, and that was the memory of an incident that occurred while he was in Columbus that Sunday.', 'Michael Gardina: On Sunday, two witnesses that were from this neighborhood had seen Vincent and seen his car.', 'A young boy on a bike had accidentally hit a car stopped at an intersection in Columbus. Nobody was hurt. No police report was filed.', "That kind of bolstered a feeling that Vincent Brothers was telling the truth-- or how he would know about this otherwise since it wasn't even reported", "But Vincent had even more proof he was in the Midwest, and not in California, when the murders happened. In the cellular age, no one goes untracked and a little of Mr. Yant's checking revealed that Vincent's phone records had already told their tale.", 'Martin Yant: It confirmed that there were some cell phone calls made from Columbus, when he would have had to have been in Bakersfield, or on his way to Bakersfield.', 'Certainly Bakersfield wanted answers. But how could that answer lie with a man who seemed to have solid proof that he had been thousands of miles away from the scene of the crime, a man the community had admired and trusted for over a decade?', 'Of course, the state had to have other proof. It had to be something else. Had to be.', 'We can only guess now at the terror in this house. Two women slaughtered, three little children, an infant, exterminated. Now, four years later, the state was finally ready to claim in court that Vincent brothers - popular educator, school vice principal, had driven across the country and back to obliterate his own family.', "Kyoshi Tamono: The motive even all the way down the road, after all the investigation, even the Prosecutor still wasn't entirely clear.", "Prosecutor Lisa Green contended Vincent was lying when he said he spent the entire fateful July weekend in the Midwest. Oh, the state agreed Vincent did arrive at Columbus Airport on Wednesday, July 2nd, here was the airport video proving it. But Vincent's rental car during that very weekend racked up enormous mileage: enough, in fact, for a trip to Bakersfield and back.", 'The prosecution then offered a truly creative piece of investigation direct from the land of CSI.', "Bug experts examined the grill of Vincent's rental car and found there scores of dead insects, mute evidence that told a remarkable and damning story.", 'Dr. Kimsey: We were asked to look at a radiator and an air filter to see what kind of insects we could find and-- and see if we could tell where they were from.The question was whether it had been in the western part of the country.', "In other words, the bugs the neon collected lived out west on the road to Bakersfield. And Vincent might have had time to make the round trip from Columbus, all the way out here and back again. But only if the state could impeach his alibi witnesses, his brother Melvin and family. In fact, said the prosecutor, Melvin had given several versions of his dealings with Vincent that weekend. First he'd waffled on the day Vincent gave him his credit card. Was he trying to cover for his brother?", 'Lisa Green: Were you lying when you told the detectives that your brother, Vincent Brothers, had given you the credit card on Monday, July 2?', 'Lisa Green: Were you lying when you told the detectives that your brother, Vincent Brothers, had given you the credit card on Sunday, July 3?', "Kyoshi Tamono: She painted him as-- as a liar, as somebody who couldn't be trusted, that his testimony couldn't be trusted.", 'The state even implied it was Melvin, not Vincent, who signed the credit card receipt for that Thursday night family dinner in Columbus.', 'Keith Morrison: Which would given him an extra day, assuming that Melvin is lying about his presence there.', 'Kyoshi Tamono: it would give him an extra day and more time to get across-- across the country.', "And if Vincent had given Melvin his credit card for an alibi, did he do the same thing with his cell phone, the one that seemed to prove Vincent's presence in the Midwest - far from the crime scene - all weekend? ", "Keith Morrison: So, if he'd given away his credit card, he could well have given away his cell phone also.", "It was clear the prosecution wanted to destroy any credibility Melvin had as an alibi witness. In fact, in different interviews over the years since the crime, Melvin said. He saw Vincent at his home sometime Saturday, then he said he saw him on Sunday. His story kept changing. And now, in court Melvin told the jury he didn't see Vincent from Friday night until late Monday.", 'Lisa Green: Would the truth be that you have no idea what time your brother got home?', "If Melvin had hoped to help his brother's case, that hope crashed to earth here under the prosecutor's withering questions. But where was the prosecution's proof that Vincent was actually in Bakersfield at any time during the weekend his family was murdered?", 'And the defense had something pretty interesting up its sleeve. The one man who could claim he was with Vincent, thousands of miles from the crime scene, when it mattered most.', 'Vincent Brothers was on trial for the savage slaughter of his wife, his mother-in-law, and his three youngest children. And prosecutor Lisa Green was holding nothing back.', "Lisa Green (to witness): So the Harper family would have gotten home around two o'clock?", 'Michael Gardina: The evidence will show that it was and it remains physically impossible for Vincent Brothers to have committed these crimes. Let me repeat that it was physically impossible for him to have committed those crimes. ', 'Keith Morrison: It\'s the stuff that makes you go, "Wait a minute, is this even possible?" ', 'Michael Gardina: So there can be many scenarios where bad mileage would be intentionally entered in the computer?', "And as for those specifically western insects the prosecution found splattered on the neon's grill? Those bugs, it turns out, have been found in the Midwest, too.", 'Michael Gardina: What circumstances would they-- they be found outside their areas of distribution?', "Police: Do I put a case on Melvin or do I use him as a witness? That's basically how this is going to work.", "Police: Oh no, right now, right now, right now, you know what you are. You know what you are right now? You're a suspect.", 'Michael Gardina: Did they want you to change your testimony from Friday to Thursday?', 'Michael Gardina: The police scared the hell out of him so he changed his story and backed off. ', "Det. Kruger: You don't want to go down with your brother, pal...cause there ain't nothing more serious than this, nothing, except maybe what Hitler did.", 'Michael Gardina: We had an expert analyze the video, and he concluded that the techniques that were used on this individual were so psychologically coercive that it-- it was the equivalent of using a rubber hose on an individual.', "Which meant it was quite a surprise when the prosecution suddenly put up a witness who told a completely different story about that little accident. In fact, said car dealer Tamba Lebbie, it wasn't Vincent who had the accident, it was him. ", "Tamba Lebbie: As soon as I started movin', this little-- boy came with his bicycle and hit me on-- on my side o-- of the car.", 'Quite a shock to the defense, given that Lebbie, before the trial began, actually talked to the defense investigator.', "Who to believe? Waiting just outside the courtroom was Vincent's ultimate alibi witness: his brother troy, who had already sworn the two of them spent the bulk of that murder weekend together thousands of miles away from the crime.", "Now was Troy's chance to come into the courtroom and tell his story. And then...", 'Kyoshi Tamono: Did not show up. He was actually in the courtroom at one point. We all saw him. But then there was a lunch break, and he was supposed to be called, and he never came back.', 'Michael Gardina: Troy was the only member of the family that did have a-- a felony record, and that // influenced our decision because we had put no one on the stand who had a felony record. ', 'Keith Morrison: So you put Troy on the stand, he gets impeached by the prosecution-- your whole case looks a little shaky.', 'If there is anything on this earth we can call true evil, then surely it would apply to vincent brothers, a man who slaughtered his whole family. If! If he did it.', 'Vincent Brothers (in tears): Joanie, Marques, Lyndsey and Marshall and Ms. Harper.', 'But where was he that dreadful weekend? He told the jury he was with his brother troy in Ohio on Saturday but the two of them went for a drive out of state to look at colleges and take in a basketball game. ', 'Over the years, thousands of people had put their trust in him as a school administrator, a champion of children.', 'So it went, back and forth. There had been over 100 witnesses. Now it was up to the jury.', 'Eddie Harper: We were happy that he had been justly tried and found guilty. We know we can close that chapter, who did it. We can close that chapter and move on.', "Prosecutor Lisa Green declined Dateline's requests for an interview, nor would she comment on the case. And without cooperation from the DA'S office, Bakersfield police also declined to talk to us.", 'For the murder of his family, Vincent Brothers was given the harshest sentence the law allows: death.', 'For just about everybody involved, it has been and will be a long, bad dream...a dream whose tangled roots might never be uncovered.']
