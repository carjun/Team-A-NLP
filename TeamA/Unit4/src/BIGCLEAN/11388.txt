['            Attack comes days after organization warned US urgently needs to improve cyberdefenses', 'Within a couple of days, in apparent retaliation, INSA\'s "secure" computer system was hacked and the entire 3,000-person membership posted on the Cryptome.org website under the heading "INSA Nest of Official and Corporate Spies," INSA President Ellen McCarthy confirmed.', 'Cryptome was an early forerunner of WikiLeaks, having been in operation since 1996 and openly advertising its willingness to publish national security secrets. The group states on its home page that it "welcomes documents for publication that are prohibited by governments worldwide." ', 'John Young, a New York architect and national security buff who runs Cryptome, said he had no reservations about publishing the INSA membership list. "We would love to name every spy that lives on Earth," he said in a telephone interview. ', 'But Young denied any involvement in the hacking of INSA\'s computers, insisting that the membership list arrived "over the transom" from a source he didn\'t know. He declined to elaborate.', 'The list of INSA members includes at least 95 individuals with email addresses from the supersecret National Security Agency, as well as scores of others in key positions at the White House, the Pentagon, FBI, CIA, the Office of Director of National Intelligence and the State Department. ', "Among the notables on the list are John Brennan, President Barack Obama's chief counterterrorism advisor; Aneesh Chopra, the White House's chief technology officer; James Clapper, director of national intelligence; Secretary of Energy Steven Chu; and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Also on the list is INSA's chair, Frances Fragos Townsend, who previously served as President George W. Bush's top homeland security adviser. ", 'Still, McCarthy made it clear her members were less than pleased with having their email addresses published on the Internet. "Intelligence people are not very fond of getting a lot of attention," she said.', 'McCarthy said the incident only calls attention to the underlying security issue that INSA was trying to warn about in its report last week.']
