See More ", '\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd great news here, where the big headline is, of course, that the royal baby\'s on the way. Prince william and kate, gearing up for their biggest roles yet. So, what kind of mom will kate be? Abc\'s bianna golodryga has the story. Reporter: For years, she\'s dazzled us with that gorgeous hair. That winning smile. Now, kate is preparing to wow us in the role of a lifetime, mother. It\'s something she first talked about on the day her engagement to prince william was announced. Family\'s very important to you? Yeah. It\'s very important to me. And, you know, I -- I hope will and I have a happy family ourselves. Reporter: Kate, say royal watchers, is considered to be a terrific mom. Consider the evidence. She has been a family-oriented young woman. She is going to want to emulate the childhood she had. Her mother worked from home. Picked her up from school. Very present in her life. Reporter: Further evidence she\'s ready for this role, is the domestic side, which has shown on trips to the grocery store, and in the presence of a new, royal puppy. One of the ways william and kate aren\'t that different from your average couple, is the fact they got a puppy. When you think of having children, you start with something more manageable. Reporter: And royal watchers say kate loves children. She showed that on her wedding day, enjoying her young attendants. And in recent months, happily spending time with children during royal engagements. She has been flexing some nestmaking muscle. Overseeing the plans at kensington palace. And the gardens is said to be an ideal place to raise a family. Motherhood is a daunting prospect for any young woman. But if anyone\'s ready, say royal watchers, it\'s kate. For "good morning america," bianna golodryga, abc news, new york. Thank you, bianna. More, now. We have at buckingham palace, royal historian and author of "the queen: A life in brief," robert lacey. Thank you for being with us. Thank you, lara. Let\'s talk about the timing of this royal heir. We thought we should be here a year ago. The tradition is, they knock them out quickly. The queen and diana had their first child within a year. We wondered why they were waiting. Now, it\'s clear. They didn\'t want to upstage the queen\'s jubilee. There were things that kate had to do this year, like go on tour and take malaria tablets, which wouldn\'t have worked. And as we saw, they have a new home, that\'s going to be ready for them in london, in april. That\'s key to the timing. We\'re so happy for them. And I hope the timing is correct. And as we\'ve seen on the show earlier, princess diana, clearly, has made a huge impact, not only on william, but on kate. Indeed. And william, of course, brought kate back into the picture in this kay. And going to kensington palace, they\'re going to be bringing up the new baby, where he was brought up. And I think in the same style. We might have a first with this baby? This is my prediction. You see, when charles was born, prince philip played squash at the palace. And when william was born, prince charles went off and played polo. I think we\'re going to see the first royal birth, where the father himself is present at the birth and sees the new child come into the world. A big occasion. And you have thoughts on names, robert? All of the betting shops are going mad. You can bet on camilla. You get 66-1 odds on that. Much more than likely is elizabeth. Also, francis, the name of the child\'s other grandmother. I think you can get odds on baby gaga, someone suggested. We are all having fun here. It\'s a great -- it\'s a time when even republicans, the anti-monarchists, are wishing the royal couple well. And they say, surely now is a time to give up the pomp and privilege, and make the child a truly ordinary child. What do we expect in the coming months? I think we will see an ordinary pregnancy. We see an open pregnancy. The sad details of what\'s happening to kate are not being hidden, as would have been the case in the past. And we\'re seeing the concern of a very modern husband, going to see her in hospital every day. A new day has dawned for the royal family. Robert lacey, we thank you so much for your insight.
