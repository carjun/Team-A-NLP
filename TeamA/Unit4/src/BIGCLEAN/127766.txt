What were they doing, do you think?", 'Cathy Pettiford: I think they were trying to put more liquid in to his system to get him sick.', "Investigator: OK, so finally on this day on April the 12th, you said he poured enough in it so that he couldn't get up and walk?", "Investigator: So they've been trying to do this for a period of time until it took effect, correct?", "Detectives: You want to tell me.

Which you should known from Chris's notes, they didn't get along and Chris thought it anyways and me knowing and I told him I didn't know nothing and I didn't want to bring it up cause everybody gonna think I did it anyway and I don't want nothing to do with it anyway.", 'Detectives: Did he tell, did he tell you, do you know how he got uh, Alan to the river?', "Rosalind Brown: No. He never did, he just told me.
