Good morning to both of you. Christiane, I would like to start with you. You had the last interview with the last egyptian president, hosni mubarak. They're taking great pains, the military, to say this isn't a coup. But it is, isn't it? This is going to be an argument for days to come, at least, as the u.S. Government figures out how to respond. Calling it a coup, not calling it a coup, and as the rest of the world does. You've seen the battle lines drawn in egypt. I interviewed morsi. He said to me he was going to be president for all egyptians. And this is the problem because they didn't believe he was. This is really the battle lines between secularism and religion. What the military's done is toppled an islamic president with an islamist constitution. And we'll see whether there is a political solution going forward. We don't know when the next elections are going to be held. Martha, I want to go to you for a moment. The obama administration has taken great pains to get a carefully-worded statement. They don't have influence over these events at this point, even though we have close ties with the military. They certainly have no influence over morsi at this time. But are watching it very closely. President obama put out a statement last night, as you said, very carefully worded. He said, we are deeply concerned by the decision of the egyptian armed forces to remove president morsi and suspend the egyptian constitution. I now call on the egyptian military to move quickly and responsibly to return authority to a democratically-elected civilian government. They want that to happen as soon as possible. As you said, they did not call it a military coup. There is a reason for that. That is a legal term. If there is actually a military coup, the united states would have to suspend its aid, its military aid to egypt. That's about $1.3 billion. So, at the heart of this is money. At the heart of this is money. Indeed, what's at stake for the united states? This is a key arab alley. The largest arab country on the heart of the suez canal, through which oil and vessels travel. It's massively influential. One in four arabs in that region live in egypt. We have a very close military relationship with egypt. It is absolutely a key partner. What happens there really does influence the rest of the region. Christiane we heard of the threats of violence from the muslim brotherhood. They said dying for the sake of god is more sublime than anything. What is the danger this could flip into an all-out civil war? With any luck it will not. People are talking about shedding blood, even the military, before they took over, saying they would shed their blood to maintain the integrity of egypt. This is part of what they're saying. We have to see if the military makes good on promising to have new election, rewriting the constitution and how long that will take. And crucially, whether out of this comes an opposition that can be a counterweight to the muslim brotherhood. We'll see what happens. It's very, very problematic that they've arrested so many people, the military and have closed down certain television stations. Really have to keep an eye on what the military does. It may not be a military coup but it's a military umpired solution right now. Who is in charge, the answer is, the military.
