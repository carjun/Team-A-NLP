['New Bayern Munich striker Mario Gotze is recovering well from his hamstring injury, according to the club\'s director of sport Matthias Sammer, but seems unlikely to make his debut in the opening game of the Bundesliga season.The 21-year-old picked up the problem during Borussia Dortmund\'s Champions League semifinal tie with Real Madrid in April, ruling him out of the final against his new employers Bayern.And the injury turned out to be worse than first feared, meaning he has yet to join his new teammates in full training.However, he has now been given the green light by club doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt to step up his training regime, and Sammer says things are progressing well."Mario\'s right on track," he told the Bild newspaper. "He is getting excellent care from Dr Muller-Wohlfahrt and our physios.
