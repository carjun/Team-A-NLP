["2011 SEASON IN REVIEW: In just his second-year as head coach of the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers, Willie Taggart has turned the team from Sun Belt cellar dweller to a legitimate conference contender.After winning just two games in 2010, the Hilltoppers 2011 campaign started off on a similar dour tone as they lost their first four tilts, including a 26-22 decision to Arkansas State in their Sun Belt opener.The squad responded to the poor start wonderfully by winning seven of its last eight games, including a pair of thrillers on the road at Middle Tennessee (36-33 in double OT) and ULM (31-28 in OT).
