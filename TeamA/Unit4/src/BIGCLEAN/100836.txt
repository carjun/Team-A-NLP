[' A.M. Ahad / AP After the collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh, above, that left more than 1,000 workers dead, retail giant Wal-Mart announced it would inspect all 279 factories with which it works and make public the results.  Wal-Mart Stores said on Tuesday that it would conduct in-depth safety  inspections at all 279 Bangladesh factories with which it works and publicly  release the names and inspection information, as pressure mounts on retailers to  ensure worker safety after April\'s deadly building collapse.Wal-Mart said it would also have Bureau Veritas provide fire safety training  for every worker in every factory in Bangladesh that produces its goods. Bureau  Veritas is a European testing and inspection company that, on behalf of  Wal-Mart, assesses factories and trains workers in Bangladesh.Wal-Mart, the world\'s largest retailer, began more rigorous inspections  earlier this year after more than 110 people were killed in a November 2012 fire  in a factory that was producing goods for Wal-Mart and other retailers.Wal-Mart said the inspections would be completed in the next six months and  that it would begin posting inspection results on June 1."Transparency is vital to make progress in improving factory conditions, and  by disclosing this information, government, workers, non-governmental agencies,  and companies can benefit from this work," Rajan Kamalanathan, Wal-Mart\'s vice  president of ethical sourcing, said in a statement.Wal-Mart has not yet said whether it would sign onto a Bangladesh fire and  building safety accord drawn up by labor groups including Europe\'s IndustriALL  and UNI Global Union and non-governmental organizations. Those groups have set a  May 15 deadline for retailers to sign on.Related: PhotoBlog: Bangladesh honors building collapse victims as search for bodies ends']
