The death of Princess Diana in 1997 had led to a dip in popularity amid accusations it was out of touch with modern Britain.', "But last year's celebrations of Queen Elizabeth's 60th year on the throne showed the affection with which she is held by most of the population, despite a small but vocal Republican movement.", 'The royal birth might also help raise the national mood, battered by economic problems, unemployment, cuts in public spending and a rising gap between rich and poor.', 'The festive atmosphere has been heightened by a heatwave and a string of British sporting victories in tennis, rugby, cricket and cycling.', 'Royal supporter Terry Hutt, 78, who has waited outside the hospital for 12 days, acknowledged his joy over the imminent arrival.', '"We\'ve got a lovely married couple and baby will make three and they will be a family.
