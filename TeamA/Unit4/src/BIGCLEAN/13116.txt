And it was full size and 2007. -- kids who brokered. If -- do -- -- -- words but no survivors or bodies have been found since last night tragically the youngest and most vulnerable were also the hardest hit.

Their school destroyed two so how did the children get out when so many of the students at plaza towers did not. It'll believes the reason the student survived it rare wood is because the school is constructed differently each grade organized into -- a few classrooms in each building.

Passing to children over the rubble. -- -- plaza towers a more traditional school building with a long -- of classrooms all under one roof.

It looked like and it'll bite my property here -- my neighborhood. Completely wiped off the -- Dallas pretty much wipe off the map we have a few pieces standing and our house some closets are standing so. -- theater some clothes we can salad cooler than that it's its definitely total.
