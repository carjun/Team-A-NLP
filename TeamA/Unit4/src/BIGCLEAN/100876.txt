[' Updated 12:53 p.m. EDT: Wal-Mart Stores Inc will no longer sell Amazon.com Inc\'s Kindle products, making it the second major chain to stop selling Amazon\'s devices, as the world\'s largest retailer makes a bet that consumers are more interested in other gadgets."We have recently made the business decision to not carry Amazon tablets and eReaders beyond our existing inventory and purchase commitments," Wal-Mart said in a memo sent to store managers dated Wednesday. "This includes all Amazon Kindle models current and recently announced."Reed Saxon / AP /  Wal-Mart will no longer be selling Amazon\'s Kindles, including its newer models such as the Kindle Fire HD (above) seen on introduction in Santa Monica, Calif., Thursday, Sept. 6, 2012.
