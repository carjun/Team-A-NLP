[" The Dutch government said Wednesday its main website is being hacked, and  also confirmed that a man suspected of participating in another major  cyberattack on Swiss-British anti-spam watchdog group Spamhaus has been  extradited from Spain to the Netherlands.The suspect, Sven Kamphuis, was arrested in Barcelona last month and  extradited Monday, Justice Ministry spokesman Paul van der Zanden said. Kamphuis  is currently before a judge in Rotterdam as prosecutors seek to have his  detention extended by 14 days, Van der Zanden said.He said Kamphuis, 35, is likely to face charges for directing large amounts  of data at Spamhaus in an attempt to derail its servers, and for breaking into  other people's computers.Van der Zanden could not confirm that there was any link between the Kamphuis  case and the coordinated attack on the government's website.Robert Wester, a spokesman for the national government, said in an emailed  response to questions that the attack began late Tuesday evening and got worse  Wednesday morning.The attack consisted of an unknown attacker or attackers trying to flood  government computer servers with so many requests that they would become  unreachable for regular traffic."]
