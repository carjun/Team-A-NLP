Now, are you ready to find out you why you shouldn't believe it--or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?", 'First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads generally refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced, most restricted ticket classes. What they\'re really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive ones. News flash! In some cases, they\'re giving absolutely no justifying support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances.', 'Here\'s the truth: Most leisure travelers never actually buy the highest-priced, most restricted tickets.

Searching a range of dates also gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on your airfare.', "Search often. Checking fares for your route frequently over a fixed period of time (e.g., once or twice per day over a week or two) gives you an in-depth, realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be. Then, when you see a price you like, you can book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.", 'Cheap flights, cheap tickets, and more at BookingBuddy.com.
