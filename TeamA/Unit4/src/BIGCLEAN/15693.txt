Good morning Dan wolf this case didn't start its front page news it started as a routine homicide that triggered a national debate about race but last night as the six jurors filed back into the courtroom exhausted after sixteen hours of deliberations. It wasn't about race it was about the law those jurors saying that the state did not provide enough evidence for them to convict Zimmerman of second degree murder. A moment seventeen months in the making. We the jury find George -- not guilty a flicker of a smile from George Zimmerman head -- with his attorneys the embrace of his family. Moments later a free man unfettered from that GPS ankle bracelet and he's million dollar bond you have no further business with court where that trial played out for 24 -- this wasn't -- Sometimes acrimonious days. Minutes after the verdict defense attorney Don west lashing out at the prosecution. I think the prosecution -- government -- it was disgraceful. And defending his first words in a trial not -- Who's there. George -- George Zimmerman who. All right good here on the jury. Saying afterwards I still think the joke was funny I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry I didn't tell it better. But there is an important reason for it -- needed to be a disconnect the prosecution's John Guy who played straight man to the more animated Bernie gallery and a now at throughout the trial implored the jury to think with their hearts I'm asking you you -- -- it's. -- -- -- He's -- I was real.

Now his attorney says that he's been also the target of death threats and even though he's a free man this morning.

Wonder if you've been predicting this outcome for days now walk us through why you think the jury ultimately reach this conclusion. Because it was a very finite question that they were answering and that is. Is there reasonable doubt that at the very moment George Zimmermann fired that gun. That he reasonably believed it. That great bodily injury was about to be inflicted on meaning that he was about to get punched or -- again. And there was a lot of evidence presented in this case. That trade on -- likely was beating George -- he had injuries there witnesses but some would say wait a second. But why can't trade on -- defend himself etc. Who what about who initiated this all of those are fair legitimate questions. But the legal question in this case was only what happened in George -- remains mind. In the moment before he fired that weapon as such a key point let me ask you about something -- defense said overnight one of the defense attorneys called the prosecution of George -- Quote on quote disgraceful. What do you make of that town. I don't think that's a useful comment this is a defense attorney who has just won a very significant case knowing how sensitive this cases. I don't care if you think that the prosecution was disgraceful I don't care leading this charge is never should have been brought in this case. There has got to be. A level of respect for the system I think on both sides of this and I was disappointed. We Don west common very quickly just have a couple of seconds where does this case go from here. I think it's over. I don't think there's going to be a serious federal investigation. I think that George Zimmermann is now going to live a very difficult. Life but I don't think that they're going to be any legal ramifications is likely to be able to. Get back is -- and move on with his life. Dan Abrams is providing excellent legal analysis throughout this case -- again.
