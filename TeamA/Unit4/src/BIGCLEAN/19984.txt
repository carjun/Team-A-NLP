["\t    Pam Howley talks about her daughter Daron's battle with a brain tumor and her decision to hold Daron's funeral at home. ", "A home funeral can encompass a memorial service, wake, viewing or a combination of the three. It's also an intimate experience: Friends or family members might help wash and dress the body, build or decorate a casket, plan a memorial service or accompany the deceased to the burial site or crematory.", "After Daron died at her home in Bellevue, Wash., Howley kept her there for two days. Family members washed and dressed the body of the teenager who loved soccer and played the cello, placed dry ice under her torso to slow decomposition and moved her to a back bedroom so visitors could pay their last respects. A sister who flew in from New York painted Daron's nails and applied her makeup. Howley slept in the same room as Daron.", "        Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring. ", 'About 2.4 million people in the U.S. died in 2004, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About a third of them were cremated. ', "While it's difficult to track how many home funerals are held each year, Carlson says she's noticed an increase in inquiries. And this year, the nonprofit People's Memorial Association of Seattle began offering members the option of choosing a home funeral coordinated by Barrett's A Sacred Moment. ", 'The average cost of a funeral in 2004, not including cemetery costs, was about $6,500, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. Price varies considerably, depending on whether the body is cremated or buried and whether the family chooses a plain pine box or an expensive casket.', 'In contrast, Barrett says a home funeral and cremation can cost less than $1,000 if the family does everything including transporting the body to the crematory. For complete assistance with a three-day home funeral, which includes consultation, preparation of the body, purchase of dry ice, daily check-ins with the family, officiating of a memorial service and burial with a basic cloth-covered casket, the amount is about $2,000. That price does not include cemetery costs.', "But the real value of a home funeral, Barrett says, isn't in the dollars saved but rather in slowing down the process and allowing the family to have some last, precious time with the loved one. ", 'For families who choose a home funeral, she recommends placing the body in a back room so mourners do not have to look at it unless they choose to do so. ', 'Even home funeral advocates acknowledge the experience is not for everyone. It might not be the best arrangement if a death is sudden, if a body is disfigured or if not everyone in the family agrees on it, Barrett says.', "Families should have a candid conversation about death, Slocum said. Tell your loved ones what you want and ask what's meaningful to them.", 'Howley has already told her remaining children her wishes for a home funeral when she dies. ', 'An advantage of a home funeral is that a family is truly in charge, Barrett says. After all, they knew the one who died the best. ']
