Do do it hasn't ended the nightmare still coming down in the form of rain at times relentless rain and that is the biggest and most urgent issue facing central Oklahoma right now. Flash flooding we're still hearing about dangerous conditions. All over on some of the highways and some of the smaller roads to you will of course find -- awful lot more overnight. But here's what I want -- now about what we know about what happened today. I'm standing in front of a community college you can't see much here because it is -- -- dark at this hour. But it is right here in El Reno one of the first spots that was affected by the tornadoes. It -- this out and just basically took the inside out I think that's how a lot of -- they're feeling here. They had had so much torn from -- and torn apart time and again and now. Five new reported tornadoes right here. I was watching these storms come toward the city and I got this feeling in my stomach. I thought how could be happening again really to track and that same way but really this time going straight to the city. And that as we were getting out we got stuck in gridlock like so many others I 44 I 35 and -- forty huge huge highways here. And they were almost shut down now one storm case there and I know this guy Brandon Sullivan. He was trying to get away from the tornado because it was wobbling I was watching the radar very odd the way that it moved north and south southeast and northeast.
