But there were also tears, lots of them, as they said farewell to their loved ones.', '"The hardest part is leaving my family," said Maj. Greg Worden, a mission leader for the unit, who stood near his wife. "When I\'m there, I\'ll be able to fill my time with work, but my family will have to suffer that gap without much to fill it."', 'The unit, which is based at Fort Gordon, will soon depart for Camp Atterbury, Ind., before deploying in late May to southeastern Afghanistan, where it will spend a year teaching farmers to better grow, irrigate and market their foodstuffs.', "In an interview this month, Worden said the unit's goal will be to orient the farmers toward a market-based approach to their work instead of simply subsisting on the apples and wheat they grow. It's part of the military's strategy to instill confidence in the Afghan government by trying to reverse the country's agricultural decline brought on by years of warfare.", '"After two generations of war, some of the hydrology is destroyed and they have to learn to maintain and rebuild," Worden said. "Our goal is to get these farmers and their support elements back up to speed and get some confidence in the local government."', "The unit is the first of its kind in Georgia, and its members have prepared for their deployment by learning about soil sciences, animal nutrition, fruit production and even bee farming at the University of Georgia's College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. Recently, they were at Fort Stewart, near Savannah, where they brushed up on combat training.", "In his remarks to the unit, their commander, Col.
