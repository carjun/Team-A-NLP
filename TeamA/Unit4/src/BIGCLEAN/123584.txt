There, Nancy's mother confronted him at his court appearance.", "Despite the jury's ruling that Nancy's death had been a homicide, the DA came to court and told a judge...there's no case here.", "District Attorney Thom LeDoux: I believe that there's not evidence to file criminal charges at this time.", "For starters, the DA points out that while the jurors may have believed Nancy was murdered, the panel was undecided on the question of what actually killed her...Was it a broken neck? Or maybe a drowning? Perhaps a blow to the head? They couldn't say. And there were no remains to reexamine.", 'And where the investigators see suspicious behavior, the DA sees plausible explanations.', "And driving the wrong way to look for help? Maybe that's because they were distraught, disoriented.", 'Dennis Murphy: Don\'t you always say to jurors, "Look, rely on your common sense,"?', "But even if he could put Dan's ex-wife on the stand, the DA says the fact that they were married for 12-years might play to the defenses hand.", "LeDoux also points out that, as with any cold case, memories can become unreliable. The Clevelands, for example, weren't even interviewed for months...and now 5 years have gone by.", 'Thom LeDoux: I have relied on the on-scene observations of the members of my staff.', "And finally, that so-called smoking gun document investigators found in Dan and Efren's house, outling the event of that day?", 'Dennis Murphy: Jurors would look at that and say, "That stinks. Why do these two guys have a script, a common story that they\'ve worked out?"', 'So after spending 10 days in police custody, Efren Gallegos was let go. The search for Dan Mason...was called off.', 'We went looking for him, to find out what he had to say about that day on Chalk Creek. ', "Thom LeDoux: To be honest with you, it really wasn't a very difficult decision to make. ", 'The lawmen, who have doggedly pursued the case for years, also respectfully disagree with their DA.', "Rob Martellaro: Obviously there's problems with the case. But there's still a lot of good parts to this case, a lot of good evidence in this case. ", "He'd been a wanted man for just a few days in late spring, remember, but police had lost track of him.", "She knew nothing about the investigation in Colorado when they met, but says she didn't trust him from the get-go...", 'Gloria Donovan: It was everything. His whole behavior. It was all fake and phony and deliberate.', "Dan is currently dating one of Gloria's close friends, someone she describes as both wealthy and naive. ", 'Gloria Donovan: He wanted to marry her right away, and have her go to Las Vegas. ', "We, of course, wanted to talk to Dan, ask him about his wife's death...his actions on that day and in the months that followed.", "So we went to the home where he's apparently living with his new female companion. She answered the door and told us Dan wasn't there.", "He didn't talk to us on camera, but has communicated by e-mail, sending Dateline ", ' In it, he says he\'s an "innocent American citizen" "who is being bullied" by certain members of the "Colorado legal system."', "As proof of innocence, Dan Mason cites the DA's refusal to prosecute and the coroner's original determination that Nancy's death was accidental.", 'And he says he has repeatedly answered questions about what happened that day...and has never changed his account of events.', "Rob Martellaro: It's possible that two people that committed a crime are never gonna answer for it. ", "But there is one more card to turn over. The case isn't dead yet, but it's a legal longshot. In a highly unusual move, the sheriff and county coroner had asked a Colorado judge to appoint a special prosecutor to try the two men for murder. ", 'Just today, they withdrew that request, but say they plan to file it again after refining their legal strategy.', 'Keith Pinkston: At least we can go to the Gaede family and tell them that we did everything we could. We took it as far as we could. And we gave it everything we had for Nancy and for them. ', "For now, Nancy's family is left with her scrapbooks to refresh their memories...", "Gone with a scream and a headlong plunge into a furious rocky creek. Or maybe it happened another way? That's the mystery of it all that's just eating some people up. The whitewater of Chalk Creek may roar, but no one can make out its words."]
