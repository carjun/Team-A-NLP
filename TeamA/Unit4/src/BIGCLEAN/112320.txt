['        Are humans destined to morph into a genetically and cybernetically modified master race? Have we been able to suspend the rules of natural selection, or will our wasteful ways catch up with us big time? Are we doomed to failure, or are we destined to muddle through pretty much as humans always have?', 'Over the past month, we\'ve received about 600 e-mails musing on such questions, in response to our "Fast Forward" report on speculative scenarios for future human evolution.', 'Some were tickled to hear how experts rated the prospects for Unihumans (globally blended culture), Survivalistians (adapted for the post-apocalypse), Cyborgs (machine-human hybrids), Numans (genetically modified elite) and Astrans (optimized for interstellar colonization). The report was even adapted for newspaper publication in The Australian.', '"People will evolve to the point where they no longer write crap like this article," wrote Bob Meyer of Kirkland, Wash.', 'For the record, when we asked MSNBC.com users to rate the likelihood of the various survival scenarios, the top vote-getter in our ', "The scenarios were drawn up under the assumption that the human species would not go extinct, but would be subject to evolutionary pressures that would change its character over the course of millions of years. A good number of readers took issue with those assumptions: Some said they were sure humanity's days were numbered. Others said the rules of natural selection would be suspended as long as humans were the planet's dominant species. Still others relied on religious texts to contend that evolution itself was a scientific fiction.", 'Then there were writers who put forth their own scenarios for future evolution. For example, why bother keeping the Astrans in suspended animation? A robot-controlled ship could simply carry stores of sperm and eggs to an outlying planet for "seeding" when the time was right.', "Some of the e-mails were deadly serious. Others were downright funny, and that kind of good humor is just what's needed when you're discussing a subject that contains at least as much science fiction as science fact. Speaking of that, several readers recommended science-fiction novels or speculative books that go into far more depth on the subject of future evolution.", "You'll find reading recommendations and snarky comments as well as serious reflection in the following selection of e-mails:", 'One factor not mentioned in your scenarios is that of sending sperm and eggs on "slow boats" into space. [The sperm and eggs] would be combined by selectively intelligent robotics at a long distant future time. The humans would be educated, again by selectively intelligent "teachers," and then they would take over for themselves. In such a program, more than likely only the most highly developed (of current times) would be selected for contributions, and therefore a natural "super" race be the result. Keep in mind that after the great many years of travel needed have passed, base humanity may well have surpassed that technique and have futuristic humans waiting to greet those arriving on the slow boat.', 'I think, as more technology develops, we will just evolve into "Lumps." A "Lump" is just a large set of buttocks with two eyes and four stubby appendages. This comes from sitting behind desks, lounging in front of the TV, or surfing the Net and not really needing to go out and do much of anything.', 'Stem cell research may revolutionize medicine just like penicillin or organ transplantation, but it is being demonized by those who do not understand science. Each scientific advancement has improved life as we know it, and I believe future ones will continue to do so. However, I do believe we have the capacity to destroy our environment if we ignore the scientific principles we know exist and do not heed them.', "I am extremely disappointed with your attempts at an intelligent article. It is obvious that very little, if any, attempt was made to reconcile these far-reaching statements with simple Mendelian ratios. A little math of the multiplication variety would immediately show you that a larger interbreeding pool does not lower variety: Your concerns about losing racial variety are completely unfounded. I don't have a problem with you printing complete science fiction, but if you want to try to sell it to the reality-based community known as science, I suggest you at least consult a population geneticist first. ", 'Human history will span less time than that of the dinosaurs. We will continue to lengthen our life span and save human lives that in days past would have been lost; human overpopulation will continue at a devastating pace. We will stretch well beyond the capabilities of Planet Earth to sustain us. The only question that remains is: when we finally destroy ourselves, how much of the planet will we take with us?', 'Unfortunately, I see humankind evolving into the domesticated version. One of the key aspects of civilization has been the declining emphasis on individual ability (intelligence/skill) and the increasing impact of genetic resistance to disease. Modern medicine and genetic engineering will only strengthen this trend as religious traditionalists will prevent measurable diversion from "God\'s creation." In time ... a new disease will rip out the heart of societies worldwide (remember the black plague?) and all that will be left are some lemmings who don\'t understand their tools well enough to continue to survive.', '\t    Unihuman: Skin tones blend. Larger eyes are associated with greater "domestication."', 'I think the "Unihuman" is far too light to represent a blend of all races on earth. In the global context, fair skin is in the minority. In India and the Middle East, there are people with skins as dark as what people think of as African.', 'No one has mentioned the way that domesticated animals are manipulated or improved: by selective breeding. Of course, this is such a politically volatile topic that it will seldom be discussed openly, let alone tried. We know many attributes including intelligence have a large genetic component. If one were to truly improve the human species, one would promote the interbreeding of those individuals that represent the best of the characteristics we wish to enhance. Likewise, we would prevent or at least limit the breeding of those from the shallow end of the gene pool.', "The dramatic rise in cases of autism and the research it has spawned may shed light upon our future evolution. The human brain is possibly evolving into a new form which will be truly amazing by today's standards. It is known through studies of savants that the human brain is capable of computerlike computation and memory feats. Yet the vast majority of savants are cognitively disabled. New modern studies of savants indicate that all humans have dormant subconscious savant activity going on.

As Einstein said, "I don\'t know which weapons we will fight World War III with, but I know World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."', 'It\'s my opinion that no one of the scenarios will occur, but rather a combination. The best example of my view of the path that future human evolution is likely to take is Bruce Sterling\'s book "Schismatrix," where the engineered evolutionary paths of population groups diverge and converge due to social and philosophical pressures/identities. Basically, evolutionary variation will be driven by social/cultural isolation and/or divergence, not geographical isolation.', 'The Ringworld series by Larry Niven investigates the divergence of a proto-human spacefaring race. On the Ringworld, "breeders" evolve to fill many ecological niches.', "With the kind of diseases that are popping up, and with the earth becoming poisoned and depleted of essentials for human survival, I do not think the species will last a whole lot of years to expect to see the effects of genetic blending that is taking place. Because of the very unnatural mode of living today, evolution will not result in the survival of the fittest gene, and therefore the slightest unexpected natural calamity could destroy the human race. There will certainly be a new species that would evolve, which is likely to inhabit the waters or maybe below the earth's crust for survival.", '"Which of the scenarios for the future of humans sounds most likely to you?" Why can\'t you say it? The false journalistic objectivity? The fear of bias? My rough estimates:', 'The missing road is, of course, the posthuman, radically different forms, including, for example, uploading, merging of humans into hive minds, etc. The article is nice, but fundamentally flawed, because it treats all speculation as equally valid, which is obviously wrong.

In this case, the programmed robots will be in charge until the human(Astrans) arrive. Then both the robots and humans (Astrans) should be working together to do the rest of the work.', 'Our children are our future. So how you want them to become depends entirely on the social etiquette of the day. If designer babies become the trend, will we be following the footsteps of the megalomaniac Hitler?

So, teachers, governments, cults and societies, beware what you fill the minds of impressionable youths with.

We will squeeze genetically modified squirrels like oranges in order to produce enough syrup.', 'I for one vote for the human race evolving into a race of eyeless mole-men and doing the bidding of an evil rat overlord and his minions. I suppose it would be farfetched to assume that they would offer a good dental plan. I plan to help this genetic mutation along by offering seminars on how to burrow blindfolded.', 'During the research currently under way on disease-resistant genes, higher IQs and stronger physiques, humans will adopt machine parts to aid in survival. The problem with humans is, we never leave well enough alone. These machine parts will become prototypes for the geneticists to manipulate our genome to replicate the machines\' functions with our natural bodies. This will, for a short span, give rise to a caste system, and I use the term "caste system" loosely. With the new knowledge of replicating machine function with our genetics, humans will be able to manipulate genes at will. Radiation-resistant on Monday. Water breather on Wednesday. Super jock for the weekend games by Friday.', 'I submit for consideration that we may be looking in the wrong direction to determine how we originated as a species. Instead of looking backward and studying fossils, we should look forward with computer models and see how long it would take for our science to evolve sufficiently for us to "write a DNA" of our own. DNA is, after all, just a miniature computer program using four-bit words. Consider how our programming and miniaturization skills have evolved in the last 30 years. Now project that rate of discovery ahead another 30 years ... 100 years ... 1 million years! Is it inconceivable that we will know how to write self-sustaining programs like DNA? Now how much of a leap is it to say that we were programmed or created in just this manner?', "Evolution is just too slow a process to explain today's diversity of life forms. How many accidental evolutions does it take to create rods and cones in an eye? But what if we suppose an alien species evolved over trillions of years into a higher life form, sat down and created DNA as a homework assignment and then sent the resultant DNA floating through the universe waiting for it to find a supportive environment?"]
