['Ray Lewis, Brian Urlacher and Ronde Barber grabbed the headlines by retiring, walking away from the game when they almost certainly still could have contributed to NFL teams.', "What's the deal? Or, better yet, why haven't these solid players gotten any deals yet?", "Here's a Pick 6 of positions where veterans with strong resumes are available, maybe even for a discounted price:", "DEFENSIVE LINE: NFL teams really bulked up on defensive linemen in this year's draft, with nine selected in the first round. But with rotations on the D-line the norm, most rosters will have eight linemen who get onto the field in each game.", 'RUNNING BACK: Most teams are set with their starter, but as just about every club outside of Minneapolis and Seattle has discovered, more than one running back is essential.', 'On the market is McGahee, released by Denver in a youth movement and for salary cap purposes. Also available are Cedric Benson, Beanie Wells, Brandon Jacobs and Michael Turner.

Other wideouts available are Randy Moss, Early Doucet and, yes, even Terrell Owens and Chad Johnson.", "DEFENSIVE BACKS: Teams tend to bring in and send out DBs all the time, so future employment seems likely for safeties Rhodes, Quintin Mikell and Jordan Babineaux. Same for cornerbacks William Middleton, Stanford Routt and Sheldon Brown. But they'll probably need to play special teams, too.", "QUARTERBACKS: You won't find any likely starters here, maybe not even No. 2 QBs, but among those who could lend experience somewhere are Young, a former Offensive Rookie of the Year, Byron Leftwich and Matt Leinart.", 'You are using an outdated version of Internet Explorer.
